Novel cytotoxic and biological agents for prostate cancer: where will the money be in 2005?
In 2004, docetaxel-based chemotherapy became the first treatment capable of extending life in androgen-independent prostate cancer. The era of therapeutic nihilism in this disease has thus been put to rest and a broad range of agents is being tested with the goal of improving on the successes of 2004. Lessons learned from other tumour types will need to be applied to prostate cancer in order to harness the bounty of available ideas. Target amplification or activating mutations and not merely the presence of a target are likely to be important to the success of targeted agents. Thus, the promise of the current crop of targeted agents is most likely to be realised when pursued in the context of well-credentialed targets and tested in highly translational clinical trials that are capable not only of assessing tumour response, but also of evaluating the status of the targeted pathway. The most promising agents in clinical development are reviewed.

An emerging clinical approach to treat substance abuse disorders involves a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy whereby addicts learn to reduce their reactivity to drug-paired stimuli through cue-exposure or extinction training. It is, however, unlikely that extinction training would be consistently effective as a stand- alone treatment in populations that have abused drugs long-term because the key memory systems that are recruited during extinction training are impaired by long-term drug use. There is a critical need to understand mechanisms underlying extinction learning and to establish viable strategies to increase the efficacy of extinction therapies for substance abuse disorders. Key elements of the proposed research plan build on recent advances made in the treatment of conditioned fear and anxiety and other cognitive disorders by pharmacological modulation of glycine, an obligatory co-transmitter at the NMDA glutamate receptor complex. The specific aims of the proposed research in rats and non-human primates are to: 1) elucidate the neurobiological substrates of extinction learning; 2) evaluate selected glycine site partial agonists and glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors as candidate pharmacotherapies to increase the efficacy of extinction training; and 3) determine neurobiological substrates of glycine site modulation of extinction learning. The intravenous cocaine self-administration procedure will be used in the proposed studies because the contingency between drug delivery and behavior is likely paramount for understanding the persistent abuse of drugs in people. Measurement of Fos protein expression (a marker for neuronal activation) and evaluation with anisomycin (an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis) will be used in rats to investigate the neurobiological substrates of extinction learning following cocaine self-administration training. In addition, the proposed research in rats and non-human primates will specifically investigate the effects of the partial glycine agonist D-cycloserine and selective GlyT1 inhibitors for their ability to accelerate extinction learning and to subsequently reduce cocaine cue reactivity and re-acquisition of cocaine self-administration. Animal research involving pharmacological modulation of learning and memory is well-served by an integrated comparative strategy using appropriately selected laboratory animals. This approach is especially relevant for research involving cognitive enhancing drugs, where non-human primates can serve as a key translational interface for the development of pharmacotherapies.

Host lymphodepletion augments T cell adoptive immunotherapy through enhanced intratumoral proliferation of effector cells.
T-cell adoptive immunotherapy for stringent murine tumor models, such as intracranial, s.c., or advanced pulmonary metastases, routinely uses lymphodepletive conditioning regimens before T-cell transfer, like recent clinical protocols. In this study, we examined whether host lymphodepletion is an obligatory component of curative T-cell therapy; we also examined the mechanism by which it augments therapy. Mice bearing intracranial, s.c., or 10-day pulmonary metastases of MCA 205 received total body irradiation conditioning or were nonirradiated before i.v. transfer of tumor-reactive T cells. Total body irradiation was not required for immunologically specific curative therapy and induction of memory provided that a 3- to 12-fold higher T-cell dose was administered. The mechanism involved enhanced intratumoral proliferation of T-effector cells in total body irradiation-conditioned recipients. In this tumor model, intratumoral T(reg) cells were not detected; consequently, intratumoral T-effector cells produced identical amounts of IFN-gamma upon ex vivo antigen stimulation irrespective of total body irradiation conditioning. Thus, host lymphodepletion augments T-cell immunotherapy through enhanced antigen-driven proliferation of T-effector cells, but curative therapy can be achieved in nonconditioned hosts by escalation of T-cell dose. These data provide a rationale for dose escalation of T-effector cells in situations where single or repeated lymphodepletion regimens are contraindicated.

Ranking systems have their limitations and imperfections – we know. Yet it’s worth sharing that the latest U.S. News & World Report list puts OHSU at no. 3 for excellence in primary care education.. Fifty-five of our 121 fourth-year med students, or 46 percent, are entering residency in primary care this year, which includes internal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics. While many of these students will go on to sub-specialize, this continues to be a strong initial showing in primary care, compared to many other areas of the country. While this is down somewhat from 2011 when 62 percent matched to primary care, it is consistent with trends from 2008-2010.. Complete OHSU rankings include:. - Overall research #37 (tied with University of Maryland). - Primary care #3 (tied with UC-San Francisco). - Family Medicine #5 (tied with University of New Mexico). - Rural Medicine #12 (tied with eight other institutions)

It seems that Americans might not be the only ones to be at the receiving end of the thriving business of credit card fraud emanating from India. After the Maharashtra Police unearthed a massive credit card fraud scam by raiding Thane-based call centres and arresting scores of individuals accused of duping close to 6,000 Americans, Canadian authorities have raised alarm about 'suspicious phone callers with Indian accent.'

According to the probe agency, scores of Canadian residents have complained to the authorities in their country about marketers and callers asking them about their personal information. The complainants have also stated that most of the callers have an 'Indian accent' and tend to be pushy while asking personal information which mostly is about credit card details.

The revelation was made by some senior officials of the CBI who said that the issue was brought up during a recently held meeting with the Commissioner of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Bob Paulson.

"Several issues were discussed during the meeting and most of them focused on greater co-operation between Canadian and Indian investigating bodies. Some of the points discussed during the meeting were related to inquiries and judicial requests made by our agency in connection to criminal cases probed by CBI. While our Canadian counterpart assured better cooperation from their end, there were some issues raised by them in which they would be needing our assistance. One of them is of credit card fraud and the matter seems to be serious and urgent in nature,"a senior CBI official told DNA.

"According to the RMCP in the last few months there have been multiple complaints from Canadian citizens claiming that they have been receiving calls from people with an Indian accent. The numbers from which they have been receiving these calls seem to be originating from two-three countries and we intend to work with out Canadian counterparts to probe this matter further," the officer said.

According to CBI officials, as seen in the past, syndicates operating a credit card scam system, are generally not based out of any one particular country. Similarly the numbers from which these fraud calls are made can be concealed using commonly available technology or through sim cards acquired illegally by syndicate members.

Mumbai case

Thane based call centres, which had more than 2,000 employees, have come under police investigation for allegedly duping Americans by pretending to be Internal Revenue Service officials and threatening them with tax investigations if they did not pay up. The police has also issued a Look Out Circular (LOC) to nab Sagar Dharmesh Thakkar, the alleged mastermind of the scam which is believed to have procured almost rupees 500 crore from American citizens

Randomized Study to Evaluate the Impact of Telemedicine Care in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes With Multiple Doses of Insulin and Suboptimal HbA1c in Andalusia (Spain): PLATEDIAN Study.
To assess the impact of a telemedicine visit using the platform Diabetic compared with a face-to-face visit, on clinical outcomes, patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and physicians' satisfaction in patients with type 1 diabetes. PLATEDIAN (Telemedicine on Metabolic Control in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Andalusian Patients) (NCT03332472) was a multicenter, randomized, 6-month follow-up, open-label, parallel-group controlled study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes with suboptimal metabolic control (HbA1c <8% [<64 mmol/mol]), treated with multiple daily injections. A total of 388 patients were assessed for eligibility; 379 of them were randomized 1:1 to three face-to-face visits (control cohort [CC]) (n = 167) or the replacement of an intermediate face-to-face visit by a telemedicine visit using Diabetic (intervention cohort [IC]) (n = 163). The primary efficacy end point was the mean change of HbA1c levels from baseline to month 6. Other efficacy and safety end points were mean blood glucose, glucose variability, episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, patient-reported outcomes, and physicians' satisfaction. At month 6, the mean change in HbA1c levels was -0.04 ± 0.5% (-0.5 ± 5.8 mmol/mol) in the CC and 0.01 ± 0.6% (0.1 ± 6.0 mmol/mol) in the IC (P = 0.4941). The number of patients who achieved HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) was 73 and 78 in the CC and IC, respectively. Significant differences were not found regarding safety end points at 6 months. Changes in HRQoL between the first visit and final visit did not differ between cohorts, and, regarding fear of hypoglycemia (FH-15 ≥28), statistically significant differences observed at baseline remained unchanged at 6 months (P < 0.05). The use of telemedicine in patients with type 1 diabetes with HbA1c <8% (<64 mmol/mol) provides similar efficacy and safety outcomes as face-to-face visits.

NBC Universal is looking at “The View”-style talk shows with multiple hosts to possibly replace “The Meredith Vieira Show” as its ratings slump behind syndicated competitors, sources told Page Six. stars Tamar demographic — younger, more multicultural — to Meredith’s later-afternoon time slot.”. NBC has already tinkered with Vieira’s format in an effort to boost ratings.. The normally pretaped show was done live the week of Jan. 19, and has recently been featuring multiple guests to talk about topics like parenting and health.. Vieira recently had author Steve Santagati, former New York Giant Michael Clayton and TV host Steve Wilkos for a panel on “what your man really thinks.”. But other NBC insiders insist the network isn’t looking to replace Vieira just yet.. “With any show, you tinker with different things to see what works,” one source said, adding that the panel could become part of the program. A rep for Vieira’s show had no comment.

Springfield Partner Carole Lynch and Associate Denise M. Tremblay recently obtained summary judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiff, a former director of our client—the board of trustees of a municipal library—alleged that the Board violated his 1st Amendment rights (under 42 U.S.C. § 1983) by retaliating against him in pursuing termination of his employment and breached his contract of employment. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his claim for violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, M.G.L. c. 12, after receiving the motion for summary judgment. The judge ruled in favor of our client on the 1st Amendment claim on the grounds that the Board did not act under color of state law as its members were not “state actors.” In the alternative, the Court held that the Board was entitled to qualified immunity. The Court also entered judgment on the breach of contract claim.

Why mobile search was inevitable from 1997

Way back in May 1997, AOL finalized some amazing new technology based around its so called “OSCAR” protocolﾠwhich eventually became AOL’s flagship instant messaging system.

ﾠ

Why was this so amazing?

ﾠ

Well, it may seem something which we all take for granted in the new millenium, but at the time it was revolutionary for users to be able to communicate in real time. Furthermore, this was rolled out on a commercial scale and it proved to be a real game changer, not just for internet usage but also for broader human communication.

ﾠ

Early dominance

ﾠ

AOL’s Instant Messaging system became known simply as “AIM” and it completely dominated the market in the early 2000s. This tells us a number of things:

ﾠ

1. The developed world was eager to be able to communicate in real time, both for social and commercial reasons.

2. Business was desirous of shorter “feedback loops”, as a means of staff development and of shortening their sales cycles.

3. Collaboration in fields such as mathematics, science, education and politics became much easier, albeit creating at the same time some inherent risks.ﾠ

ﾠ

Demise

ﾠ

By 2009, however, use of AIM had largely become non-existent. This was due to a number of reasons:

ﾠ

1. Ageing technology: as processing speeds and the complexity of computing accelerated, so did demands on what was expected of AIM and its competition. New operating systems were tried, noteably the AOL XMPP Gateway. This allowsﾠthird party messaging networks to exchange messages and presence information with the AIM service. Use of the gateway is currently limited to select partners, and AOL state that parties interested in using the XMPP gateway should contact them.ﾠUse of AOL’s XMPP Gateway was and is governed by proprietary terms of service.ﾠCommercially, this was perceived as restrictive and gradually other solutions became more popular.

2. Portability: the advent of mobile phones with 3G rendered the need to be at an office or desktop unneccessary when wanting to instant message, whether by SMS or other means.ﾠ

3. Apple: Apple products surged in popularity, wiping many competitors off the map including this technology.

ﾠ

What next?

ﾠ

Looking back, it was clear that there was a desire for real time mobile communication technologies. It was inevitable, even in 1997, that technology would deliver solutions to this and the fascinating question now is how this trend will continue. It is not clear, however, that we have seen the last of AIM. Take a look at the following video for more details.

Channel 4 has appointed Alex Mahon, the former boss of the maker of MasterChef and Broadchurch, who now runs the special effects firm behind Hollywood blockbusters including Gravity and Guardians of the Galaxy, as its new chief executive.

Mahon becomes the first woman to run a UK broadcaster larger than Channel 5. She is the first female Channel 4 chief executive in the broadcaster’s 35-year history.

“Alex is an outstanding leader and a highly experienced chief executive who has developed and grown major international businesses in both the creative and technology sectors,” said the Channel 4 chairman, Charles Gurassa.

Jay Hunt quits Channel 4 post just days before decision on top job

“She brings an impressive combination of relevant experience and is brilliantly placed to help steer Channel 4 through the competitive challenges and opportunities ahead.”

Mahon will take over from David Abraham, who leaves later this year, and will immediately face the prospect of negotiations with the government over the relocation of Channel 4 out of London.

Scottish-born Mahon has previously worked closely with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, having served as a member of the advisory panel put together to help map out the future scope and remit of the BBC ahead of the renewal of its royal charter last year.

“She is a great enthusiast for Channel 4 and its unique public service remit and her recent work with government will be valuable in facilitating constructive dialogue with the new administration,” said Gurassa.

Mahon is expected to start the £900,000 a year job in October or November and will be involved with the appointment of Hunt’s successor.

Hunt is due to leave at the end of September, after handling the launch of Great British Bake Off which the broadcaster poached from the BBC last year.

“Channel 4’s unique remit to innovate and to appeal to young and diverse audiences make it an essential part of British culture,” said Mahon. “There is nowhere in the world like Channel 4 and, in these changing times, its mission is more important than ever. I’m incredibly proud to be joining Channel 4 and bring to it experience both of leading creative organisations at scale and dealing with an environment of constant technological change.”

Mahon joins from Foundry, a design and visual effects software firm with film credits including Guardians of the Galaxy and technology licensing deals with Hollywood heavyweights such as Disney, Weta Digital and Sony Pictures Imageworks, which she has run since 2015.

Calixarene Assisted Rapid Synthesis of Silver-Graphene Nanocomposites with Enhanced Antibacterial Activity.
Demonstrated herein is a single rapid approach employed for synthesis of Ag-graphene nanocomposites, with excellent antibacterial properties and low cytotoxicity, by utilizing a continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) process in combination with p-hexasulfonic acid calix[6]arene (SCX6) as an effective particle stabilizer. The nanocomposites showed high activity against E. coli (Gram-negative) and S. aureus (Gram-positive) bacteria. The materials were characterized using a range of techniques including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectrophotometry, FT-IR, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). This rapid, single step synthetic approach not only provides a facile means of enabling and controlling graphene reduction (under alkaline conditions) but also offers an optimal route for homogeneously producing and depositing highly crystalline Ag nanostructures into reduced graphene oxide substrate.

North American Single-footing Horse

The North American Single-footing Horse, also called the Single-footing Horse or Single-footer, is a horse breed originating in the southern United States. The term "single-foot" refers to an intermediate ambling gait, sometimes alternately called the rack or paso largo, where the horse lifts each foot up separately and puts it down alone.

Characteristics
The Single-footing Horse comes in a wide range of colors, including palomino and buckskin, as well as chestnut, gray, and bay.
The Single-footing Horse is a medium-sized breed of light riding horse. It is primarily known for its intermediate four-beat gait, which may range from 7 to 9 miles per hour on a trail ride to over 15 miles per hour at a road speed. High speeds in excess of 20 mph have been recorded.

Uses
The breed is almost always used for trail or pleasure riding. All Single-footers must be shod in plain keg shoes (a standard machine-made shoe) in order to maintain registration.

History
The Single-footing Horse is descended from crosses of American Saddlebreds, Standardbreds, and other gaited breeds, with some influence from Spanish bloodlines. An influential stallion was EZD Falcon Rowdy, who also influenced the Racking Horse breed.

breaks. . Swing the End of the World. Deep in the wilds of Ecuador is a seismic monitoring station known as Casa del Arbol (in the original Casa del Arbol). Its purpose is to observe the activity of the Tungurahua volcano, which is located nearby. This volcano woke up on August 19, 1999. Since then, climbing it has been banned, and it is under scrutiny. The station is a small tree house. Which can already be considered a landmark, since it is located on the edge of a fairly deep cliff. But much more interesting are the swings that hang from the branches of a tree, right next to the station (more like a large birdhouse). All over the world, these swings are known as “swings at the end of the world” or “end of the world” swings.

we used the metro but you have to change once. the pavements are not smooth if you have luggage on wheels and it is a good 5 minute walk with a bit of a hill, so takes a bit of effort.. There is a fantastic minibus service at the airport called Minibud. It took us directly to the hotel and collected us for the return. Literally door to door. The price was extremely reasonable and so convenient. Cannot recommend it enough.. we took a shuttle bus which was direct but we had a bit of a wait.. We booked the transfer with jet2.

We always have a great time when Branson joins us for our weekly Legend's dinner with Grammy & Pa. He's so full of personality and gets a long with both girls so well. :). We survived another first day of school! It was a pretty smooth morning, even Drew cooperated by sleeping most of the night and waking up to have breakfast with the girls! School is starting 10 minutes earlier than last year so we were up and at it at 6:30 to make sure we had enough time to park and walk the girls in...plus take pictures. Lots and lots of pictures!. Ava was pretty excited to go see her friends but I think as the time for leaving for school neared she got more and more nervous. She went from bubbly and talkative to a little more solemn. She did at least smile for a picture or two! :)

I have two boys who race BMX.. we travel all over for their me races and it’s become a lifestyle for our family. There is a lot of down time and the weapon of choice has been the mini bikes for several years. The first mini bike I purchased was a very well known brand and it seemed to perform well. However - I stared noticing other brands making minis that seemed equal in quality but about half the price. So when it came time to replace the bike I went with the cheaper less known brand of mini. I didn’t notice and difference in quality between the two brands. About month ago I saw a kid kit one of the races cruising the pits on a mini that looked nothing like I’d seen before. I figured some rich Factory dad had somehow found the parts to build a custom mini.. just be taking a quick glance it was obvious this mini was top of the line . Later I was able to find out it was not a custom build.. it was a Wildcat MIni that he purchased complete . The bike was similiar in price ronthe more welll known brand of mini sold in the U.S. I decided to purchase the bike and if has exceeded all’s expectations. Its smoother, faster and I would argue nicer looking then any other mini out there. My sons both love riding these bikes over anything else the have - including their race bikes which which both cost over 2k to build. You can find mini’s cheaper then Wildacat- but if they are gonna be riding a lot and you want a top notch bike this is the best there is and I’ve seen several. Until a new company emerges that can do better - wildcat is without the best bang for your buck and I will certainly be buying another Willscat once it’s time to replace the two we have now -

WOW Nathan - thank you so much for such a comprehensive review on the Wildcat Original 1B.
We really appreciate it. We strive to be the market leader in the development of Mini BMX bikes - we want our pride to be riding the best, the lightest and the strongest.

Tiny and tough! Super fun! I wish they existed when I was a kid! My little groms and I love it! Here’s a couple pics of myself playing with our new Mini freak. I’m 175 and this thing is as tough as my 20” bike and is a rush to ride! Well done to the wildcat crew for sending this gap in the in the market for young riders and adults alike. Tiny shred!!!

That’s the absolute best Edward. We love seeing dads get in on the action. Thanks for your positive review and so pleased that you and your little groms are diggin it.

[Development of direct phlebography for surgical intervention of the varix cruris].
To determine the appropriate treatment for patients with varix cruris, we performed three different methods of phlebography including direct phlebography, and compared their findings by each phlebography. Conventional ascending phlebography was taken routinely and initially in all limbs (n = 120). "Direct phlebography" developed by us was then indicated, when the visualization of the deep vein system was unclear by conventional ascending phlebography. This method was useful for the clear opacification of the deep vein system, and also was able to visualize the deep femoral vein clearly. After the precise diagnosis of varix cruris, descending phlebography under the Valsalva maneuver at supine position was carried out for the evaluation of the deep vein insufficiency. According to these phlebographic findings, conventional stripping with or without sub- or suprafascial ligation of communicating vein was indicated to saphenous typed varix cruris. The valvuloplasty to the highest valve in superficial femoral vein was carefully added in eight limbs which showed the significant reflux by added in eight limbs which showed the significant reflux by the descending phlebography. This valvuloplasty was remarkably contributed to the immediate healing of the stasis ulcer without recurrence. And compression sclerotherapy was selected to some patients with branch typed varix cruris.

BRUSSELS -- European Union ambassadors appear set to prolong asset freezes and visa bans against 146 individuals and 37 entities that, according to the EU, are responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity.

EU sources have told RFE/RL that the decision to prolong the measures by six months will be taken ahead of a September 15 deadline without much discussion.

The targets of the sanctions include companies in Crimea and various battalions formed by the Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, as well as Russian politicians like Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and Dmitry Kiselyov, a state media executive and presenter whom many regard as the Kremlin's chief propagandist.

The sanctions were first introduced in March 2014 after Russia's seizure and illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.

The EU's economic sanctions that target Russia's energy, military, and financial sectors are up for renewal on January 31.

EU sources told RFE/RL that those sectoral sanctions will be discussed at a Brussels summit of EU leaders in October.

Removal of the distal 75% of the pancreas may be done in adults without producing diabetes or deficiency of external pancreatic secretion. This procedure is often employed in the treatment of malignant and benign tumors. Resection of the body and tail of the pancreas may also be useful in treatment of an occasional patient who sustains severe trauma to the pancreas with complete transection, or with a crushing injury involving the distal portion of this organ. Little data are available, however, concerning the effect of extensive pancreatic resection upon the young, growing individual. Although such a procedure does not result in the development of diabetes, the quantitative requirements for exocrine secretion during the phase of rapid growth have not been established. This experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of distal subtotal pancreatectomy on the growth and metabolism of young mice.. Material and Methods. Ninety C-3-H mice, each 4.

The study of graphs, or graph theory, is used in communications and information technology systems for various purposes. A graph refers to a collection of nodes (or vertices) and a collection of edges that connect pairs of nodes. A dominating set DS for a graph G is a set of nodes in G such that every node not in DS is joined to at least one member of DS by some edge. That is, each node in G is either a member of the dominating set DS or 1 hop away from a member node (may also be referred to as a dominating node). It is noted that a dominating set may include disjoint sets of nodes in the graph.
A connected dominating set (CDS) of a graph G includes a dominating set and a set of connecting nodes that may be needed to connect disjoint nodes in the dominating set. CDSs have traditionally been used in mobile ad-hoc networks for routing applications. For instance, broadcast and multicast protocols may efficiently reach all destinations by restricting transmissions to nodes that are members of the CDS (instead of every node in the graph). In addition to routing, mobile ad-hoc networks may benefit from CDSs in other areas including channel access, link adaptation, energy consumption, power control, dynamic resource management and the like.
Since a given graph may have more than one CDS, it may be beneficial to identify a CDS with minimum number of elements (e.g., nodes and/or edges). Such a CDS may be referred to as a minimum connected dominating set (MCDS). However, it has been shown that the computation complexity of minimum connected dominating set problem (MCDS), and minimum dominating set problem (MDS) in general, is NP-complete. Therein lies a need for a system and method capable of efficiently identifying a CDS with the number of elements as close to the minimum number as possible.

Characterization and technological properties of Staphylococcus xylosus strains isolated from a Tunisian traditional salted meat.
The technological properties of strains of Staphylococcus xylosus were studied to select the most suitable for use as starter cultures for the production of dried fermented meat products. Strains of S. xylosus were isolated from traditional salted Tunisian meat and were identified by biochemical and molecular methods. Thirty strains of S. xylosus were studied to evaluate their catalase, nitrate reductase, lipolytic, proteolytic and antibacterial activities as well as growth ability at different temperatures, pH's and NaCl concentrations. All strains of S. xylosus had catalase activity and were able to reduce nitrates to nitrites. The nitrate reductase activity increased when the strains were kept under anaerobic conditions. Proteolytic activity on milk and on gelatin agar was demonstrated for 100% and 83.3% of the S. xylosus isolates, respectively. However extracellular proteolytic activity as assessed by the azocasein method was poor in all the strains. Lipolytic activity as assessed by the agar method showed that 76.6% of strains of S. xylosus could hydrolyze Tween 20 against 33.3% that could hydrolyze tributyrin. Tween 80 was hydrolyzed by only 10% of strains. Strains of S. xylosus hydrolyzed pork fat better than beef and lamb fat. The majority of strains had antibacterial activity against Salmonella arizonae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis.

Mobility means synching up

If you’re an IT executive today, things pretty much work this way: so very often when you get a present from a family member, it’s the latest in mobile computing devices. In fact, most executives in this business are already carrying wireless handheld devices alongside a two-way pager and a cell phone.

Of course, I personally can’t wait to have my own version of a Dick Tracy watch, which means that just about anybody will be able to contact me whenever they take a notion to do so. But the fundamental problem with mobile computing is the need for such a concept – apart from existing IT services, that is.

To make matters worse, companies such as Verizon now are giving away free Internet-enabled phones to people willing to sign long-term contracts. L.M. Ericcson Telephone Co., meanwhile, is working with AT&T Corp. to create a new generation of wireless consumers by giving away wireless devices shaped like phones, allowing people to win prizes by interacting with the Who Wants to be a Millionaire television program.

The reason this represents such an immense problem for IT is that all these executives are sure they can’t live without such devices. Naturally, this means they want the devices connected to their work environments so that they can become ever more productive.

What most people don’t realize is that this presents a huge challenge for IT. Each mobile device on the market today comes with its own set of built-in services for e-mail and calendering. In order to integrate those services with existing corporate services built around Lotus Development Corp.’s Notes or Microsoft Corp.’s Exchange, IT organizations have to invest in synchronization software that can be purchased from more than a dozen different vendors today.

The problem is that every time one of the devices this software is intended to synchronize gets updated, the synchronization software needs to be updated. And of course anytime any of the core enterprise applications gets an upgrade, you’ll also need to update the synchronization software.

For IT people, this creates an infinite synchronization loop that diverts attention away from their real jobs: to make sure that their company has a working IT infrastructure. This loop exists because the concept of mobile computing has not yet sufficiently worked its way into our application development and Internet infrastructure psyche. Instead of having to purchase synchronization software to make the concept of mobile computing a reality, the technology needed to support mobile computing should be built directly into the applications we use and the services provided by ISPs.

Unfortunately, we’re a good two years away from seeing this approach become a reality, so in the meantime we can expect to see continued proliferation of mobile computing products that just add to the problem.

Alas, trying to put a lid on this phenomenon is roughly akin to the effort back in the 1980s of trying to stop the infiltration of PCs into corporate environments. The reality is that you can’t stop people when it comes to acquiring the latest gadget in an economy where people have far too much disposable income. And if you don’t try to support it, end-users will once again view the IT department as a behind-the-times bottleneck that prevents them from attaining data nirvana alongside their latest stock quotes.

So the best thing you can do for the moment is make a short-term investment in synchronization software because you will have some modicum of control. Nevertheless, IT organizations should also be putting a tremendous amount of pressure on ISVs and ISPs to create truly seamless mobile computing infrastructures.

After all, it’s in their interest to do so. Once we have such platforms, everybody can participate. Until then, mobile computing will just remain a troublesome niche application for those who can afford to pay for it.

The only question that remains is, how long are we going to have to live with mobile solutions that only take us part of the way there?

yorkshire pudding.. breakfast and dinner version..

i am a huge huge cheer's fan.. it's one of my all time favorite shows.. and one my favorite characters was cliff clavin, the under appreciated, hapless loser mail carrier.. one episode cliff explains yorkshire pudding to the cheer's gang here. and i have always remembered his "explanation" now i have since learned it was bogus but that was part of cliff's charm he made crap up and lead you to believe it was fact.. kind of like when i tell shell or jake "well you know i read on the internet... blah blah" and shell calls me out every time.. she says "MOM YOU CAN NOT QUOTE PEREZ HILTON as a legitimate source of facts.. {head hanging in shame} i can't help it.. he wouldn't put anything on his web site that wasn't true right?? right?? helloooooo **tapping on computer screen** right?? well enough with my gullibility.. when i was a kid, well 9th grade, i stayed my friend kathy's house all the time and we made this for breakfast every time!! we would sit with our warm "oven pancake" and smear jam on it and watch american bandstand.. {ok i don't know if we watched american bandstand we probably watched smurfs but hey i have an image to uphold here..} any way when my mom and i would go to lawry's prime rib house {i've mentioned before my fondness for that place} they always served with their prime rib a yorkshire pudding.. theirs were individual so they were more like a pop over, now i could have, i repeat, could have made individual ones, you see my mother in law gave me a pop over pan once.. {very nice of her huh} and well it was big and bulky and so i moved out to my cabinet in the garage.. if you've been reading this blog for any amount of time you have heard me tell my tales of woe about putting things in the garage.. pete donates them!! right out of my cabinet.. {he doesn't anymore because i threatened to clean out the garage one day and donate his crap..} so you guessed it.. he donated my pop over pan.. *sigh* so i had to make one big one.. nevertheless it was yummy and decadent and delicious.

preheat your oven to 425 degrees {f}... ladle your pan drippings from your roast into a large iron skillet {or put your butter in a large iron skillet} now add your "drippings/butter" to the oven to get hot ..just a few minutes.. meanwhile make your batter.. sift your flour and salt together.. add your eggs and milk and whisk until thoroughly combined.. add your pepper {don't add pepper if making for breakfast} and quickly incorporate.. remove drippings/butter from oven and pour batter right until the hot drippings/butter.. put in oven and cook for 12-15 minutes until puffy and lightly brown.. remove from oven and serve hot.. when serving for dinner i like to put my meat right on top of it.. when serving for breakfast i like to serve it with raspberry jam.. yummy!!!

kaotic kitchen

my little space on the net for recipes and thoughts... i should start off by saying I am not a blogger, this is, shall we say, a journal of sorts for my recipes and random thoughts now and again, to be shared with family and friends. my cooking philosophy is simple, if the recipe has too many ingredients I won't cook it, too many pots and pans required I won't do it, sandwiches DO NOT constitute dinner. I cook simple, quick and easy meals.

about me

I have had a love for cooking since I was young.. well ok at first it wasn't a love it was my "chore." but love came later.. When I turned 16 my Mother started me reading recipes on Sunday and then picking 2 or 3 from her cook books or magazines and then preparing a grocery list from the recipe (which today I am lost if I don't have my detailed list for my trip to the store) from my list I would then clip coupons and I would head off to the grocery store.. As an incintive (I always need incintives and money works wonders *smile*) I was allowed to keep any money I saved from the coupons and she would then pay me per meal I made. I had to cook at leaast 2 a week but if wanted more money I would cook more, the prices ranged from $5.00 for simple meals such as tacos and refried beans (no canned in my house) or $15.00 for something like Chicken Cacciatore (because it takes so much longer but is so much worth it). So when I got married and got a house of my own I was able to conquer the grocery store and cooking delicious meals. um thanks Mom?

What’s The Forecast On Kepler-7B? Hot And Cloudy

by

October 01, 201311:02 AM

Scientists are reasonably sure that it’s a cloudy day on , a planet that orbits its star about 1,000 light-years away from us.

Using NASA’s orbiting space telescopes, researchers publishing in say that for the first time they’ve been able to make a rudimentary map of the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet.

The team used faint visible light and infrared reflections from Kepler-7b to make their cloud map.

“By observing this planet with Spitzer and Kepler [telescopes] for more than three years, we were able to produce a very low-resolution ‘map’ of this giant, gaseous planet,” study co-author Brice-Olivier Demory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge said in a statement.

Governments love to blame international forces beyond their control for economic ills at home. Gordon Brown was a dab hand at this. But when a boom which involved a tripling of debt and house prices ends in a bust should we really be surprised? And could the governments of Spain and the UK not have stepped in to end the excesses long before their economies got addicted to debt? I think so and let us hope they don't let booms get carried away again although looking at both countries the next boom seems an awfully long way off.

The Indians have placed righty Corey Kluber on the 10-day DL with lower back discomfort, per a team announcement. He’ll be replaced for the time being by righty Joe Colon.

Kluber has reportedly been dealing with the back issue throughout the early portion of the season, so it seems the hope is that some rest will help him move past it. He has struggled somewhat thus far, perhaps due in part to the nagging discomfort.

Though Kluber is still carrying a strong 9.9 K/9 on the year, he has allowed more walks (3.1 BB/9) than usual and has coughed up seven long balls through 37 1/3 innings. His velocity has dropped a bit, with his four-seamer sitting at 91.5 mph and his sinker averaging 92.1 mph.

Literacy Notes
The 2013 Literacy Directors’ Retreat
Literacy directors from throughout
the state met to exchange ideas at
Oklahoma’s annual literacy directors’
retreat. For the second year in a row,
the retreat theme was inspired by an
old I Love Lucy television episode
featuring Lucy and Ethel working
in a chocolate factory. A morning
brainstorming session had directors
comparing new tutors to Lucy and
Ethel’s chocolate wrapping experi-ence.
What was the consensus? Unlike
Lucy and Ethel’s humorous work
practices, volunteer tutors are suc-cessful
when they receive adequate
training, on-going supervision, and
regular feedback. Interspersed be-tween
fun activities, program direc-tors
also discussed fund raising, adult
learner book clubs, health literacy,
and techniques to deal with stress.
The retreat was made possible thanks
to Library Services and Technology
Act funds from the Institute of Mu-seum
and Library Services.
[Left to right] Ida Fay Winters describes the health literacy project in Altus. • Rebecca Barker shares ideas on using high interest
reading materials. • Jana Smithey (Elk City) and other literacy directors try to balance a hula hoop during team building exercise.

Q:

What is the actual role of ZooKeeper in Kafka 2.1?

I have seen some similar questions as follows:
www.quora.com/What-is-the-actual-role-of-Zookeeper-in-Kafka-What-benefits-will-I-miss-out-on-if-I-don%E2%80%99t-use-Zookeeper-and-Kafka-together
Is Zookeeper a must for Kafka?
But I want to know the latest information about this question.
What is the actual role of ZooKeeper in Kafka 2.1?

A:

Zookeeper is required to run a Kafka Cluster.
It is used by Kafka brokers to perform elections (controller and topic leaders), to store topic metadata and various other things (ACLs, dynamic broker configs, quotas, Producer Ids)
Since Kafka 0.9, clients don't require access to Zookeeper, only brokers rely on it.

We need to keep America the world's greatest magnet for immigrants. Why? Today, more and more people around the globe have access to the same technological tools for innovation and entrepreneurship. In such a world, the countries that make it easy to draw in human talent will have a distinct advantage. Also, a steady flow of immigrants keeps a society flexible and competitive. The more open your society is to new people and ideas, the more things will be done by you, not to you. We shouldn't just welcome educated immigrants, but laborers as well. Immigrants keep energy flowing in America's veins. But because I strongly favor immigration, I also favor a high fenceif not a physical one, then at least a tamper-proof national I.D. card for every American, without which you could not get a legal job or access to government services. We will not sustain a majority in favor of flexible immigration if we can't control our borders. Good fences make good immigration policy.. Thomas L. Friedman [4/5/06]

Tin Top Bridge. Tin-Top Bridge. Hyde Hall, East Springfield, New York. This bridge was completed in 2011 and provides access to Hyde Hall from Tin Top through its Mill Road entrance. The existing culvert, which replaced the original bridge in the early 20th century, washed out in June 2006.

Pfizer announced that the final analysis results show its COVI-19 vaccine is 95% effective in preventing infections, even to elderly, and caused no serious side effects, the company said Wednesday.. The company is preparing to formally ask U.S. Food and Drug Administration to allow emergency use of the vaccine. The announcement came after as coronavirus cases in the US skyrocketed and other parts of the world, giving hopes for an end to the pandemic.. .. Earlier this week, competitor Moderna Inc. also announced 94.5% effectiveness of its own COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which is made with the same, brand-new technology — using a snippet of the genetic code of the coronavirus to train the body to recognize if the real virus comes along.

Sir,. Condoleeza Rice's statement on claims that the US has transported prisoners to be tortured in foreign states and in secret prison camps is the height of sophistry.. It sickens me that the US administration, which claims to lead the world in human rights, is quibbling over legalisms with far greater consequence than President Clinton's manoeuvres over oral sex with Monica Lewinsky.. Ms Rice claims that near-drowning of terrorist suspects, or the causing of pain near but not equivalent to organ failure, is not torture.. If our Prime Minister is to prevent any further damage to the UK's global reputation and safety against future terrorist attacks, he must utterly repudiate such claims.. Dr Ian Brown. London WC1

Monika Kořínková and Barbora Šimková debuted their first collaboration together with the 'Pierot Porcelain Tableware Collection.' The home accessory range evokes a sense of minimalism and tradition and consists of cups, saucers, bowls and vases.. In creating the set, the duo wanted to "bring back a certain culture of dining." The elegant tableware is meant to help people take a break from their busy lives through dining experiences. Also, a tradition of tableware aesthetics has also been diminishing, with less people investing in finer porcelain dishes.. The Pierot collection features a soft color palette with light gold accents. Some of the pieces were achieved through the act of recycling old shapes of tableware -- inspired by porcelain decor and vintage cut glass.. Eccentric Porcelain Dishware. Score.

Don?. Hi, I think it is very refreshing that you have decided to keep some of your precious life private. I myself am in the process of writing lifestyle blogs and launching a new babywear product and as a naturally private person was also contemplating how much of my life I would need to disclose in order to be a successful blogger. I know that part of blogging means opening up and sharing parts of your life with the world so that they can relate with you, however I also believe there needs to be a balance between being able to capture and experience personal moments that only you and your family share with moments that will inspire or positively influence someone else out there in the wide world! Good luck with your new parenting life and business ventures. 😊

"Let’s be honest here – we love to snack as much as anyone. Why else would we start our own snack company? One bite will have you saying MMM-MMM. And when you discover they are also heart-healthy, you might say HMMMMM? Good for you AND tasty? How did they do that?

For starters, all of our chips are made with plant sterols and have been proven to lower cholesterol. We use only heart-healthy oils, plus other great ingredients like whole oats and whole grains (our tortilla chips) and a frying process that helps our potato chips have 40% less fat than regular potato chips.

Now doing something good for your heart is as easy as opening a bag of Corazonas heart-healthy chips!"

Equestrian lessons. Dressage is the execution, by a trained horse, of precision movements in response to barely perceptible signals from its rider. Dressage harmoniously develops the physique and ability of both the horse and rider.. Cleland’s equestrian lessons are for riders from beginner to advanced level who are aspiring to ride competitively and become world-class dressage or show-jumping equestrians. These lessons are intensive and are aimed towards riders who have already undertaken or would like to begin equestrianism as an athletic sport.. Our equestrian lessons are coached by FEI Level 2 Coach and FEI World Dressage Final Silver and Bronze Medalist Akoele Roachford. Akoele was trained in both dressage and showjumping in Germany. She has trained many students to a level where they were able to acquire full and partial equestrian scholarships to universities in the USA.. All Equestrian lessons are private lessons, lasting between 45 minutes to 1 hour, and will be scheduled to your convenience.

Democracy and Economic Growth. Date2012-05-23. Author. Uslu, Hakan. Type of Degreethesis. DepartmentEconomics. MetadataShow full item record. Abstract. A common theorem of political economists is that democracy and income are strongly correlated. There are conflicting views on the direction of the causality. Coups that started due to non- economic reasons are shocks to democracy. I use such coups to test the hypothesis that democracy causes high economic development. My results suggest that anti-democratic coups have a significant negative effect on economic development. On the other hand, democracy has a strong positive effect on economic development. This study focuses on how an anti-democratic change in regime influences the income level in a country.. Files. - Name:. - thesis_final_21May2012.pdf. - Size:. - 480.4Kb

About Scott Walker. Scott Walker is the 45th and current Governor of Wisconsin. He also served in the Wisconsin State Assembly and as the Milwaukee County Executive. He was recently elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association. First elected governor in the 2010 Wisconsin general election and was reelected governor in the 2014 Wisconsin gubernatorial election. The response to Walker’s policies included protests at the Wisconsin State Capitol and an effort to recall Walker. Walker introduced a budget plan which limited the collective bargaining of most Wisconsin public employees. Walker survived the 2012 recall election, becoming the first American governor to survive a recall effort. Walker was a candidate for his party’s nomination to the 2016 presidential election but left early in the contest..

If it matters, as a customer /user, I'd rather forego all my data on their

than have Garmin pay the ransom.

According to this TC article, it's basically illegal for a company to pay the
ransom:

The village is served by Poppleton railway station on the Harrogate Line. According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 1,961, increasing to 1,997 at the 2011 Census.  Before 1996, it was part of the Borough of Harrogate.

The name is derived from popel (pebble) and tun (hamlet, farm) and means "Pebble Farm" because of the gravel bed upon which the village was built. Upper Poppleton has been referred to as "Land Poppleton" and the neighbouring village of Nether Poppleton as "Water Poppleton" indicating their position relative to the river.

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles. It became a Conservation Area in 1993.

History
In 972, the village was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles as "Popeltun" and in the Domesday Book as "Popeltune". The villages and lands were given by Osbert De Arches to the Abbot of St Mary's in York. It was, therefore, under the ecclesiastical rule of the Parish of St Mary-Bishophill Junior.

During the reign of Richard II the village was the scene of the murder of a Mayor of York.

In 1644 the 25,000 strong Scottish and Parliament Armies, led by the Earl of Manchester, laid siege to the city of York. To facilitate communications, they built a "Bridge of Boats" at Poppleton. This bridge was eventually taken by Prince Rupert and his Royalist Forces, but he subsequently lost the battle at Marston Moor.

The village benefitted from the growth in the railways in the 19th century, when the York, Knaresborough and Harrogate Railway routed their line through Poppleton and erected a station.

Governance
Upper Poppleton lies within the Rural West Ward of the City of York Unitary Authority. As of the 2011 elections it is represented by Councillors Ian Gillies, Paul Healey and Chris Steward who are all members of the local Conservative Party. It is also a part of the UK Parliamentary Constituency of York Outer as well as the EU region of Yorkshire and the Humber.

Locally there is a Parish Council with eight council members.

Economy
The Poppletons were formerly agricultural settlements with many farms, but the modern village is mostly a dormitory for commuters to the nearby towns and cities. It has benefited from its good road and rail links. The village has local retail facilities, including a Post Office, and some small enterprises.

Demography
In the 19th century the population has varied between 284 and 346. The census of 2001 recorded the population as 1,961.

Community
There are two allotment sites in the village of Upper Poppleton. One is located at the end of Beech Grove and the other is in Main Street next to the Library. There are eight allotments on the Beech Grove Allotments, each approximately 300 square metres. The land is owned by the Parish Council. Main Street Allotments have seven plots.

There is a Youth Club and Scout Troop in the village.

Education
In 1797, local ironmonger John Dodsworth founded a Church of England School. This was converted into accommodation for the School Master when a new building was built in 1850. As of 2010 Poppleton Ousebank Primary provides primary education for both Poppletons.

For secondary education, the village is in the catchment area of York High School on Cornlands Road in nearby Acomb, though the nearest secondary school is Manor CE on Millfield Lane. Manor is a Church of England School and has its own admissions policy separate from the local City Council. It was originally built in 1813 at Kings Manor and has moved several times before being sited in Millfield Lane.

Transport

Harrogate Coach Travel buses run past the village as part of the York to Ripon route.

First York buses operate in the village as part of the Nether Poppleton route to York/Stamford Bridge. Transdev York buses operate in the village, as part of the Nether Poppleton route to York/Stamford Bridge, As well as through the village, as part of the Askham Bar/Acomb to Clifton Moor/Monks Cross/University route. Eddie Brown buses run past the village as part of the York to Boroughbridge/Ripon route.

A Park and Ride (Poppleton Bar) was constructed by the A59 in 2015, with Park and Ride buses (route 59) running from Poppleton to York centre, generally every ten minutes.

Northern Rail operates a stopping service on the line between York and Leeds via Harrogate. Poppleton station is the first station after York.

Religion

The old Norman 'Chapel of All Hallows' in Upper Poppleton was demolished in 1890 to make way for the Victorian Church of All Saints. The 'new' church was designed by Hodgson Fowler of Durham.

In 1866, the two Poppleton Parishes were united to form the Parish of Nether Poppleton with Upper Poppleton. All Saints' Church is situated on The Green in Upper Poppleton.

The present Methodist Chapel on the Green replaced two previous buildings on the site built in 1817 and 1819 respectively.

Sports
Poppleton United 1st XI play in York Football League Premier Division, as of 2010, and play next to the Community Centre on Main Street. The 2nd XI play in Reserve Division C. Poppleton Tigers Junior Football Club is located in Nether Poppleton, but serves both villages.

There is a Lawn Tennis Club with artificial and all weather courts in Main Street. As of 2010 the Men's 1st and second team play in Division One of the Tyke Petroleum Tennis League and the 3rd team play in Division Six. The Ladies 1st team also compete in the Ladies section of the same League, with the 1st team playing in Division One, the 2nd team in Division Three and the 3rd team in Division Three as of 2010. They also enter five teams in the Mixed Section in Divisions One, Two, Six Eight and Eleven.

Orienteering in Tilgate Forest. Published on 05/02/20. Despite the squelchy and swamp-like conditions at the regional orienteering event in Tilgate Forest, the two members of the Claremont Fan Court School orienteering squad made the journey to Crawley and completed their courses in impressive fashion.. On the 2.7 km orange course, Thomas F navigated steadily, with no significant errors, and was very pleased to finish in 49:53 for 8th place. Ellis B, on his first outing this year, sped round the 2 km yellow course to finish in first place in the excellent time of 21:35. After his best result so far, Ellis is looking forward to moving up to the orange course at Ashdown Forest.

State leaders continue to rail against federal tax plan

The tax overhaul plan proposed by President Donald Trump and now being considered in Congress would end the deduction on federal income tax forms for state and local property taxes. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said it would disproportionately harm New Yorkers, where property taxes are among the highest in the nation, and he’s taken opportunities at recent public events to make the case against the plan.

WBFO Albany Correspondent Karen DeWitt reports.

Cuomo called the plan unfair “double taxation.” If New Yorkers are not allowed to deduct their state and local taxes, they essentially would be taxed twice – once by state and local governments and again by the federal government on earnings that they already paid in the form of taxes to the state and local governments. He estimated it would cost New York $17.5 billion a year.

“This is like upside-down world,” Cuomo said on Oct. 5 on Long Island. “It’s called a tax cut plan. It’s really a tax increase for most New Yorkers.”

Cuomo predicted that getting rid of the deduction also would ruin the state’s business climate, which is already struggling in some regions.

“It is an attempt by the federal government, purposeful or coincidental, to make New York and several states actually less competitive for businesses,” Cuomo said on Oct. 3 in New York City.

The governor is not alone in his opposition. Fellow Democrats, including State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, also are worried. DiNapoli said recently that he’s “very concerned” about the effects of eliminating the deduction.

“For a high-tax state like New York, state and local tax deductibility has been a very important component of the federal tax code,” said DiNapoli, who added that even with a proposed higher standard deduction, it’s still not a “win” for New York taxpayers.

DiNapoli and Cuomo have conducted separate studies showing that New Yorkers give over $40 billion more in taxes to the federal government than the state gets back, an imbalance that has doubled in recent years.

U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is New York’s senior senator and the Senate minority leader, said it’s not just New Yorkers who will be adversely affected. Schumer said one-third of total taxpayers in the United States, or about 44 million, currently take the state and local tax deductions. He recently released data showing that people in states like Georgia, a Republican stronghold, and Colorado also would be affected.

“The effect of removing state and local deductibility is deep and wide,” Schumer said. “And I think it’s going to alone kill the Republican plan as it is.”

Schumer predicted that the elimination of the deduction eventually will be dropped from the plan. He said he was involved in the last successful tax overhaul in the 1980s. He said the deduction was ultimately kept in the plan because it would have adversely affected too many lawmakers’ constituents.

Several Republican congressmen and women in New York already have said they are against getting rid of the state and local property tax deductions, including John Faso of the Hudson Valley and Peter King of Staten Island. Seven GOP members, including Claudia Tenney and John Katko, both of central New York, and Elise Stefanik of the North Country, wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, asking him to reconsider.

Cuomo said if the final plan includes the elimination of the deduction, he’ll go to court to stop it.

True molecular solutions of natural cellulose in the binary ionic liquid-containing solvent mixtures.
Evidence is presented for the first time of true molecular dissolution of cellulose in binary mixtures of common polar organic solvents with ionic liquid. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, small-angle neutron-, X-ray- and static light scattering were used to investigate the structure of cellulose solutions in mixture of dimethyl formamide and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. Structural information on the dissolved chains (average molecular weight ∼ 5 × 10(4)g/mol; gyration radius ∼ 36 nm, persistence length ∼ 4.5 nm), indicate the absence of significant aggregation of the dissolved chains and the calculated value of the second virial coefficient ∼ 2.45 × 10(-2)mol ml/g(2) indicates that this solvent system is a good solvent for cellulose. More facile dissolution of cellulose could be achieved in solvent mixtures that exhibit the highest electrical conductivity. Highly concentrated cellulose solution in pure ionic liquid (27 wt.%) prepared according to novel method, utilizing the rapid evaporation of a volatile co-solvent in binary solvent mixtures at superheated conditions, shows insignificant cellulose molecular aggregation.

Employers cannot force employees to retire at 65 without a clear justification in each case after a ruling by the UK’s Supreme Court yesterday.. Five justices ruled that Leslie Seldon, a partner in a Kent firm, had not been treated unfairly when compulsorily retired at 65. But they sent his case back to the employment tribunal to consider whether the mandatory age of 65, in the circumstances of the law firm, was a “proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aims of the partnership”.. The ruling sets out new guidance for firms and companies, making clear they can force employees to

Q:

Is there a tool for windows that creates formula-pictures out of a text-formula

I am looking for a tool that would batch process text-files containing formulas (possibly latex style) and convert them into a gif/png/jpg. Since I want to do a batch conversion, the tool ideally runs in cmd.exe.
What I need is probably possible with a latex installation (MiKTeX comes to mind), but if not absolutely necessary, I don't want to install 100MB+ for my need.
Is there such a tool?

A:

The "best" solution for quality is to use a full LaTeX installation, and then generate images via command line with e.g. mathTeX.
From my answer to a similar (but not duplicate, imho) question here at Super User:

MathTeX, licensed under the gpl, is a cgi program that lets you easily embed LaTeX math in your own html pages, blogs, wikis, etc. It parses a LaTeX math expression and immediately emits the corresponding gif (or png) image, rather than the usual TeX dvi. So just place an html  tag in your document wherever you want to see the corresponding LaTeX expression.

It can either be used as a CGI script on the server and linked directly from the <img> tag, or run on the command-line to generate standalone image files. From the homepage:

mathTeX is usually run by your web server as a cgi program, obtaining its input expression from the query-string of an html  tag. But you can also run mathTeX from your Unix shell, supplying all input on the command line. For example, ./mathtex.cgi "x^2+y^2" –o equation1   renders an image of x^2+y^2 in file equation1.gif.

There is actually a related project called mimeTeX that sounds more or less exactly like what you want, even though the quality is said to not be as good as with a full LaTeX installation solution as mathTeX uses, and it can naturally not handle all LaTeX cases without a LaTeX installation.
Like mathTeX, it is made primarily with webservers in mind, but in the same way, it can be run from the command line. You don't specify OS, which often indicates Windows, and compilation instructions for Windows are available on the project page linked earlier.

EDIT: I noted that the mimeTeX page provides pre-compiled binaries for Windows as well, under §5.1. Just download that and follow the instructions, as any regular Windows program. If you are on e.g. Debian or Ubuntu, both mimeTeX and mathTeX are part of the main repository.

What's the best way to laying out a brochure (trifold) 8.5" x 11" using InDesign?. Where is your problem? Why not start to work?. A trifold needs to have the fold-in panel slightly smaller in width than the other 2 panels. The paper thickness determines the appropriate panel size, but for general purposes, 1/16 inch smaller for the fold-in should suffix.. For referencing the pages of a trifold, use this numbering scheme: front 5-6-1 and back 2-3-4.. You can lay this out with two 11 x 8.5 pages OR 6 single pages arranged in a group of 1-2-3 and 4-5-6. Using the 6 single page method requires a version of Indesign that allows modifying page sizes. NOTE: you can set up 3 equal size panels, but this can create a folding issue.. To achieve the 1/16 inch smaller panel, create guides/pages with the following widths: [front 3.625 - 3.6875 - 3.6875] and [back 3.6875 - 3.6875 - 3.625]

.. As a result of Mkhitaryan’s aforementioned demands, Thomas Tuchel’s side would have to sell him this summer itself in order to avoid losing him for free next year. And because of that, Arsenal now have the chance of signing the player for a bargain price of just £20m!. Mkhitaryan, who is widely regarded as one of the most technically gifted players of his position, in Europe, was in scintillating form for his club last season during the course of which he scored 23 goals and provided 32 assists in 52 appearances. He may prove to be a massively useful signing for the Gunners, going by his capability to play as a winger and an attacking midfielder and the amount of big stage experience that he possesses, and may complement the likes of Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez pretty well.

Zinc(II) complexes of the second-generation quinolone antibacterial drug enrofloxacin: Structure and DNA or albumin interaction.
Zinc mononuclear complexes with the second-generation quinolone antibacterial drug enrofloxacin in the absence or presence of a nitrogen donor heterocyclic ligand 1,10-phenanthroline or 2,2'-bipyridine have been synthesized and characterized. Enrofloxacin is on deprotonated mode acting as a bidentate ligand coordinated to zinc ion through the ketone and a carboxylato oxygen atoms. The crystal structure of bis(enrofloxacinato)(1,10-phenanthroline)zinc(II), 2, has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The biological activity of the complexes has been evaluated by examining their ability to bind to calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) with UV and fluorescence spectroscopies. UV studies of the interaction of the complexes with DNA have shown that they can bind to CT DNA and the DNA binding constants have been calculated. Competitive studies with ethidium bromide (EB) have shown that the complexes exhibit the ability to displace the DNA-bound EB indicating that they bind to DNA in strong competition with EB for the intercalative binding site. The complexes exhibit good binding propensity to human and bovine serum albumin proteins having relatively high binding constant values.

Rapid response to budesonide (Pulmicort) inhaled via the Nebuhaler in asthmatic children.
Acute reversible airways obstruction in children, especially those aged under one year, who may respond poorly to inhaled beta 2-stimulants, is difficult to treat in general practice. In an open study, 48 episodes in 29 children, half aged under one year, were treated with budesonide (Pulmicort) 0.1-2.09 mg used to charge a Nebuhaler fitted with a facemask. In 45 instances, clinical improvement was observed, and with doses of 0.8 mg and above, this usually occurred within 10 minutes. This study suggests that budesonide via a suitable delivery system can evoke rapid improvement in reversible airways obstruction in young children.

Q:

How to Extract people's last name start with "S" and first name not start with "S"

As the title shows, how do I capture a person who:

Last name start with letter "S"
First name NOT start with letter "S"

The expression should match the entire last name, not just the first letter, and first name should NOT be matched.
Input string is like the following:

(Last name) (First name)
Duncan, Jean
Schmidt, Paul
Sells, Simon
Martin, Jane
Smith, Peter
Stephens, Sheila

This is my regular expression:
/([S].+)(?:, [^S])/

Here is the result I have got:

Schmidt, P
Smith, P

the result included "," space & letter "P" which should be excluded.
The ideal match would be

Schmidt
Smith

A:

You can try this pattern: ^S\w+(?=, [A-RT-Z]).
^S\w+ matches any word (name in your case) that start with S at the beginning,
(?=, [A-RT-Z]) - positive lookahead - makes sure that what follows, is not the word (first name in your case) starting with S ([A-RT-Z] includes all caps except S).

The primary field of application for this invention is guidance of unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles. In such applications it is common practice to compute a guidance command that results in a rate of turn that depends on a measurement of heading error. Both the measurement and the command are with respect to an inertial coordinate frame of reference. The guidance command is received and acted upon by a system (commonly referred to as an autopilot or stability augmentation system), which in turn sends commands to the vehicles servos and/or reaction control devices. This results in a movement of the vehicle's control surfaces, or vectors the thrust produced by the vehicle's propulsion system, or turns on-and-off a reaction control system, or a combination of such means of vehicle control. However vehicles respond to servo command relative to the medium through which they move, and when that medium is also in motion, then the rate of turn that is achieved depends nonlinearly on the speed and direction of the medium through which the vehicle is moving. This dependence can result in degraded or even unstable responses to the guidance system command, particularly for vehicles whose speed relative to the medium is not far greater than the speed of the medium itself (e.g. guided parafoils and underwater vehicles).
One approach to this problem is to sense the vector motion of the vehicle relative to the medium through which it is moving as well as its inertial velocity vector. By differencing these two quantities, one can compute the inertial velocity of the medium and provide a correction to the guidance command for that motion. However this requires incorporating devices that sense the vehicle's vector relative motion, which are not normally a part of the existing guidance and control system design. Such sensors in an aircraft are often referred to as an air data system.

Deep brain stimulation of globus pallidus internus in a 16-year-old boy with severe tourette syndrome and mental retardation.
A 16- year-old boy with long-standing severe Tourette syndrome (TS) and mental retardation, non-responsive to complex pharmocological and behavioural treatment was selected for bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Pre-operative and post-operative Yale Tourette syndrome scale (YTSS) scores and several other scores were used to quantify the effect of DBS up to one year follow-up. Although subscores of the YTSS improved, the overall outcome of chronic GPi-DBS showed no substantial therapeutic effect. This finding is in contrast to markedly improved TS of the only two adolescent TS patients in whom DBS has been performed so far. In this article we discuss possible reasons for the poor therapeutic effect of GPi-DBS in our patient contributing to the on-going debate on DBS inclusion criteria for adolescent TS patients.

For a long time, simply proving the existence of exoplanets was a big deal. We had over a hundred years of fiction and even non-fiction based on the assumption that our universe is absolutely packed with alien planets — but we simply couldn’t prove that they existed. Now, with the list of planets outside our solar system ballooning by dozens or more at a time, the stakes are quite a bit higher. Simply finding and identifying exoplanets is no longer enough to impress, and now you have to actually learn something about them. That’s been the goal of a team from MIT, which this week publishes a piece detailing their pioneering new method for looking at alien weather.

That’s much easier said than done, however, for many of the same reasons that it took so long to confirm the existence of exoplanets in the first place: they are very small and very dark. Most exoplanets have been confirmed thanks to so-called “transit” in front of their parent star, producing a blown-own planetary silhouette. Astronomers have worked to pull much more useful data from these transits than simple size and speed, and this MIT paper represents a major step toward that goal. By looking at the fluctuations in any light spilling around the edges of an alien world, these researchers can gain some insight into its atmosphere. Particularly, the team can derive some real information about the clouds that sit on top of this atmosphere.

The technique starts with a climate model that uses predicted pressure values to predict how different substances will behave on the surface of a given planet. This gives the team a mixture of gaseous products to model, and the software then looks at how these gasses might interact on the surface of an alien world with particular properties. The software spits out a prediction for the spectrographic readings we’d expect to be associated with each of these possible cloud formations. After that, all they need to do is compare their actual readings to the list of predictions — if any of the values fits observation too well to be coincidence, that’s probably our culprit.

The team used Kepler 7b as a test bed for its technique, and their readings suggest that the planet has clouds made of vaporized rock. On Earth these substances would be solid, or at most liquid near the planet’s interior. However Kepler 7b is absolutely gargantuan (one reason it was one of the first five confirmed exoplanets) and orbits less than a twentieth of as far from its star as the Earth does from Sol; sometimes referred to as a “hot Jupiter,” Kepler is a nightmarish furnace to make Venus look hospitable.

NASA’s TESS mission could make even these findings look tame.

These incredible rock-clouds are just another bullet point on the list of reasons exoplanetologists have the coolest scientific conferences. Their results often read like the ramblings of a science fiction author, narrating a magellan-like voyage through a universe far too surreal to ever actually exist. Worlds have been shown to rain diamond, or simply to be composed almost entirely of it. Others have multiple sunsets or abnormally long or short years. Astronomers have found planets that are several times older than our Sun, and others that are younger than our upright ancestors. The search for alien planets is the search for the edges of what’s possible, and techniques like this one are proving that we are very far from finding them.

While Kepler was mankind’s first tailored planet hunter, NASA is already well underway on its successor: the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. TESS should take our understanding of exoplanets to a new level, and unlike many areas of astronomy, in this case the tinier the detail of the observation the more relatable it is to the average person. It’s hard to imagine a super-Jupiter, but easier to imagine clouds. Exoplanetology will almost certainly be one of the most publicly lauded areas of astronomy in years to come.

Guanethidine-induced adrenergic sympathectomy augments endoneurial perfusion and lowers endoneurial microvascular resistance.
Chronic administration of guanethidine sulfate in the rat induces a selective adrenergic neuropathy. We studied the effects of guanethidine-induced adrenergic sympathectomy on rat sciatic nerve blood flow (NBF), microvascular resistance (MR), vessel caliber and norepinephrine (NE) content. A control group of animals was studied following chronic administration of mammalian Ringer's solution. NBF and MR were measured with an endoneurial microelectrode, using the technique of hydrogen clearance (HC). Following HC, the sciatic nerve was perfused with India Ink, removed, frozen and sectioned. Measurements were made of endoneurial microvessel numbers, diameter, circumference and area. The contralateral sciatic nerve was removed for measurements of NE content. In guanethidine-treated animals we observed elevated NBF, reduced MR and dilated microvessels. Numbers of microvessels and fascicular areas were similar to controls. NE content was markedly reduced following sympathectomy. These studies suggest that NBF, unlike cerebral blood flow (CBF), is regulated by its adrenergic input. Removal of adrenergic innervation of the vasa nervorum appears to result in a loss of tonic vasoconstrictive action.

Lapis Lazuli Mens Rings. Add-ons have become favored by both men and women, the factors why they choose all of them are very different. Ladies would you like to look great as well as want their outfits becoming completed because of the jewellery they wear. Using this into consideration, a woman will usually use the proper earrings, necklaces or bracelets in line with the garments she has opted for.. Men conversely don’t have equivalent factors because the ladies. They could in addition look at the advantages they will have so far as the appearance are worried, however they are additionally into showing their energy and status. Regardless of what they might be using or even for exactly what occasion, males whom like using jewellery will do therefore simply because they would also like to deliver an email.

Along with the cost of transportation, it is of extreme importance to take into account the factors like risk while driving, the wear and tear of the road, bad weather condition and many more. All these factors have a direct impact on the safety of your car. So make sure that you have hired experienced and licensed transportation service like provided by auto shipping Danbury team. Going forward with such team can give you enormous benefits and can end up with the worth hiring service.

I'm using a knoppix live cd (recommended by uni) to compile and run c programs off a usb drive - practice makes perfect. I get compile error messages when not done properly, warning messages, etc which is good. But when I try to run the program nothing happens. So for example, to compile test.c (which displays a simple printf statement), I would type:. $ gcc -o test test.c. Then to run the program, I type:. $ test. And nothing happens. It just goes to the next line, ready to take in another command. Why?

Development Strategy and Feasibility Study of Income Generation Projects in Machakhela National Parks. Commissioned by UNDP, the Goal of the project was to identify potential income generation projects for Machakhela National Park and prepare technical and economic feasibility analysis regarding the selected projects, evaluate the risks associated with the implementation of the projects in terms of their impact on environment and biodiversity and provide relevant risk mitigation strategy. Except that, the impact assessment of new road to Chakvistavi village on Mtirala National Park was included as the part of the project. The main purpose of the impact assessment was to identify actions to maximize benefits for the NP and mitigate potential negative impacts caused by increased number of visitors due to improved access.

Regardless of the amount by which personal lending increases, what is important is the availability of help for those who get themselves into difficulty, and we may see an increase in the number of people in difficulty if interest rates rise towards the end of the year. I know that that would cause pain to a great many of our constituents, so it is important to get the system right now.

With a supportive FCA framework already in place, a fairly minor amendment to the Bill could effectively set a fee structure that would activate the provision of free debt management plans by authorised firms. I hope that my Front-Bench colleagues agree that action is needed soon, and that the Bill represents a timely vehicle for the necessary change.

I believe this to be a truly cross-party issue, and that the Bill needs to be amended to give people in debt more security and access to free, high-quality plans that help them to manage their finances. If interest rates do go up any time soon, the debt management sector may be called on to give even more support than it provides now, and this is therefore a good time to strengthen the system.

Establishment of a turkey cecal cell line and development of turkey coccidia within the cells.
Cells were dispersed from cecal tissues of 1- to 2-day-old turkeys using a mixture of collagenase and dispase to enrich for epithelial cells. The initial culture produced from these cells (TCC) appeared to be heterogeneous, but, as the cells were cultured through 25 passages, they assumed a more fibroblastic appearance. Cellular invasion of the TCC by two species of turkey coccidia, Eimeria adenoeides and Eimeria meleagrimitis, was not enhanced, as compared with invasion in turkey kidney cells (TKC), the cell culture system standardly used to study the avian coccidia in vitro. However, early development by one of the species, E. meleagrimitis, was markedly increased in the TCC (Passages 6 through 19) over that in TKC. Thirty to 42% of the parasites that invaded the TCC developed beyond the sporozoite stage, as compared with 5% development in TKC. Mature first-generation schizonts were observed within 24 hr postinoculation in the TCC, but not until 48 hr in the kidney cells. There was no evidence that development of the second generation was initiated in either the TCC or kidney cells.

Five years ago, Bruce R. Spector was a partner in a little Washington cable TV company when he thought he saw the future. And for all the breathless whiz-bang hype of the Information Age, it wasn't cable.. Humble as it seemed -- and as pitiful a financial shape as it was in after a series of failed or struggling leveraged buyouts -- Spector and partner Joseph L. Mathias IV decided the future was radio. Based on that insight, they launched Benchmark Communications, a Baltimore company they hope to take public later this year, one that an industry peer says could be worth up to $160 million.. Benchmark has been on an acquisition spree since Congress approved the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which let companies such as Benchmark own many more stations in the same radio markets. This month alone, it has bought six stations to bring its total to 33, all in the southeastern United States, in small cities where the company can avoid such giant players as Westinghouse Electric Corp.

When I first started diving, I experienced quite a bit of motion sickness. It would never be a problem before a dive, but it would be a real problem upon surfacing. I would feel nauseaus at the surface and on the boat, and the feeling would slowly fade once back on land.. I learned a few tricks to minimize motion sickness. Medication probably helped the most, but I also ate better and drank more water. I also chugged a special soda immediately before diving; the soda contains an acid that counters motion sickness.. Over time, I noticed that my motion sickness decreased. I would dive unprepared, which is to say I hadn’t taken the medication or drank the soda, but I would feel relatively well after the dive.. I still take all precautions before a dive, just in case. However, it seems that the body adapts and naturally becomes less susceptible to motion sickness over time.. Good tips for combating motion sickness while diving!

Health Care In The Suburbs: An Analysis Of Suburban Poverty And Health Care Access.
There are 16.9 million Americans living in poverty in the suburbs-more than in cities or rural communities. Despite recent increases in suburban poverty, the perception of the suburbs as areas of uniform affluence remains, and there has been little research into health care barriers experienced by people living in these areas. The objectives of this study were to compare patterns of insurance coverage and health care access in suburban, urban, and rural areas using national survey data from 2005 to 2015 and to compare outcomes by geography before and after the Affordable Care Act took effect. We found that nearly 40 percent of the uninsured population lived in suburban areas. Though unadjusted rates of health care access were better in suburban areas, compared to urban and rural communities, this advantage was greatly reduced after income and other demographics are accounted for. Overall, a substantial portion of the US population residing in the suburbs lacked health insurance and experienced difficulties accessing care. Increased policy attention is needed to address these challenges for vulnerable populations living in the suburbs.

Title III Ruling to Effect Real Estate Market? 3 Experts Weigh In

Friday marked a big win for entrepreneurs and the everyday consumer when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted 3-1 for the next step in equity crowd funding. The approval of Title III of the JOBS Act is a long-awaited ruling that has both experts and consumers talking about the impact it will have on our country's economy—and the real estate market.

Once the ruling goes into effect, companies can be financed by anyone with the cash to opt in, without undergoing the public registration process. This is a huge move, as it's the first time in the history of the SEC (that's 82 years!) that retail investors---otherwise known as your everyday joe--will be able to invest in private businesses.

So how will this impact the real estate market? Below, three industry experts weigh in on what the ruling will mean for our economy, and the $2.5 billion real estate crowdfunding industry.

Scott Picken, author of Property Going Global and CEO and founder of Wealth Migrate, the 10th largest global real estate crowdfunding platform.“I don’t believe there is going to be a catalytic change overnight, but this will have a catalytic affect in the long term. The bottom line is that the wealth gap, the difference between the have’s and the have not’s, is the greatest challenge we have on the planet, and it is only getting worse. Now with technology and this change in legislation, the bottom 99 percent will have the same access to the same opportunities and partners as the top 1 percent. What most people don’t understand is that this will have a big impact in America, but a far greater impact in the emerging world. This is going to change the real estate industry forever and also put a case forward to a global change in legislation.”Marshall Saunders, co-founder and managing partner of SaundersDailey, a real estate crowdfunding platform connecting investors to residential real estate opportunities in select markets throughout the Midwest.“[The ruling] is not as wide open and accepting of non-accredited investors as I had hoped for. But it's a start. We will make the best out of the rules and will consider it a toe in the door. With good results, and consumer demand, we will see that door opening wider and wider in the coming years. The bottom line is that non-accredited investors now have a way of participating in equity crowdfunding. It will change the way America invests, both in business startups and real estate. The wait has been hard, but understandable. The U.S. Congress has no idea the magnitude of what it was dumping on the SEC when it passed the JOBS Act in 2012. Given that fact, the SEC has done the best that they can to move this forward.”

“Title III was never intended to have a competitive impact on the established markets. By design it's intended to enable entrepreneurs and real estate sponsors that have had difficulty raising much-needed capital from traditional channels to be able to do so more efficiently from individual investors, which is precisely what it will facilitate and make a meaningful impact on for those that access this new ecosystem.”

Only time will tell exactly how Title III will impact real estate, but it seems as if times are changing, 3-1.

The VSG expression sites of Trypanosoma brucei: multipurpose tools for the adaptation of the parasite to mammalian hosts.
The variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes of Trypanosoma brucei are transcribed in telomeric loci termed VSG expression sites (ESs). Despite permanent initiation of transcription in most if not all of these multiple loci, RNA elongation is abortive except in bloodstream forms where full transcription up to the VSG occurs only in a single ES at a time. The ESs active in bloodstream forms are polycistronic and contain several genes in addition to the VSG, named ES-associated genes (ESAGs). So far 12 ESAGs have been identified, some of which are present only in some ESs. Most of these genes encode surface proteins and this list includes different glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins such as the heterodimeric receptor for the host transferrin (ESAG7/6), integral membrane proteins such as the receptor-like transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (ESAG4) and a surface transporter (ESAG10). An interesting exception is ESAG8, which may encode a cell cycle regulator involved in the differentiation of long slender into short stumpy bloodstream forms. Several ESAGs belong to multigene families including pseudogenes and members transcribed out of the ESs, named genes related to ESAGs (GRESAGs). However, some ESAGs (7, 6 and 8) appear to be restricted to the ESs. Most of these genes can be deleted from the active ES without apparently affecting the phenotype of bloodstream form trypanosomes, probably either due to the expression of ESAGs from 'inactive' ESs (ESAG7/6) or due to the expression of GRESAGs (in particular, GRESAGs4 and GRESAGs1). At least three ESAGs (ESAG7, ESAG6 and SRA) share the evolutionary origin of VSGs. The presence of these latter genes in ESs may confer an increased capacity of the parasite for adaptation to various mammalian hosts, as suggested in the case of ESAG7/6 and proven for SRA, which allows T. brucei to infect humans. Similarly, the existence of a collection of slightly different ESAG4s in the multiple ESs might provide the parasite with adenylyl cyclase isoforms that may regulate growth in response to different environmental conditions. The high transcription rate and high recombination level that prevail in VSG ESs may have favored the generation and/or recruitment in these sites of genes whose hyper-evolution allows adaptation to a larger variety of hosts.

These golf shoes are clearly geared towards the younger crowd and why not with a young upstart golfer in Rickie Fowler as their spokesman, Puma clearly knows the direction they're going in. So would I, a 42 year old hacker, father of 3 be able to rock these pastel head turners. Read on!

Features
Last year I had the opportunity to review some Puma Tipper Golf Shoes and was thoroughly impressed with the technology used in the shoes to make them so lightweight yet so sturdy for all kinds of golfing conditions. This Special Edition Cell Fusion model doesn't disappoint. You notice right away from holding the SE model the Smart Quill technology. This year Puma takes it to another level with replaceable SmartQuill spikes with Fast Twist 2 directional locking technology for more grip. The Smart Quills combined with the iCell technology in the forefoot and heel of the shoe makes this not only more comfortable than the Tippers I reviewed but also give you better traction to the ground during your swing.

Looks
Puma doesn't pull any punches with its SE Cell Fusion model. The retro two-tone Puma stripe in yellow and green is eye catching to say the least. When I first wore them you should of heard the comments from my fashion conscience daughters as well from some of my playing partners. With the crystal blue base these are the slickest golf shoes Puma has released. It took some getting use to, the color combination but after awhile wearing with them with a Puma shirt and pants with similar color palettes I quickly got over it. From the pictures you'll also note the contrasting piping shoelaces. Puma gives you three extra sets of shoe laces to change it up whenever you like, a nice touch.

Feel and Comfort
After a few rounds, the SE Puma Cell Fusions proved to be a great lightweight, sturdy and comfortable golf shoe. I wore them straight out of the box no break in period here. My feet never seem to get tired or fatigued even in the heat we've been getting recently in the Ottawa area. The Smart Quill spikes provided great traction for all types of golf shots whether it was on the fairway, the bunker or the rough. The Cell Fusion's waterproof full-grain leather upper managed to keep me dry in some torrential rains recently and that can't be said for all golf shoes.

Conclusion
If you want a retro stylish looking golf shoe that Rickie Fowler wears, the SE Cell Fusion fits the bill. If you're a little more conservation the Cell Fusion's also comes in Black/White/Red and White/Snorkel Blue. Don't worry if you have a hard time matching them with rest of your golf wardrobe because Puma has some great SE apparel to go along with these shoes. Stay tuned for more reviews!

After a bit of getting use to I even managed to pull off wearing these golf shoes. How can you not like golf shoes that are so lightweight and comfortable and actually help your golf game. Better traction and stability awaits you with the Cell Fusion Special Edition Golf Shoes . SE Cell Fusion shoes can be bought online at the Puma Store. Retail value $180.00 USD. Trendy Golf also sells them as well as Fairway Styles.

Dutch is the sole official language, and is the language of education, government, business, and the media.[6] Over 60% of the population speaks Dutch as a mother tongue,[43] and most of the rest of the population speaks it as a second language. In 2004 Suriname became an associate member of the Dutch Language Union.[44]).[45].[46] and Portuguese are also used.. The public discourse about Suriname’s languages is a part of an ongoing debate about the country’s national identity.[46] The use of the popular Sranan became associated with nationalist politics after its public use by former dictator Dési Bouterse in the 1980s,[46] and groups descended from escaped slaves might resent it.[46] Some propose to change the national language to English, so as to improve links to the Caribbean and North America, or to Spanish, as a nod to Suriname’s location in South America, although it has no Spanish-speaking neighbours.[46]

The Walt Disney Company is well known for supporting Children’s Hospitals in the communities where it has a presence. In Florida they’ve built a whole pavilion for the Florida Hospital for Children. In California, the support for the Children’s Hospital of Orange County is great. That tradition will continue with the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort with Disney donating $3.1 million USD to fund Disney-themed play spaces and therapeutic play activities at children’s hospitals across China.

Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger announced the gift at the Shanghai Children’s Medical Center. Over the course of the five-year program, the donation will provide more than 50 hospitals in China with play rooms and therapeutic play activities. Disney will also donate Shanghai Disneyland theme park tickets to support children and their families as they undergo and recover from treatment.

“In honor of the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, we are creating a bit of Disney magic where it is needed most. With our gift of 20million RMB and tickets to our new theme park, we hope to bring happiness and laughter to children and families in hospitals across the country by creating opportunities to play and spend quality time together,” Iger said.

The donation will be administered by the Shanghai Charity Foundation for children’s hospitals in and around Shanghai, and by the China Soong Ching Ling Foundation for hospitals in the rest of China. The play curriculum and training will be designed and implemented by Right To Play, an international non-profit organization that uses the transformative power of play to educate and empower children to overcome adversity.

“Over the past few years, the Shanghai Children’s Medical Center has built several children’s play spaces with support from The Walt Disney Company,” said Jiang Zhongyi, Director of Shanghai Children’s Medical Center. “This new fund not only showcases Disney’s social responsibility and support for children, but also helps promote innovative new therapeutic play concepts that are helping transform children’s healthcare.”

Disney’s support of children’s hospitals dates back to the 1930s when Walt Disney would visit with children, often accompanied by Disney characters and animators. Today that support includes millions of dollars in annual grants and donations that provide play spaces, theme park tickets, first-run movies, care packages, in-kind support, and hospital visits from beloved Disney characters.

Disney has already supported several children’s hospitals in Shanghai through the development of play spaces, play therapy training, and character visits. Disney VoluntEARS have made more than 150 hospital visits and benefited more than 12,000 children and their families.

The present invention relates to an endoscope and a sheath which detachably covers an inserting tube of the endoscope.
Conventionally, the inserting tube of an endoscope is covered with a detachable sheath that is exchanged and discarded after each endoscopic inspection in order to prevent infection between patients via the endoscope.
The sheath includes an elastic tubular portion for covering the inserting tube and a cylindrical supporting portion connected to the proximal end of the tubular portion so as to allow the inserting tube to be inserted into the tubular portion through the supporting portion. The supporting portion is provided with an air feeding conduit for feeding air into and thereby inflating the tubular portion, and a packing for sealing a gap around the inserting tube being passed therethrough to prevent leaking of the air fed into the tubular portion.
The tubular portion is formed to have an inner diameter smaller than the outer diameter of the inserting tube. When inserting the inserting tube into the tubular portion in order to be covered therewith, the tubular portion is inflated by feeding air into it. The air feeding is stopped after the inserting tube has been fully inserted into the sheath so that the tubular portion shrinks and adheres on the inserting tube. In this manner, the inserting tube is covered with the tubular portion of the sheath without having any portion where the tubular portion floats therefrom. The sheath is put on the inserting tube in a manner as above since a floating portion of the sheath may cause the sheath to be snagged and even torn on a body wall when the inserting tube is inserted into a human body.
The conventional sheath, however, is relatively expensive since it is provided with the packing and the conduit for air feeding. Thus, the sheath has been one of the causes of increasing the endoscopic inspection cost.

Brussels grows specimens only under carefully controlled conditions, meticulously training each tree with wire and pruning over a period of years. If upon the tree's arrival some leaves have dropped or turned slightly brown that does not mean the bonsai is unhealthy. Defoliation is the natural result of being in the low-light environment of a shipping box. When you receive your tree, place the box in a shaded area to unpack. Inspect tree for damage to branches or leaves. Water soil if dry, and place the tree in. For more information on care and training visit Brussel's Bonsai on the Web.

Arteriovenous malformations of the tongue: a spectrum of disease.
To examine our vascular anomalies team's experience with tongue arteriovenous malformations (AVM) with specific emphasis on the spectrum on disease and surgical management. Retrospective chart review of 11 patients (10 female, 1 male), discovered from 1997 to 2005 with histological, radiographic, and clinical characteristics consistent with tongue AVM. Four patients displayed advanced disease with malformations involving the tongue, floor of mouth, and neck. Contributions from multiple feeding arteries were identified by angiography as each patient reported a prior history of surgical or embolic procedures. These lesions required preoperative embolization and extensive resection with complex reconstruction (mean operating time, 10.9 hr). One patient had evidence of recurrent disease (mean follow-up, 24.6 mo). In contrast, seven patients presented with discreet tongue malformations with a single feeding lingual artery. These patients reported no prior intervention, required only one resection (mean operating time, 2.8 hr), and have shown no evidence of recurrence (mean follow-up, 11 mo). Slight histologic differences between advanced versus focal tongue AVM were identified. This study suggests that tongue AVM can occur within a spectrum of disease with different clinical presentations, radiographic findings, and histology among patients with focal versus advanced lesions. Inadequate treatment is thought to contribute to collateral flow and disease progression in advanced AVM, making further management difficult. However, focal tongue AVM may represent early lesions that are more amenable to surgical management.

Recommendations for new riders. Carry extra food and water.. In winter time – Don’t rely on minimum lighting requirements. Consider carrying a front light. It is strongly recommended that riders use more that one rear red light.. Wear a reflective vest, reflective leg bands, and other brightly reflective clothing.. Carry a tool kit, spare inner tubes (and patches), and perhaps a spare fold-up tire. Be sure your pump is working.. Be prepared for weather. Make sure you take along clothes to protect you from cold and wet conditions.. Mud Guards are strongly recommended.. Ziploc bags are useful for keeping phones & food dry.. Road surfaces vary. Narrow tires suffer more impact punctures but wider tires have more drag. If riding a mountain bike, consider using slick tires.. Use a sensible gear range.. Author: Colm Staunton

The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for secure distribution of program content, which are directed to the prevention of unauthorized copying and/or distribution of the program content.
Program content may include application programs, such as video game programs, word processing programs, spread sheet programs, etc.; and system programs, such as operating systems, boot programs, etc. Program content, such as computer programs, are typically distributed to end-users by way of transportable storage media, such as CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, etc., which contain the program content. Program content may also be distributed to end-users by way of downloading the program content over a network, such as from a server to the user over the Internet.
The conventional methods for distributing program content are not secure because unauthorized copies thereof may be made and shared among a plurality of end-users. For example, if a computer program is distributed to a particular end-user by way of a storage medium, that user may permit unauthorized copies of the computer program to be distributed and stored on equipment controlled by other end-users. Typically, these unauthorized copies are stored on hard disk drives, CD-ROMs, and the like. Similarly, if the computer program is distributed to the end-user by way of transmission over a network, unauthorized copies of the computer program may be made and distributed to other users. For example, once the computer program is stored on the authorized end-user's equipment, he or she may forward a copy of the computer program to another user by way of a storage medium (e.g., an optical disk, a magnetic disk, etc.) or by way of an attachment to an electronic mail message.
Accordingly, there are needs in the art for new methods and apparatus for the secure distribution of program content to end-users, which ameliorates the problems associated with the proliferation of unauthorized copies of the program content.

Curious how your email marketing fares against the average email marketer? Silverpop’s 2012 Email Marketing Metrics Benchmark Study has those figures. Check ‘em:. 1. Identify the trouble spots. If your open rate is significantly beneath even the average, you’re probably dealing with a largely inactive list. That could drive a decision to launch a re-engagement initiative or rethink your acquisition process.. 2. Use the numbers to lobby for the additional budget resources you need to improve your program. Be sure to focus on the areas that have the greatest potential to help you achieve departmental or corporate goals, such as higher revenue, reduced expenses, more conversions or better customer retention.. Remember, benchmarks tell you what’s average, not necessarily what’s target for your industry or your program. But they can offer some insight into what’s typical and motivate you to keep improving your own program.

Inside Intelligence: About Those Political Plans...

The attorney general has $12 million in his campaign account and has done a terrible job of keeping secret his ambition to run for governor of the state. The governor, meanwhile, has three years left in his term, is just back from a fruitless run for president and is trying to knock down any talk that he might be a lame duck. He's done that by saying he might run for another term in the middle office and hasn't ruled out another run for president, should the stars align.

So what if they ran into each other in 2014? The insiders think Greg Abbott would win. Only a third picked Rick Perry in that hypothetical head-to-head, while 60 percent would bet on the AG.

We asked about real races, too. With four well-funded candidates (from a total of 10) seeking the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, 62 percent of the insiders expect a runoff in that race; about a third expect it to end in the first round, on May 29.

The only current officeholder in the race for the open seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, state Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, is the insiders' favorite to win that contest. While 56 percent chose Chisum, 39 percent think the winner will be Christi Craddick.

We closed with an essay question this week, asking the insiders — on the eve of a new filing period for political races in Texas — who might provide the biggest surprises.

As always, we have attached the full set of verbatim answers to the questions. A sampling follows:

Who would win a Republican gubernatorial primary between Greg Abbott and Rick Perry?

• "At this point, just about anybody could beat Perry in the Republican primary--which is why I don't think Perry will run again. If Dewhurst wins a 6-year U.S. Senate term, even he might decide to challenge Perry. Then, Dewhurst could have the job he always wanted and also appoint his replacement in Washington. Such a deal."

• "What are you kidding?! After that presidential debacle it will be ANYBODY BUT PERRY!"

• "The frost is off that pumpkin. This presidential primary wasn't exactly a Phil Gramm '96 failure. It was an embarrassment of the state. His repeated failures were a reflection on all Texans. The R's would rather shoot their own dog than have D's shoot it for them."

• "The last Texan to beat Rick Perry in a Texas primary was... Gimme a minute. It'll come to me. Damn, what was his name?"

• "Question assumes Perry would actually run again, and Abbott would have the political chops to take him on. He doesn't."

• "Abbott's main, and perhaps only, argument that he can use in unseating Perry, is that 'it's time for him to go.' That didn't work for KBH. Republicans are going to have a hard time throwing out Perry without a really good reason. What's he done that Republicans have really hated?"

• "They both appeal to the same segment of Republican primary voters. Perry has long-term relationships on his side, but Abbott has a mostly unvarnished record on his."

Will there be a runoff in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate this year?

• "Yes, and it will be ugly."

• "Money like love conquers ALL! Hello Senator Dewhurst!"

• "Dewhurst should have a comfortable margin but under 50% because of the size of the field."

• "Dewhurst will drown out the others on TV and win without a runoff."

• "Still can't see a combo of Cruz/Leppert/James getting to 50%, but the later we keep moving the date back, that probability increases exponentially."

• "Whether or not Dewhurst can get to 50% in the first round is an open question, but he better hope he can. A low turnout runoff would be a nightmare scenario for him, and would render his name ID and financial advantages irrelevant. Look for the Dew to launch a takedown of Cruz in the next couple of months."

• "It depends on if some of the lesser candidates continue with their vanity campaigns."

• "Absent a major misstep by Dewhurst, there will be no runoff. Polls that say otherwise are not credible."

Who will win the race for Elizabeth Ames Jones' seat on the Texas Railroad Commission?

• "Who's for eliminating the agency?"

• "Not the most-qualified, the one who has worked in the industry for decades. Instead it’ll likely be the flake who’s-out-but-may-now-be-back-in after winning the Ft. Worth straw poll, or the entitled daughter of a certain former speaker, or the far right's favorite legislator."

• "In a down ballot this cycle, Chisum's history of social conservatism gives him a huge edge."

• "The one woman with the last name people have heard before? Yeah, that one."

• "Would hope one of the others, but the name CRADDICK will be the most recognized name in this race"

• "Becky Berger will be disappointed to learn that 'Inside Intelligence' does not have her in the race. A runoff in the GOP is likely between Craddick and one of the white guys. The winner of that will be the next Commissioner."

• "Warren has all of the advantages of experience in the industry, personal connections galore, and decades as a public figure. He's campaigning with all the energy of a 20-year-older to boot. Christi might make it in politics one day, but this isn't the day."

• "All one had to do is look at the resumes. I believe Chisum will be strong and have what it takes to win it. Those that support him publicly, however, will feel the pain next session. Dads hate when someone messes with their daughter."

• "Names are powerful. Look at Carrillo, the odds-on, industry-backed favorite, an incumbent no less, getting upended by Porter, a complete unknown. Craddick could win this on name alone."

As soon as election dates are set, the federal redistricting judges have said they will set a new deadline for campaign filing, allowing candidates to sign up for races, to drop out, or to amend filings they made earlier. What will be the biggest surprise? [Editor's note: We asked this before the court set a May 29 primary and a March 9 filing deadline.]

• "Pete Gallego might actually have a real race."

• "A last minute serious challenger to a 'comfy' incumbent."

• "An actual election!"

• "Doggett switches to U.S. Senate race."

• "Debra Medina for Railroad Commissioner"

• "Who doesn't run again!"

• "North Texas state senate races"

• "More House members announcing their retirement."

• "No surprises. It's hard to keep a secret in our political world. The birds like to sing."

• "If I told you it would not be a surprise."

• "How about the biggest surprise is that the courts decided to act after wasting weeks of time and tons of money?

Treatment o f Ln2(S 0 4)3 • nH 20 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm. Eu, Gd ; n -8, 9) with phenelzine dihydrogen sulfate, (phzH2) S 0 4, in 1 N H2S 0 4 yields polymeric complexes with the general formula [L n (S 0 4)2(H 20) 2(phzH)], which contain the phzH+ cation as a ligand. The compounds have been characterized by elem ental analyses, X-ray powder patterns, thermal methods, magnetic susceptibilities and spectroscopic (IR, Raman, electronic diffuse reflec tance and solid-state emission f -f spectra) studies.

This invention relates to a device for disposing of a recording medium by forming thereon a provisional record of a pattern, such as a picture, and by thereafter processing the provisional record into a final record of the pattern. The device may be, for example, an electrostatic facsimile receiver.
In a facsimile transmission and reception system, a transmitter supplies a receiver or receivers with signals representative of a picture or the like. In a conventional electrostatic facsimile receiver, a continuous recording paper is caused to pass by a recording unit for forming thereon latent images of a plurality of successive pictures and is subsequently fed into a developing and fixing unit for developing and fixing the latent images into visible reproductions of the respective pictures. In such a receiver, particularly for the known runlength-coded signals or for similar signals with redundancy reduction, the speed at which the recording paper runs by the recording unit towards the developing and fixing unit is adjusted in compliance with the speed selected at the transmitter in consideration of the density of lines or the like of each picture. As a result of the variation in the speed of feed, unevenness or irregularity in developing and fixing has been unavoidable to deteriorate the reproduced pictures. Deterioration of a record has been inevitable also in a device for disposing of a continuous sheet or separate sheets of recording medium when the medium is caused to pass by a recording unit towards a provisional record processing unit with various speeds of feed.

Unverricht-Lundborg disease with cystatin B gene abnormalities.
The clinical, neurophysiologic, and genetic findings in two Japanese patients with the Unverricht-Lundborg type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy are described. The cystatin B gene of Patient 1 exhibited expansion of the dodecamer (12-mer) repeat located in the 5' region and a point mutation (G-->A mutation) in exon 2. The cystatin B gene of Patient 2 exhibited homozygous expansion of the dodecamer repeat. Both parents of Patient 2 were heterozygous carriers. The two patients had a similar clinical course, and their symptoms were similar to those of previously reported patients in Finland. They both had a good response to zonisamide and low-dose primidone. We recommend that zonisamide and low-dose primidone should be introduced as the first drugs of choice for the treatment of patients with the Unverricht-Lundborg type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy.

The Best Diet for Weight Loss

As an obesity physician, I survey all of my patients about their diets. I also make note of the patients who are the most successful at losing and keeping off their weight. There is ONE trait that every successful patient shares in common. Is it their carbohydrate count? Are they vegans? Do they track their calories on an app? Are they on amphetamines? The answer may shock you…. or maybe not.

The answer: They all found their own way to sustainably lower their energy intake.

When I get a new patient coming in for weight loss, I give them my book The Fat Loss Prescription (Get through Amazon here,). I tend to push a more “Mediterranean” style low carbohydrate diet, which focuses on foods that are shown to improve mortality AND satiety (the satiety is important for sustainability). But as I work with the patients throughout the months, the diet changes into something that fits the patient’s personal preferences and life schedule.

Here is just a handful of ways they do it:

They literally keep their same diet, but found a way to eat less of it. Maybe they eat slower now or maybe they keep the extra servings in the kitchen. Many will use salad plates instead of dinner plates to trick their mind into thinking they ate just as much. Some of then do in fact track their calories with an app and when they get to their calorie goal, they stop. This one always makes me smile because I think it is less than ideal but who the hell am I to judge?

They went to a low carb or vegan diet (or another diet that restricts food groups). How could I lump these things together? These diets totally cut out either a whole macronutrient (like carbohydrates) or food groups (animal products). Paleo works as well for the same reason. These also entail (should anyway) increasing vegetables and other high satiety foods. Either way, many will not need to track their calories because their calories will be lowered automatically if they follow the diet correctly.

They replaced meals. People think protein shakes are just for meat heads. However, there is a lot of evidence that replacing your meals with a low energy protein shake will increase your chances at weight loss success. You replace a high calorie meal with a low calorie, high satiating protein shake. Makes sense.

They practice fasting. I have had some patients go to an intermittent fasting style of dieting. Whether they cut 1-2 days or restrict when they eat during the day, they find that this works better than just keeping calories controlled all day every day.

I am getting quite annoyed at the arguing over which diet is best for weight loss. There are physicians, researchers, fitness professionals, etc. who demand that their way is best. The most vocal are the low carbohydrate advocates as they blame obesity on insulin. I am an advocate of a low carbohydrate diet (especially for my insulin resistant/pre diabetic/type 2 diabetic patients). However, you would be astonished at how many of my patients who are successful who do not follow a low carbohydrate diet. It would be nice if we could just shift our efforts from arguing online to helping those who are actually in need of weight loss.

Improving the quality of operation notes: Effect of using proforma, audit and education sessions.
Both from a medical and legal point of view, the quality of operative notes are important. In this study we hypothesized that the quality of operation notes could be improved by audit, education session and using a proforma. A total of 150 operation notes were audited for compliance with the Royal College of Surgeons guidelines. Results were announced in-clinic training session and guidelines were discussed. An aide-memoire containing guideline parameters placed in the operating theaters. After eight months, operation reports were re-audited on an equal number of patients. An operative note proforma was developed and third audit was carried out. The results of each audit were compared. In the first audit, it was found that fourteen parameters were written with more than 90% accuracy. The first audit revealed seven poor areas in documentation: time of operation (0%), identification of emergency/elective procedure (0%), identification of any prosthesis or devices used (65.3%), details of closure technique (36.6%), name of anesthesiologist (0%), patient position (1.3%), and amount of bleeding (0%). In the second audit there was an incomplete, but significant improvement in these seven parameters (28%, 28.6%, 82%, 75.3%, 31.3%, 32%, and 34% respectively). Following introduction of the proforma; third audit cycle demonstrated a clear improvement in operation note documentation with at least 80% compliance in all parameters. This study revealed that the accuracy of the operating room documents can be improved through audits, education of surgeon and using proformas. The use of proforma provides much better results.

Outlook and Market Review - Third Quarter 2015. PDF File:. Summary:. The Bureau of Economic Analysis revised third quarter U.S. GDP growth to 2.1% from the flash report of only 1.5%. Most of the revised gain was due to inventory adjustments, which may constrain fourth quarter growth. On a year-over-year basis the economy continues to track along a 2.2% to 2.4% growth trend. Inflation continues to be below the Fed target of 2% for both the core and headline personal consumption expenditure (PCE) indices. Weak demand and low energy prices are expected to keep inflation below the Fed target throughout 2015 and most of 2016. The unemployment rate is 5%, close to what may be full employment given current conditions. Nevertheless, capacity utilization remains well below full employment levels with ample room for expansion before excess demand pressures and bottlenecks introduce inflation pressures.

I've had mine for about 9 mos or so and was looking to try and get rid of the stuff the phone accumulates that we just don't need. Invalid extensions, unused files etc. I understand that a data/cache wipe is one way. Is there a specific way to do this? I'm running BB 0.4 and I'm about to install Indigo Glass. I was hoping to start over fresh with the droid. I have Titanium Backup and Rom Manager. Will a quick backup with one of those save all of my essential data? If not, how do I save the good stuff and not the bad? Thanks, all.

The stroke navigator: meaningful use of the electronic health record to efficiently report inpatient stroke care quality.
To facilitate high-quality inpatient care for stroke patients, we built a system within our electronic health record (EHR) to identify stroke patients while they are in the hospital; capture necessary data in the EHR to minimize the burden of manual abstraction for stroke performance measures, decreasing daily time requirement from 2 hours to 15 minutes; generate reports using an automated process; and electronically transmit data to third parties. Provider champions and support from the EHR development team ensured that we balanced the needs of the hospital with those of frontline providers. This work summarizes the development and implementation of our stroke quality system.

Blood pressure is the major driving force for plaque formation in aortic-constricted ApoE-/- mice.
Using an aortic constriction model in mice, we studied whether the increase in pressure or the activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and its main receptors is the main driving force for plaque progression. Male ApoE mice underwent sham surgery or placement of a suprarenal silver clip around the aorta (AoC). Half the group was treated with the selective AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (30 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks. Anesthetized mean arterial pressure (MAP) was increased in AoC mice compared to sham (106 +/- 3 versus 90 +/- 1 mmHg, P < 0.001). Losartan reduced MAP in sham mice (78 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.01) but not in AoC (AoC losartan 104 +/- 2 mmHg). Plasma renin concentration (PRC) was increased in AoC mice compared to sham [1.6 +/- 0.3 versus 0.8 +/- 0.2 milliGoldblatt units (mGU)/ml, P < 0.001]. Losartan treatment augmented this difference (18.7 +/- 3.7 versus 4.6 +/- 1.7 mGU/ml, P < 0.01). AT2 receptor mRNA expression was increased 5.8-fold by aortic constriction in thoracic aorta (P < 0.05) and the major site for expression of the AT2 receptor protein was within the plaques. The plaque area was increased in AoC mice compared to sham (0.61 +/- 0.09 versus 0.07 +/- 0.01%, P < 0.001); however, losartan did not alter plaque area. Our data do not support a role for the AT1 receptor in the progression of atherosclerosis in this model, since blockade with losartan did not alter plaque distribution. Furthermore, we found no support for the counteraction of atherogenesis by increased activity of the RAS acting on the AT2 receptor. Our data suggest that increased pressure is the main driving force for atherosclerosis in this model.

My mother used to make pot roast in foil, and this evening I’m carrying on the family tradition. Tear off about a five-foot piece of 18-inch-wide aluminum foil. Set the piece of pot roast in the center of it; surround it with chunks of potato, baby carrots, and an onion, cut into chunks. Sprinkle on a couple tablespoons of minced garlic and two packets of Lipton’s Onion Soup mix. Fold the foil into a packet, creasing the seams so they’re steam-tight. Before you seal the packet, add about a quarter-cup of water. Set the packet in a baking pan and cook in the oven at 350F for about two hours. Yummy goodness. Mrs. R says you can do it in the crock-pot, but it’s just not the same. Part of it must be the ritual of preparation..

The Department of Health and Human Services has officially released the final rule for the Quality Payment Program under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA).. The Quality Payment Program, which will begin on January 1, 2017, replaces the sustainable growth rate and will reportedly allow providers to deliver more flexible, patient-centered care. According to HHS, MACRA and the Quality Payment Program will help drive the industry away from a volume-based system to value-based care models. The Quality Payment Program will reward providers for value-based care via two avenues: Advanced Alternative Payment Models (Advanced APMs) and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS).

1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to compositions for use as adhesion promoters on polyolefin substrates and to a method of applying such compositions to the polyolefin substrate. More particularly, the present invention relates to compositions containing chlorinated polyolefins for use as adhesion promoters and to a method of applying such compositions to polyolefin substrates.
2. Brief Description of the Prior Art
Polyolefins such as ethylene and propylene as well as copolymers thereof are being used in increasing amounts in the fabrication of automobile bodies and trim such as front end fascia and filler panels located between the bumper and the chassis. These materials are light weight and have excellent impact resistance. They can withstand low speed collisions much better than metal counterparts. However, to be aesthetically acceptable, the polyolefin must be painted to match the paint on the rest of the automobile. Because of the low surface tension of polyolefins, it is very difficult to adhere paint directly to the surface of the polyolefin.
It is known in the industry that the adhesion of a paint layer to a polyolefin substrate can be improved if the substrate is first treated with an adhesion promoter. Typical adhesion promoters are solutions of chlorinated polyolefins which when applied as a coating to the polyolefin substrate act as a tie layer between the polyolefin and the subsequently applied paint. However, if the adhesion promoter is not applied uniformly to the polyolefin substrate, the adhesion of the subsequently applied coating will fail.
It is an object of the present invention to provide a detectable adhesion promoting composition, that is, one which when applied to the polyolefin substrate can be determined if it has been applied uniformly to the substrate.

WHY IS THIS TOPIC IMPORTANT?. The subconscious mind and the non-voluntary behavior of our nervous system gives us much trouble in life. I, therefore, find it extremely important to understand the mechanisms and what I can do about it to gain control over my behavior on all levels of life, both body and mind.. We have all heard about the subconscious mind as something outside yourself or a part of our mind we cannot control. Sometimes it works against us and we, therefore, need to reprogram it. We know very little about it and this can be frightening, especially when we realize how much it can impact our lives.. Continue reading “Conscious vs. subconscious mind, who am I?”

Identification of ononitol and O-methyl-scyllo-inositol in pea root nodules.
Ononitol (4-O-methyl-myo-inositol) and O-methyl-scyllo-inositol were identified in pea (Pisum sativum L.) root nodules formed by twoRhizobium leguminosarum strains. Ononitol was the major soluble carbohydrate in nodules formed by strain 1045 while O-methyl-scyllo-inositol and two unidentified components were dominant in the carbohydrate pattern of the nodules formed by strain 1 a. The cyclitols were also present in the denodulated roots, but to a much smaller extent; in the above-ground plant parts only traces were found. The identification of ononitol and O-methyl-scyllo-inositol was established by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry utilizing trimethylsilyl- and acetyl-derivatives.

Tannic acid exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on formalin-induced paw edema model of inflammation in rats.
The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between anti-inflammatory effects of the natural polyphenolic compound tannic acid (CAS number: 1401-55-4) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme activity in paw edema model. Thirty-five female rats were divided into five groups. The paws of rats were injected subcutaneously in the plantar surface with formalin except for the control group. Indomethacin and tannic acid were intraperitoneally administered 1 h after formalin injection. The paws volume was measured by using vernier caliper. MPO enzyme activity was determined using 4-aminoantipyrine-phenol solution as the substrate for MPO-mediated oxidation by H2O2. About 17% and 13% edema inhibition has detected in the indomethacin-applied group, at the measurements run every other hour right after the treatment. An inhibition of 16% was found at the group treated with 25 mg/kg tannic acid. However, in the group treated with 50 mg/kg tannic acid, 15% and 7% of the edema inhibition was observed. Serum and paw tissue MPO activities were decreased in treated groups with indomethacin and tannic acid according to formalin control group. Our study results suggest that tannic acid may contribute to the treatment of inflammation by decreasing MPO enzyme activity, but the molecular mechanism is still not clear.

Enbridge gets EPA approval for 2012 oil spill cleanup plans.. Jason Manshum is an Enbridge spokesman. He says Enbridge’s plans for 20-12 include assessing how much submerged oil remains in the Kalamazoo River.. “That will determine…along with…looking at the science data we’re receiving…how much work …if any.. needs to be done…going into the summer and fall 2012," says Manshum.. That could mean scaling back the cleanup operation. However, state and federal environmental regulators will have the final say on when the oil spill cleanup will be complete.. In the meantime, Enbridge crews continue to remove oil from wetland areas this winter. And in the Spring, Enbridge crews will resume efforts to remove submerged oil from three different segments of the river.

Statement on Ecuador Court Ruling Against Chevron

Evidence Prevails Over Oil Giant's Intimidation Tactics

San Francisco, CA – Today a court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador has ruled in favor of the residents of Ecuador's Amazon region who have spent the last 18 years seeking damages for crude oil pollution. Chevron inherited the suit when it bought Texaco in 2001, and has denied the allegations of environmental damage.

Amazon Watch and Rainforest Action Network, who have spent years working to help the Ecuadorian people and protect the Amazon, release the following statement in response to today's verdict:

"As of today, Chevron's guilt for extensive oil contamination in the Amazon rainforest is official. It is time Chevron takes responsibility for these environmental and public health damages, which they have fought for the past 18 years.

"Today's ruling in Ecuador against Chevron proves overwhelmingly that the oil giant is responsible for billions of gallons of highly toxic waste sludge deliberately dumped into local streams and rivers, which thousands depend on for drinking, bathing, and fishing.

"Chevron has spent the last 18 years waging unprecedented public relations and lobbying campaigns to avoid cleaning up the environmental and public health catastrophe it left in the Amazon rainforest. Today's guilty verdict sends a loud and clear message: It is time Chevron clean up its disastrous mess in Ecuador.

"Today's case is historic and unprecedented. It is the first time Indigenous people have sued a multinational corporation in the country where the crime was committed and won.

"Today's historic ruling against Chevron is a testament to the strength of the Ecuadorian people who have spent 18 years bringing Chevron to justice while suffering the effects of the company's extensive oil contamination."

According to a survey published in Doane’s Agricultural Report, animal welfare is one of the top megatrends that agriculture faces today. Animal welfare came in at the No. 7 spot.. However, it’s important to remember that animal welfare and animal rights are not the same thing. People who are advocates of animal welfare want to spare animals physical pain and suffering — that’s something that livestock producers generally agree with as good animal husbandry makes both moral and economic sense. On the other hand, people who are animal rights advocates give human attributes to animals and consider all animal agriculture inhumane..

Not all of us are lucky enough to live near or by the beach where we can get the natural tan appearance. However, with the damaging effect of exposure to the sun, science and beauty experts have come up with a way to achieve sun-kissed glow without exposing one’s self to the harmful ultraviolet rays. Excessive sun exposure can cause wrinkles and may speed up aging. Hence, the sunless tanning.

Self-tanning or sunless tanning is an alternative to sunbathing. Self-tanning involves the application of chemicals to the skin to achieve sun tan. It has become popular after scientists and health experts have strengthen the link between exposure from the sunlight or tanning beds and skin cancer. In 1960, the first sunless tanning product by Coppertone was released in the form of a lotion. While self-tanner are commonly sold as lotion or spray that can be directly applied to the skin, there are also tanning pills and bronzers that emerged. Generally, self-tanning or sunless tanning is considered safe provided they are used as directed.

So how does a sunless tanner or self-tanner work? Before we move on to the specifics, it will be helpful to be reminded that self-tanning occurs in the epidermis or the outer layer of the skin. One active ingredient in self-tanning products is the dihydroxyacetone (DHA). The dihydroxyacetone is a colorless three-carbon sugar that, when applied, reacts with the dead skin cells. This reaction will result in a change of color and darkening the skin. As the skin gets a change in its color, you will likewise experience a starchy odor that usually comes during the tanning process. This odor is believed to be an indication of the progress of your sunless tan.

The color change is temporary and may last for only five to seven days. It is only temporary because only the stratum corneum, or the outermost layer of the epidermis, is stained. Eventually, this layer is shed by process of exfoliation especially with the use of exfoliating products or scrubs. Many have raised their eyebrows on the safety of the DHA. Since 1973, the Food and Drug Administration has approved DHA for external or self-tanning use. This is subject to an exception where the FDA has not approved the application of DHA near the eyes, mouth, or nose. It is advised to protect these parts of the body when applying self-tanning products, particularly in spray form also use one of the best self tanner on the market is very important.

Another method of sunless tanning is the use of bronzer. Bronzer, which is normally in the form of powder and moisturizer, stains the skin upon application. Unlike other methods, the stain from bronzer can be easily removed by washing it off with soap and water. For tanning pills, on the other hand, are generally considered as unsafe. They are said to contain canthaxanthin, which is used as color additive and in large amount when used as tanning agent. It turns your skin into an orange or brown color, which has been linked to liver damage, hepatitis, and visual impairment.

Behavioural thermoregulation and the relative roles of convection and radiation in a basking butterfly.
Poikilothermic animals are often reliant on behavioural thermoregulation to elevate core-body temperature above the temperature of their surroundings. Butterflies are able to do this by altering body posture and location while basking, however the specific mechanisms that achieve such regulation vary among species. The role of the wings has been particularly difficult to describe, with uncertainty surrounding whether they are positioned to reduce convective heat loss or to maximise heat gained through radiation. Characterisation of the extent to which these processes affect core-body temperature will provide insights into the way in which a species׳ thermal sensitivity and morphological traits have evolved. We conducted field and laboratory measurements to assess how basking posture affects the core-body temperature of an Australian butterfly, the common brown (Heteronympha merope). We show that, with wings held open, heat lost through convection is reduced while heat gained through radiation is simultaneously maximised. These responses have been incorporated into a biophysical model that accurately predicts the core-body temperature of basking specimens in the field, providing a powerful tool to explore how climate constrains the distribution and abundance of basking butterflies.

Gryglewicz, S.(., Mancini, L., Morellec, E., Schroth, E. and Valta, P. (2021). Understanding Cash Flow Risk Review of Financial Studies, :.. - Affiliated author. - Publication year2021. - JournalReview of Financial Studies. Theory has recently shown that corporate policies should depend on firms' exposure to short- and long-lived cash flow shocks and the correlation between these shocks. We provide granular estimates of these parameters for Compustat firms using a new filter that uses only cash flow data and the theoretical restrictions of a canonical cash flow model. As predicted by theory, we find that the estimated parameters are strongly related to corporate liquidity and financing choices, that firms with a higher estimated correlation between shocks implement riskier policies, and that the sign of this correlation determines the cash flow sensitivity of cash.

NHS Blood and Transplant Youth Campaign. Challenge. Mobas was asked by NHS Blood and Transplant to create a campaign that would specifically target the youth market and focus around college freshers. It needed to encourage sign up within that market and needed to have a fun approach.. Strategy. The real challenge was to create a campaign which appealed to a young market without appearing to be a corporate trying too hard to be ‘cool’. It was important to keep the campaign simple but to be very eye catching as the target market would be being hit with a lot of advertising and promotion from lots of different industries. It also needed to appeal to both males and females from different ethnic backgrounds.. Results. The campaign was rolled out across the country and received great feedback. It continues to stand out in a crowd and encourage donation from the target market.

Steven Spielberg has warned that a future ruled by virtual reality is coming "whether we like it or not".

Presenting his upcoming sci-fi film at this year's Comic-Con in San Diego on Friday, the acclaimed director addressed what has recently been a recurring topic for him.

Virtual reality, or VR, began its expansion in the film industry over the last year, with the Cannes Film Festival presenting its first VR entry this year.

Carne Y Arena (Meat And Sand) by Birdman director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu had its debut at the Croisette in May, opening alongside Spielberg's studio animation The BFG.

At the time, the Schindler's List director warned of the dangers virtual reality could present to the industry.


"I think we're moving into a dangerous medium with virtual reality," he said.

Spielberg goes VR for Ready Player One

"The only reason I say it is dangerous is because it gives the viewer a lot of latitude not to take direction from the storytellers but make their own choices of where to look.

"I just hope it doesn't forget the story when it starts enveloping us in a world that we can see all around us and make our own choices to look at."

Now he seems to have, if not changed his mind, at least embraced the future.

Presenting his new film Ready Player One, Spielberg spoke about the challenges of adapting Ernest Cline's book about a dystopian future where humans take refuge in VR after the world is destroyed by global warming.

In the film, the hero lives in 2044, but spends his time immersed in 1980s pop culture through virtual reality.

"It's the most amazing flash forward and flashback at the same time - to a decade I was very much involved in as well as a future that I think is out there awaiting all of us whether we like it or not," Spielberg said.

Image: Spielberg, Cline and actor Tye Sheridan shared the stage at Comic-Con

The 70-year-old director now sees VR as the opening of new possibilities, where humans are able to do "anything you can possibly imagine".

Directing Ready Player One, Spielberg was faced with 80s nostalgia and pop references related to his own work in the past, and said he feared being "vilified for some kind of grand act of grand larceny of vanity".

For the book's author, having the director taking on his book was a match made in heaven.

"To be honest with you, I thought this would never happen," Ernest Cline said at Comic-Con.

"I never thought we'd be able to make this movie, because we'd need someone like Steven Spielberg to direct it.

"And when they told me they were going to send it to him I was like, 'oh, he's never going to do it'."

Ready Player One premieres 30 March 2018.

Preferring Local Control

It’s two weeks already. Wow. The English thing is rad. Just think if Iowans had the guts to throw off the chains of the Federales. Caramba! But Iowans would rather have the crumbs than freedom and the prosperity that comes with it. Comfy, eh?

Preferring Local Control

Back in the days when socialism was failing in the Soviet Union (The system failed. Ronald Reagan had nothing to do with it.), I had a friend who traveled to Latvia on a farm tour. I remember what he found when he got there.

Imagine a field of oats, just beginning to head out, a stunted pale yellow with cracked soil easily visible through the canopy. The farmer had actually planted the oats in the rain because the call had come from Moscow, five hundred miles away, that it was time. The farmer ignored local conditions to be loyal to the central authority that had promised social justice at any price.

I doubt that any farmer hasn’t longed for the comfort of following orders at a job rather than the risk and responsibility of ownership.

The dairy operation was also an eye opener for the American tourist. No directive ever came for a manure management plan. The manure was pitched out of the barn, apparently so they could walk around in there, and that was it. When there was no room outside the doors and windows to pitch more, an elevator was set up and the manure deposited several feet from the barn until it reached up to the outlet of the elevator. The elevator was swung around in a half circle until the manure reached the top in all possible directions. Then another elevator was brought in.

The oats lacked fertilizer in the the hard baked mud. The farmer never hauled the manure onto the fields and he planted in the worst possible conditions. How could this happen?

The Brexit vote can shed a light on events that led up to the terrible management of that farm.

The most basic unit of government is the individual. Next we are part of a family, then a neighborhood, then a town, and so forth. Each step away from ourselves lessens the importance to us and also the quality of our decisions. It can’t be helped, as illustrated by the failure of the Latvian farmer and his Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

It could be argued that, not only is the European Union too big, but England is too big as well. There is evidence that there are neighborhoods in England where Sharia Law rules above the law of jolly old England. Space limits the description of the difference, but believe me, English Common Law is what we are used to and Sharia is not.

This is a direct result of a government that tries to be inclusive of too many cultures. Scotland and Ireland have become dependent on handouts from Mother England. Their economies have been weakened by the presence of someone else available to pay for careless management so they voted to remain in the union. Greece’s welfare state may have grown to unsustainable proportions with their dependence on the EU. But do the people of the more frugal and productive nations in the union deserve to spend part of each workday stuffing grape leaves for slothful olive farmers?

So far nothing has been written about actual consequences of Brexit, only about the emotional reactions rooted in the uncertainty of the change. But if you lived there would you like the EU (funny how that sounds like something stinks) making regulations to suit an entire continent? You can’t recycle a teabag? A child under eight can’t blow up a balloon? You can’t use better windows in trucks to make cyclists more visible?

Here in the U.S. we had a perfect example of a union of states that could compete and thus improve themselves or face loss of population. There is no federal constitutional authority for the laws that limit that competition today. There is no federal law against murder. If one state wanted a law making abortion legal, and another didn’t, the competition between the morally debased abortion state and the one that valued all its citizens would eventually sort out which society failed and which one flourished. The same would hold true for any number of issues: homosexual marriage, drug prohibition, corporate welfare, and environmental regulation come to mind.

I hope the Brexit vote inspires more governments to downsize and serve their people more efficiently. Our own Civil War was a turning point in American history. At least 600,000 people died to preserve a union that now rewards nonsense over voluntary relations.

We can be thankful to the EU for not resorting to murder to stifle Brexit, like Lincoln did.

I recently made a pair of biracial dolls with natural hair for a beautiful set of siblings from Chicago. It was so fun to make the little costumes for the dolls too. And I really love how the curls framing the little girl's face turned out!

Plastic surgeon Dr. Drew Ordon demonstrates how to rejuvenate marionette lines on the face to restore a youthful look.Read the full transcript »

Reversing Facial Marionette Lines Jim: Here’s a good one. This is on Facebook. This is Erica Thompson writing. She asks when my faces at rest, my lips go down at the corners. Is there a procedure to fix that? And it sounds a question, like a questions for Dr. Ordon there. Dr. Ordon: Now, Jim that such a great question. I get in the office all the time. What would help me is if I had prop out here, a little ahead to show people how would take care of that. Nobody likes that sneer look. You know, number one. What is cause? Well, it’s combination of gravity things falling a little bit and loosing volume in the face. How do I fix it? Well, typically it’s combination of two things. Thank you. Well, that’s what I called good service. So, you know, so called sneer or merry in that line, I see it all the time in the office. It’s when the corner of your mouth is down turn in here, it gives a sneering look to your face. It’s caused by two things; gravity, just gravity pulling down like so and as we age we also loose volume in the face. It’s a combination of gravity and volume. Dr. Shears: But if you keep smiling all the time. Dr. Ordon: Well, it’s a¿this isn’t as much as smiling as crows feet. Dr. Shears: Okay. Dr. Ordon: This is more gravity and volume. So how do we fix it? Well, number one we want to add volume to the corner of the mouth here that so called merry in that line with fillers typically hyaluronic acid and we do a little maneuver where we weave that hyaluronic acid right along the corner of the mouth and that will actually lift that mouth up a little bit. Finally, a little touch of buttocks right here, it will actually bring that lip up. So the solution typically two folds of fillers and some buttocks. Dr. Shears: With some fillers and buttocks. Jim: Which is fairly quick in the office procedure? Dr. Ordon: Yes. Because your face, what really isn’t going to help that spot. The face lift will help erase the wavy line, it will help you in the cheek, the jaw, with the botox stops right here, it’s not going to pull up the corner of the mouth. Dr. Shears: Thank you. Jim: Thank you Dr. Ordon. And Dr. Shears for sharing those great questions with us.

Egbert Coleby Morland

Egbert Coleby Morland  (1874–1955) was an English physician and medical editor.

After education at Whitgift School in Croydon and then at Bootham School in York, Egbert Morland studied at Owens College, Manchester, where he graduated BSc in 1893. By means of a scholarship, he studied medicine at St Bartholomew’s Hospital, where he qualified in 1897 MRCS and graduated in 1898 MB with the gold medal in physiology. He held appointments as house physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital and to the Great Ormond Street Hospital, but he developed pulmonary tuberculosis with haemoptysis. He had to abandon his house appointments and seek treatment in Switzerland. His fiancée Mary Latchmore insisted on marrying him (in 1903) and nursed him back to better health.

Morland decided to stay in Switzerland and to specialise in the treatment of tuberculosis. After education at the Protestant boarding school in Schiers, he studied medicine at Berne under Kocher and Sahli. Morland received the MD (Berne) with thesis Über die klinische Bedeutung der Opsonine in 1907 and, more importantly for his career, the Federal Diploma allowing him to practise medicine in Switzerland.

He practised as a pulmonary specialist in Switzerland for eleven years (1903–1914) first at Davos and then in Arosa, as director of the Villa Gentiana, a sanatorium for English-speaking patients. At Arosa he was a pioneer of the English colony and helped to build the Anglophone church. During the first year of WWI he served in France as part of a relief unit under the Friends War Victims Relief Committee (FWVRC), but in 1915 went to London and joined the editorial staff of The Lancet.

Morland also edited Maternity and Child Welfare: A Monthly Journal for Workers among Mothers and Children from 1917 to 1934. As editor-in-chief of The Lancet from 1937 to 1944, he was preceded by Sir Samuel Squire Sprigge and succeeded by Theodore F. Fox. Morland was elected in 1930 FRCS and in 1941 FRCP.

Morland and his wife, both Quakers, adopted two sons and a daughter. Egbert Morland came from a Quaker family and had four older brothers. One of his older brothers was Harold Morland, an accountant and auditor, who was Clerk of the Society of Friends from 1927 to 1932.

The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when you’re uncool.

In 2012, Wired contributor Mat Honan got hacked and this year Naoki Hiroshima got hacked. Why? In both cases people wanted to own their short Twitter handles. It’s strange to think that something so trivial and ultimately unimportant caused such a problem and in Honan’s case almost caused him to lose precious data that wasn’t backed up. Social engineering played a big part of the problem that led them to getting hacked and while there’s not a lot you can do about that you can at least make things more difficult on would-be hackers with two factor authentication. Two factor authentication requires something else in addition to a password to get access to something. It may be a text message to your device, an additional piece of information about yourself, a PIN that only you know, etc.

Techcrunch tells us of a site called TwoFactorAuth.org that keeps a list of services that offer two factor authentication and gives you an ability to let the sites that you rely on that don’t offer it that they should.

At a bare minimum, you should ensure that your domain registrar, emailprovider, and cloudproviders are all using it. Controlling a person’s email address gives you the ability to reset their passwords on any number of services and you don’t want people to be able to wipe any files / backups or be able to hold them hostage as was the case with Honan.

Follow-up study of British military hostages and their families held in Kuwait during the Gulf War.
On 2 August 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait and held hostage all its inhabitants. Amongst those forced to stay were 71 British servicemen and their families who were held hostage for up to four and a half months. This study investigated the mental health status of this group of individuals at 6 and 18 months after the final hostage was released. Participants completed the Impact of Event Scale and the 28-item version of the General Health Questionnaire at both 6 and 18 months. In addition they completed a questionnaire regarding background factors, the dimensions of the trauma and the effects of their hostage experience. The Impact of Event Scale scores changed little over time whereas the General Health Questionnaire scores reduced significantly (p = .001) over the 12-month period suggesting that despite ongoing intrusive and avoidance phenomena levels of psychological distress did reduce. Those variables most strongly associated with a poor psychological outcome were witnessing physical violence and perceived deterioration in physical and mental health. Poor outcome at 6 months was strongly correlated with poor outcome at 18 months.

Cold rolled drawn slit cutting steel flat bar is a beam with an I-shaped cross-section. The horizontal elements of the "I" are known as flanges, while the vertical element is termed the "web". Cold rolled drawn slit cutting steel flat bar is usually made of structural steel and is used in construction and civil engineering. The cold rolled drawn slit cutting steel flat bar resists shear forces, while the flanges resist most of the bending moment experienced by the beam. Cold rolled drawn slit cutting steel flat bar theory shows that the I-shaped section is a very efficient form for carrying both bending and shears loads in the plane of the web.. 2.

Are you more creative when you're drunk? It's one of those soundbites that you're liable to hear a friend spout off somewhere between their fourth and fifth beer — a little factoid that might actually sound somewhat feasible if only there were a scientific study lying around to back it up.


Fortunately for you, Jonah Lehrer — master of ceremonies over at Frontal Cortex — has served up a recently published study that proves that being drunk can, in fact, be great for creativity. (As an added bonus, he throws in a second paper that shows the same can be said about being sleepy.)

So how do alcohol and grogginess help you wring as much creative juice out of your brain as possible? According to Lehrer, they both help us "consider irrelevant information... eavesdrop on all the stray associations unfolding in the far reaches of the brain. We are more likely to find the answer because we have less control over where we look." He continues:

A brand-new study by scientists at the University of Illinois at Chicago compared performance on insight puzzles between sober and drunk students. (They were aiming for real intoxication, giving students enough booze to achieve a blood alcohol level of 0.075.) Once the students achieved "peak intoxication" the scientists gave them a battery of word problems – they're known as remote associate tests – that are often solved in a moment of insight. Here's a sample problem. Your task is to find the one additional word that goes with the following triad of words: Cracker Union Rabbit In this case, the answer is "jack." According to the data, drunk students solved more of these word problems in less time. They also were much more likely to perceive their solutions as the result of a sudden insight. And the differences were dramatic: The alcohol made subjects nearly 30 percent more likely to find the unexpected solution.

The ARU had been deciding whether to remove either the Melbourne Rebels or Force but, after a two-week arbitration with RugbyWA, the ARU said they had decided to "discontinue the Western Force Super Rugby license".

The Rugby Union Players Association issued a swift response, declaring the ARU's decision as the abandonment of the game's "national footprint".

Editor's Picks

The Australian Rugby Union [ARU] has removed Western Force from Super Rugby, but is adamant Western Australia won't be abandoned by the 15-man game.

"Today's is the darkest day in the history of Australian Rugby with the custodian of the game confirming their desire to end the tenure of the Western Force and abandoning the game's national footprint."

"The future of professional Rugby in Western Australia will now be the collateral damage of the decision making of the ARU and SANZAAR to expand Super Rugby to a convoluted and complicated 18 team structure against various advice and modelling received which explained the associated risks."

"Players, staff and their families at the Western Force have been put under unprecedented and, quite frankly, completely unreasonable duress throughout this ridiculous and destructive process."

Good-natured teasing is a good tool of learning how to find a nice in a group and adjust.. I find myself to be slightly socially retarded, in that I am frequently unable to tell when someone is joking or teasing. I tend to assume people are being serious by default. But I also think I have a good sense of humor; it's just not the same sense as everyone else seems to have. It's like my brain doesn't pick up on some of these subtle cues.. If humor, intelligence, intellect, or sheer largess of being are used to make a point forcefully then it's a case of bullying. Per me.. Joking and enjoying humor in a group is a healthy part of relating. Absolutely. The more, the better and the more adjusted the person.. Teasing respectfully is a sign of intimacy, I always thought.. it's healthy to learn to relate to others with humor.

The provincial government and Nova Scotia's doctors have reached a new contract agreement that the president of Doctors Nova Scotia believes will bolster recruitment and retention.

The contract, which includes an eight per cent raise over four years and moves family doctors and some specialists to the top of their pay scales in Atlantic Canada, was approved by the membership of Doctors Nova Scotia this week and released Wednesday. About 69 per cent of eligible members voted on the deal, which received 95 per cent support.

Dr. Gary Ernest, president of Doctors Nova Scotia, said having doctors at or near the top of pay scales in Atlantic Canada will help keep doctors in the province and bring back those with ties to here who left for greener financial pastures.

"It going to either equalize us or get us close enough to what people are earning in other provinces that it's going to make people say, 'You know, it's close enough or I'm ahead, I'll come to Nova Scotia,'" he said in an interview.

"The spinoff of that is access for the public."

In total, doctors will get $135 million more by the final year of the deal.

Dr. Gary Ernest is president of Doctors Nova Scotia and a family doctor in Liverpool. (CBC)

Beyond the eight per cent increase, there is an additional $42 million for family and emergency doctors, anesthesiologists, psychiatrists and obstetricians and gynecologists.

Although there have been a variety of shortages in Nova Scotia, psychiatry and anesthesia have been a particular problem for this province and the rest of Canada.

The rural retention bonus will double to $16,000 by the end of the contract, something Ernest, a family doctor in Liverpool, said is particularly significant.

"A lot of the rural specialists are holding together services by their fingernails because of difficulties with resources and they really deserve a lot of credit for working long hours, spending a lot of time on call," he said.

Premier Stephen McNeil says getting the contract signed means doctors and the government can now focus on other aspects of the health-care system. (CBC)

Premier Stephen McNeil said the deal is affordable, leaves room to hire more people if recruitment does increase and should make it easier now to deal with other issues, such as maximizing the use of health-care teams.

"This contract [negotiation] was preventing, in my view, for us to have other conversations," he told reporters in Halifax.

That includes how to have doctors who retire early work on a periodic basis in areas that need extra help, or continue to cover long-term care homes even after closing the rest of their practice.

"Those are the kind of innovative conversations we'll start having now with Doctors Nova Scotia," McNeil said.

He said it was clear more needed to be done for certain doctors because of how competitive recrutiment has become. He noted the overall raise to all doctors is generally in keeping with what's being offered to public servants, while allowing for the fact doctors don't have access to government benefits or pensions.

Other incentives in the deal

The deal includes support for succession planning, which would see a new doctor and retiring doctor be allowed to overlap and work together as they make the transition without interrupting service to patients.

There is a promise to reduce the paperwork burden for things such as securing a locum and there will be increased stipends for doctors mentoring medical students in communities. Those programs have been particularly successful in rural communities and Ernest said the stipend, while only $450 a week, is important.

Family doctors have also secured a pilot program for a new blended capitation payment model, a system in which doctors receive a combination of salary and a fee for services. The model is used in New Brunswick with some success.

Getting to this point has not always been smooth, with doctors in some parts of the province refusing to provide certain services in protest of what they viewed as unfair wage disparities with counterparts in other regions of Nova Scotia. Things become particular tense in Cape Breton when the government gave a raise to hospitalists who focus only on inpatient care.

McNeil and Ernest said they hope terms in the contract intended to address that disparity will be enough to get doctors back to providing all services.

Premier steps in

The nearly year-long negotiations seemed to stall several times and McNeil said he ultimately decided to become directly involved, contacting Ernest so he could get a sense of exactly what challenges doctors were facing.

"He has a very good understanding, quite frankly, of his membership and the concerns that were faced by specialists and how we needed to address those," McNeil said. "And there was give and take, and we landed and we arrived at this point."

Ernest said signing the deal is a positive step toward better relations and collaboration between the two sides.

"The tide has turned. Things are more positive now [and] they will become more positive," he said. "There's a lot of work to do yet, but this is the start; this is the start of a new era, if you will."

McNeil seemed to agree.

"My hope is that this puts us back on solid ground," he said. "My hope is that they recognize we have a fiscal responsibility to the entire province. At the same time, we've recognized and listened to some of the challenges they say were in the system and that this deal is fair to them and fair to taxpayers and addresses some of the issues that the system was ailed by."

The contract comes into effect upon signing, which is expected to happen later this week, and is retroactive to April 1, 2019.

About us

We are the Directorate-General of the European Commission in charge of the policy area known as "Migration and Home Affairs". We manage policies that aim at ensuring that all activities necessary and beneficial to the economic, cultural and social growth of the EU may develop in a stable, lawful and secure environment. More specifically, we work to build an open and safer Europe.

Building a common EU migration and asylum policy

We work to develop a balanced and comprehensive EU migration policy, based on solidarity and responsibility, which - in line with the Europe 2020 strategy - will make an important contribution to the Union's economic development and performance in the longer term. Our aim is to create an EU-wide set of rules for legal migration, while taking into account the interconnection between migration and integration. We also aim to address irregular migration and trafficking in human beings. At the same time, we work to set up a Common European Asylum System, based on solidarity and respect for fundamental rights, to ensure effective protection for the people who need it.

External dimension and funding of the EU home affairs policy

In all these areas, we promote dialogue and cooperation with non-EU countries so that we can work in partnership and jointly tackle common challenges. Our external action contributes to the strengthening of the Union's position as a reliable, active and pragmatic global player, while ensuring the effectiveness of our policies.

To cater for EU interests, whether concerning migration management or security, financial instruments must be at the level of the Union's ambitions. Sound and effective management of these instruments is an essential component of the Migration and Home Affairs policy. We also manage EU financing instruments that support concrete actions in the field of home affairs.

Europe for Citizens

Through this programme we aim to contribute to citizens' understanding of the EU, its history and diversity and foster European citizenship and improve conditions for civic and democratic participation at EU level.

The first customers were given the red carpet treatment with receptions, banquets and performances. Some of the first people said they were delighted to travel to Taiwan, many saying they've waited a long time to come. There's also excitement among Taiwanese who are hoping the influx in tourism will provide an economic boost. This travel service worker says the tourists could bring in millions of extra dollars every year. Small but peaceful groups of pro-Tibetans gathered outside the airport but were kept far enough away by Taiwanese security forces. A lot is at stake because the flights are the first signs of warmer relations between the two countries.. Direct flights between Taiwan and China. Comment

Nice find on the vaders. I have one on the way to me from California. I'm looking for the cape closed standing still vader with mini holo vader now. Him and the boba with flames in front and boba mini holo. You can see the misspelled stand on the leia with it still carded but its tough. The easiest way to tell is that the misspelled stand leia is on the datestamp 52441 and earlier, anything later is the correct stand.

I found both Chewie versions. Am I to assume the small link is the first version, and ultimately be the Harder to find version?

What's everyone else finding on this?

The small link version came after the the large link one according to datestamps but then again the bly with yellow armpits was first then on the next datestamp they had white armpits and then on the next datestamp they switched back to yellow from then on.

i actually found the small link version once way back when this wave was first released. since then, i have come across about 20 different chewies from various stores and all have been the large link version. i was under the impression the small link was much more rare.

KHLIERIAT, Meghalaya -- The National Green Tribunal ban on coal mining and transportation of coal in Meghalaya's Jaintia Hills region has resulted in many of those engaged in the activity switching to turmeric farming for their livelihood.

For the past one year, these coal-miners, who previously practised unscientific mining and transportation of coal, have taken to cultivation of famed curcumin-rich Lakadong turmeric varieties at their villages in East Jaintia Hills District.

D Rymbai, a resident, invested in turmeric cultivation in his six-acre barren land at Moolamylliang village.

Rymbai owned a few coal mines at the village and never thought of farming as a viable alternative to coal mining until April last year when the NGT issued the blanket ban.

"After the NGT ban, I was disillusioned as to what to do for my livelihood. We had become so dependent on coal mining prior to the ban," Rymbai said.

Like Rymbai, almost 90 per cent of the residents of the village were totally dependent on money that came from coal.

Rat-hole coal mining took over in the early 90s and in a span of 20 years, one could see holes dug up everywhere in the village land in search of coal and even paddy fields were not spared.

The April 2014 order of the NGT came as a game changer as people started looking for alternative source of income.

District Horticulture officer G Dohling says that the department has come up with a turmeric hub to promote cultivation of the famed Lakadong variety of turmeric.

The hub was built at a cost of Rs 50 lakh, funds from the 13th Finance Commission, and will benefit the local farmers, he said.

Meghalaya produces over 8,000 MT of turmeric in a year and majority of this production is concentrated in Jaintia Hills and Garo Hills region because of the favourable micro-climatic and soil conditions. .

According to horticulture department officials, there are at least 1,000 farmers engaged in turmeric cultivation and the number is likely to increase.

Jaintia Hills region consisting of two districts produces at least three varieties of turmeric - Lakadong, Laskein and Ladaw, each having their separate identity, a senior horticulture officer said.

The Indian Council for Agricultural Research data shows that the curcumin content of Lakadong variety is 6.0-7.5 per cent, about 2 per cent higher than the turmeric available in the market.

There is a very high demand from the pharmaceutical industry for these curcumin-rich turmeric varieties as it can be used in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and dye/food-colouring industries.

At present ITC Ltd is procuring Lakadong turmeric slices for extracting curcumin used for in its pharmaceutical units.

The Kentucky Wildcats took a break from the grind of fall camp to take a trip to the pool.. Clearly inspired by the diving competition in the Olympics, head coach Joker Phillips attempted a back flip at the 0:27 mark. It had decent form, but the judges will knock a few points off due to the poor entry.. The highlight of the video, without a doubt, is offensive guard Steven Duff. The 6'0", 330-pounder shows off his front flip, and adds in a half twist at the 1:25 mark, and then follows it up with another flip before deciding that flipping is overrated and splashes his teammates.. Wildcat players also showed off their technology and ability to multi-task, taking the camera with them on trips down the slide and off of the diving board.. Breaks like this aren't out of the ordinary during fall camp. Georgia head coach Mark Richt has taken his Bulldogs to the pool in the past, and even back-flipped off the high dive last season.. Way to keep things fun, Kentucky.

Is the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation exam more stressful for the surgeon than emergency department trauma care?
Stress affects surgeons both during training and during professional activity. To compare stress levels affecting surgical residents during the simulated initial assessment and management in the Advanced Trauma Life Support practical exam vs initial assessment and management of trauma patients in the emergency room. Eighteen surgical residents were evaluated under basal conditions, during the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation, and during emergency room initial care. Heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, and diastolic arterial pressure were measured. The Student t test was used to test for differences between means, with statistical significance declared when P < .05. Heart rate and systolic arterial pressure were increased at the beginning and at the end of Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation and emergency room initial care. Diastolic arterial pressure was only increased at the end of the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation. Comparing values obtained during the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation with those obtained during emergency room initial care, heart rate and systolic arterial pressure were significantly higher during the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation both at the beginning and end of the test events. However, diastolic arterial pressure was only significantly higher for Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation compared emergency room at the end of the procedures. These results suggest that the simulation in the practical exam portion of the Advanced Trauma Life Support course is more stressful for the resident surgeon than is the actual initial assessment and care of trauma patients in an emergency room.

Eli Reed Blues Trio. In 2004, Eli “Paperboy” Reed stepped in to a basement studio in Boston, Massachussetts with a few friends and and a plan: To record the combination of Downhome Blues, R&B and Soul that they had been experimenting with in rehearsal and at clubs around the city.. Now, 10 years later, things are quite different. Reed has gone on to become a star on the international Soul scene, with three more full-length albums, many singles and hundreds of live shows around the world under his belt. As the 10 year anniversary of “Walkin’ and Talkin” approached, though, Reed began to think more and more about the magic that happened that day in the studio and that it might be time to revisit it.. Now, with Reed, the three of them are reuniting to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of that classic album with a tour and a vinyl-only reissue. This is a once in a lifetime even to see Eli “Paperboy” Reed return to his Raw Blues roots with just his guitar, his voice and his old friends supporting.

As the farm bill writhes in congressional death throes, Reason magazine reports that more than 170,000 deceased farmers received subsidies between 1999 and 2005. The total cost of these post-mortem outlays? More than $1 billion. Though official policy checks off on subsidies for up to two years after a farmer’s death (if the farm is still operational), a substantial portion of the payments were distributed beyond the time limit. The research originated in a July report by the Government Accountability Office (pdf). Then the shrugging commenced. —Michael Rowe

This was one of my favorite recent bird photos. Getting a sharp close photo of any songbird is usually somewhat of an accomplishment, but capturing one doing something “cutesy” can be especially endearing.. White-throated Sparrow. This photo was largely the result of right time, right place. But composition-wise I knew I wanted a bit of negative space on the right side of the frame, so the image would not appear too crammed. I went with an aperture of F/7.1 to pull some of the vegetation into focus as well as ensure decent sharpness throughout the bird’s body.. Advertisements

What do we think of when we think of siblings? We think of similarity, familiarity and a duality of human nature. In this photo series titled Siblings Azaan Shah brings out these qualities in his photos where similarity of subject matter is captured in a compelling way. The photo series Siblings, which is Azaan's long term project, is inspired by the photographer’s gaze to find a similarity in people and things which we see on a daily basis in the streets in Srinagar. The photos in this series have real-life siblings as subjects or people who somehow, through the photographer's vision, end up having quality of real life siblings.. Azaan Shah is a documentary photographer from downtown Srinagar. Azaan’s photos have been featured in a recently released photo book Witness: Kashmir 1986 – 2016 / Nine Photographers edited by filmmaker Sanjay Kak. The photographs in this series have been shot with a mobile camera and what is remarkable about them is the broad range of human emotions that they are able to convey..

Basil Tea: For Those Who Have Heart. The average human heart pumps up to two thousand gallons of blood a day. In the average lifetime, a person’s heart will pump one million barrels of blood. The heart works hard and never stops until death, making it an organ that everyone should take extra care of. Many factors contribute to cardiovascular health such as diet, exercise, and other lifestyle choices. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people are diagnosed with heart failure. Drinking basil tea can provide the nutrients necessary to avoid falling into that statistic.

With accusations of sexual harassment and worse, the most awful thing someone could put in the article was a woman was reprimanded for almost starting a fire in her living quarters and women are not allowed male visitors or overnight guests (which is in line with their culture and laws and was not uncommon for many groups of women in the U.S.up until not so long ago and I'll bet can still be found in some dormitories at colleges).?

I was pretty sure it should be "female flight attendants," not "woman flight attendants." "Woman" used as an adjective or noun adjunct sounds awkward and derogative to me (the easiest example I can think of is "woman driver"). Then I did a little google and fell into an internet grammar wormhole. Apparently "woman" is often allowed in this context in the style books of reputable news sources. I still don't like it.

Yes, but at such (often but not always religious) schools the policy is nearly already gender-symmetric (except AFAIK schools don't tend to bother to prohibit same sex overnight guests).

Also, the policies are rarely enforced, and frequently have more to do with building security (guests must be registered, etc.) than anything else.

And frankly, I don't understand why we allow college dorms housing what are legally adults, to make any requirements a landlord wouldn't be able to make. Especially when schools have residency requirements or off-campus housing isn't a realistic option.

Different country, though they're close to each other. Part of the Saudi Arabian shoreline is in between, though I've seen on older maps that Qatar and UAE apparently once bordered each other.

As for the working conditions, I always suspected that cruise ships were this way (but I really have nothing to corroborate that).

Speaking of the Arabian Peninsula, I have an old Nat'l Geographic globe from the mid-1960s. UAE was then Trucial States. Oman was Muscat and Oman, and the globe depicts it as narrow shading along the coastline, rather than showing actual boundaries (perhaps to differentiate from Oman proper though the globe isn't quite that old). Part of present-day Yemen was "South Arabia" and is similarly shown as existing only along the coastline.

The US has 1 mio immigrants each year, Qatar has 1.7 mio inhabitants. Here's a batshit idea: the US could offer all Qataris US citizenship, the offer limited to one year. That would sort thing out... Oh wait, is that one of those countries where woman can't get on a plane without signed consent from a male relative?

Boycott Qatar? At least spread the message so that people who go to work there know what they're getting themselves into, and know to send their salary out of the country each month to prevent it being seized. It sounds onerous to work there - but just possibly within the bounds of cultural differences - although the CEO of the airline sounds like an utter jerk. Qatar has different laws and different views about sex before marriage compared to Europe, America or most of the rest of the world. If people from Europe go in with their eyes open and take the view that it's a useful training experience and something to do for a year or two to get a line on their CV before moving on to a European or US (or anywhere else in the world) airline with proper working practices and employer relations, for some people it could be a tolerable experience.

That's not meaningful. They get their revenue from sources other than their airlines, and frankly the two dozen white people who do aren't going to have any impact.

Since when is a boycott an effective measure in a global economy? That's been the whole point of globalization- the demobilization of local and culturally specific factors inhibiting trade. Boycotts are the actions of the lazy and the impotent. Not that I have anything against the impotent, we're all largely impotent- but I'm against the delusion that we accomplish anything by specific inaction.

Qatar is the venue for the 2022 Football World Cup which, for those of you who know anything about football, is a big thing. If they want to host one of the biggest sporting events in the World they should expect people to start to look at them closely. I suspect this article will be the first of many. Whether it changes anything... well, I hope so.

Increased CNTF levels in adults with autism spectrum disorders.
Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a neurotrophin which could signal neuronal suffering and at the same time acts as a neuroprotective agent. In the present study we aimed to evaluate CNTF serum levels in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In fact, considering the role of CNTF as a neuronal damage signal and the role of neuroinflammation, excito-inhibitory imbalance and excitotoxicity in the pathogenesis of ASDs, a possible alteration of CNTF in ASDs could be hypothesised. We recruited 23 individuals with ASDs and intellectual disability (ID), 20 ID subjects and 26 typical adults. A complete medical and psychopathological characterisation of the participants was performed. CNTF serum levels were measured with ELISA. CNTF serum levels were significantly higher in the ASD + ID group compared to ID (p < .001) or typically developed subjects (p < .001). CNTF may be considered as a potential biomarker candidate for ASDs in the context of severe ID. Our results support the hypothesis of neurotrophic imbalance in ASDs.

The pan-European fiber operator Interoute added a bit more fiber to its network at its southern frontier this morning. They've added a new route to the rest of Europe from their landing stations in Mazaro del Vallo on the island of Sicily and Bari on the Adriatic Sea.. That's the toe and the heel of the boot for those with a more visual image of Italy, and the new route follows the southern coastline while adding 1,300 route kilometers of fiber. It provides new diversity to those submarine cables that land there rather then go all the way up to Marseilles, supplying three new 100G routes back to the rest of Interoute's European fiber network.. More of Interoute's focus lately has gone toward its cloud services, so it's nice to see a bit of news on the fiber side. They did also make an inorganic move up in the UK with the purchase of Vtesse last year, giving them deeper British reach.. Discuss this Post

1. Field of the Invention
This invention is concerned with improvements in machines for conforming portions of shoe uppers to the shapes of their corresponding lasts.
2. Prior Art
Various proposals have been made to provide automatic or semi-automatic shoe machines for lasting side portions of shoes which require little or no attention by a machine operator apart from presentation of the shoe and removal of the shoe from the machine. It has been proposed to load and unload machines by an automatic shoe presenting and removing device. Some of the proposed machines employ helically ribbed wiping rolls for wiping marginal portions of an upper of a shoe assembly. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,591,878, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, discloses a shoe machine having independently mounted wiping rolls for performing a side lasting operation simultaneously along the opposite side portions of a shoe assembly. The wiping rolls are displaced widthwise of the shoe assembly in accordance with variations of outline shape of the shoe bottom, utilizing template means for controlling the widthwise displacement of the wiping rolls as they operate progressively along the shoe bottom. The U.S. Pat. No. 3,908,216, also assigned to the assignee of the present invention, discloses a shoe machine having lasting rolls which are arranged to simultaneously wipe marginal portions of opposite sides of the upper of a shoe assembly so that the upper and insole become secured together by adhesive applied therebetween. Means for effecting relative movement lengthwise between the lasting rolls and the shoe supporting means causes the rolls to operate progressively along side portions of the shoe assembly. Each of the lasting rolls has a wiping element disposed helically about a circumferential portion of the roll. The lasting rolls are supported by roll-carrying means that extend at least substantially widthwise of the shoe assembly being operated upon. The roll-carrying means are capable of arcuate movement about an axis extending generally lengthwise of the bottom of the shoe assembly. The side lasting rolls of the machine just referred to are of sufficient length to operate upon the marginal portions of the upper without widthwise displacement of the rolls. The specification of U.S. Pat. No. 3,971,089, again also assigned to the assignee of the present invention, describes a machine which is generally similar but which has means for changing the angle included between the axes of the two lasting rolls at the opposite sides of the shoe to suit it to different transverse curvatures of different portions of the shoe bottom.
Various proposals have been made to combine lasting of a shank portion of a shoe assembly with a heel seat lasting operation on the shoe assembly in a single machine which would effect a reduction of manpower as compared with a two-machine system requiring two operators. While some success has been achieved by the use of the combined machines, the machines have had certain limitations as to the extent of the side lasting operations. Some of the proposals have required a considerable amount of adjustment of the lasting arrangement by the machine operator and are not fully automatic machines.
One of the various objects of the present invention is to provide an improved shoe machine having heel seat lasting and side lasting arrangements which are capable of automatically lasting the whole of the side and seat portions of a shoe assembly heelwardly of the portion lasted by a pulling over and toe lasting machine.

Multiple Tornadoes Confirmed Saturday Across the Area, Damage Reported. By: David Shepherd, Director of News & Public Information / Photo Submitted By: Neil Forler. TELL CITY -- The National Weather Service has confirmed multiple tornadoes touched down in the area Saturday.. An EF – 0 hit Main Street in Tell City, damaging roofs and bending an amateur radio tower.. A tree blew onto a garage in town and multiple large trees were downed.. The twister had peak winds between 70 mph – 80 mph and was on the ground for just under two miles before breaking up at the northern end of Quaker Road.. An EF-1 tornado also touched down in Stanley in neighboring Warrick County.. That one packed winds of 110 mph and cut a 2 and a quarter mile path, blowing out a wall of a home and damaging roofs and crops.. An EF 0 tornado was also confirmed in Hancock County, Kentucky.. Luckily, no injuries reported in any of Saturday’s tornadoes.

Q:

From FullyName string to Type object

Anyone know how to get a Type object from a FullName?
Eg. 
string fullName = typeof(string).FullName; 
Type stringType = <INSERT CODE HERE> 
Assert.AreEqual(stringType, typeof(string) 

A:

string fullName = typeof(string).FullName; 
Type stringType = Type.GetType(fullName);

However, note that this only searches the calling assembly and core MS assemblies. It is better to use either the AssemblyQualifiedName, of find the Assembly first, and use Assembly.GetType(fullName).
Either:
string qualifiedName = typeof(string).AssemblyQualifiedName;
Type stringType = Type.GetType(qualifiedName);

or
Assembly a = typeof(SomeOtherTypeInTheSameAssembly).Assembly;
Type type = a.GetType(fullName);

Update re comments; note that AssemblyQualifiedName includes versioning information; this is fine for use in things like configuration files, but if (as is the case here) you are using this for persistance, it is often better to use an implementation independent contract. For example, xml (via XmlSerializer or DataContractSerializer) is not concerned about the specific types, as long as the layout is correct.
If space is an issue, binary formats are often shorter - but BinaryFormatter includes type metadata, and isn't platform independent (try consuming it from java, for example). In such cases, you might want to look at custom serializers such as protobuf-net, which is contract-based, but using Google's "protocol buffers" cross-platform wire format.

Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight released two videos on Friday reaffirming his support for President Donald Trump, who he called "the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln."

Addressing the videos to the "people of the Republican Party," Voight praised Trump's job efforts, which he claims has been difficult, "for [Trump's] battling the left and their absurd words of destruction."

"I'm here today to acknowledge the truth, and I'm here today to tell you, my fellow Americans, that our country is stronger, safer, and with more jobs because our president has made his every move correct," Voight said.



"Don't be fooled by the political left because we are the people of this nation that is witnessing triumph," he continued. "So let us stand with our president, let us stand for this truth that President Trump is the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln. God bless America, and may God continue to guide this nation."

Voight is one of Hollywood's most outspoken conservative voices. He was also one of Trump's earliest Hollywood supporters, who has continued to support the president more than two years into Trump's first term.

During an inauguration event at the Lincoln Monument in Jan. 2017, Voight said that "God answered all our prayers" with Trump's election.

"And President Lincoln, who sits here with us ... I'm sure is smiling knowing America will be saved by an honest and good man who will work for all the people, no matter their creed or color," Voight said, according to The Hill.

Permeable pavement helps water soak into your property!. Choosing the Right Permeable Hardscape. The first step to creating pavement that is permeable is to choose an option that matches the space given for the project and the budget that is being utilized. Some types of pavement include:. - Permeable pavers, which are similar to traditional stone pavers, but have special gaps filled with small stones that allow water to seep into the ground.. - A plastic or concrete grid system, in which the gaps are filled with gravel or grasses for easy infiltration.. - A porous asphalt, porous pavement (local company!) or pervious concrete, which is a lower cost option, that allows water to flow through final example and a lower cost option.. 1 Comment:. By Odette Iskander 08 Aug 2018. I like the idea of permeable pavement a lot. Unfortunately, I currently live in a condo and can’t exercise that option. I will mention to friends who may be paving.

TMZ has obtained a copy of a defamation lawsuit Stern just filed in L.A. County Superior Court. He claims Hatten -- the sister of Anna Nicole Smith's crazy ex-con ex-boyfriend Mark -- fed lies to Cosby, including the one that Stern gave lip service to Larry B ... in a Paris Hilton kind of way. Cosby's already been sued for publishing the allegation ... et tu, Jackie.. And there's more ... Stern is also suing Mark Speer, the dude Debra Opri hired to bodyguard Birkhead. Larry fired Speer, and Stern claims the scorned heavy then made up lies, which he spoon fed to Cosby. The alleged lies include claims that Stern was stealing money from Anna and striking back door deals with Birkhead over Dannielynn.. Stern is suing Hatten and Speer for unspecified damages.. BTW, Mark Hatten was busted for DUI today.

J. J. Thomson and the Existence of the Electron. On April 30, 1897, English physicist Joseph John Thomson gave the first experimental proof of the electron, which had been already theoretically predicted by Johnstone Stoney. Thomson was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the electron and for his work on the conduction of electricity in gases. Joseph John Thomson was born in 1856 in Manchester, England and was taught mainly in private schools at the beginning. In 1876,…Read more

We just released our new forums!. Either option can be correct depending on your particular situation. I think, for the normal citizen, in a self defense situation, a lazer would be a total waste. More than likely what the person would be doing is pulling their weapon, pointing, and shooting as quickly as possible. Now law enforcement or security guards may have a different perspective on the need for a lazer. To me the normal self defense situation is; up close, sudden, pull your weapon, point and shoot. There isn't going to be any time to take a proper stance and use your sights. If you have not maintained situational awareness, you may not even have time to pull your weapon. Your propbably going to be shooting from positions you've never dreamt of. If I thought any different, I would never carry my S&W Bodyguard .380. Hitting anything, with any other than the first shot, at any distance of ten feet or more with that gun is an adventure to say the least.

Courts consider company advisers, such as investment banks, to be "abettors," making them immune to securities-fraud class actions. But in the Enron case, the investment banks still may be vulnerable. Here's why:. 1. The bankers took stakes in off-balance-sheet partnerships they created that helped Enron hide debt. Plaintiffs will try to prove that they are "instigators" of fraud, not just abettors.. 2. Private partnership documents show that banks knew Enron's finances were shaky, but their underwriting filings on debt issues sold to the public suggest otherwise. Plaintiffs will claim the filings were fraudulent.. 3. Document discovery may produce further embarrassing revelations.. Data: Legal documents, BusinessWeek

I used the filter shown below:. Position of active player exactly 9. Raised Preflop any 2Bet. Raised First in. Players dealt into hand between 3 and 10. I wanted to look at bvb results when I was in the SB vs specific opponents in the BB when I raise first in.. When I run this filter I can look at specific opponent stats - vs a certain opponent it says I won 7 hands and lost 90.. However, when I click on that player and look through all the hands I won 80 hands and lost 90. It's way undercounting my stats. It's also showing (in the top box summary) that I won $200 and lost $2,000, but when I look down at individual hands my amount won is way undercounted.. Am I doing something wrong or is it displaying info incorrectly?

Q:

Safe Home Network through WiFi

Maybe this is such an obvious question that it's a duplicate.
I have Ubuntu 10.10 on both my PC and Laptop. The Laptop connects to the Internet through a WiFi router. The PC connects to the same router with an Ethernet cable.
How can I safely share files between my PC and Laptop through this router? Do I have to change the router's config?
I'll need SSL as the WiFi is open at this moment, but I guess I can find info about that without a problem. Once I've done that, network printing should be easy :)
Edit Updated both to 11.10. Activated DHCP on the router to fix the IP addresses of both computers and the router now uses WPA2. I haven't been able to set up NFS between the computers, but I did achieve a safe FTP server connection.

A:

For this you need sftp
Firstly install ssh on all three computers
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
and find the ip of the computer using these commands:
sudo ifconfig | grep -o "inet addr:[0-9.]*" | cut -d ":" -f 2 | grep -v ^127

On the other computers do so in nautilus:

Click connect and bookmark it like this

Similarly do the same for the other machines use the bookmarks to nagivate the other computers

A:

On each computer install the ssh package.
Then you can mount the filesystem over SFTP (stands for Ssh File Transfer Protocol) in nautilus and copy that way just like you would between drives. To access files on the other computer, open nautilus and Clik the File -> Connect to server... menu. Pick ssh from the menu/list. Put in your username for the other computer and the IP for the other computer and click connect. It should ask for your password for the laptop username you put in and then it should show the files on the laptop. (You can do this in either direction.)
This method encrypts the whole thing both ways so it is safe even over open wifi (or if you use strong passwords) even over the internet. 
You can find out the IP of a computer by running ifconfig on it. It will give you something like this:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:11:11:9e:58:57  
          inet addr:192.168.1.15  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

          RX bytes:348505532 (348.5 MB)  TX bytes:127490351 (127.4 MB)

lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
          RX packets:68246 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:68246 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

          RX bytes:35179159 (35.1 MB)  TX bytes:35179159 (35.1 MB) 

Look for a line that says 'inet addr:192.168.###.###' (that does not start with 127.0.) and that is the IP address. So for the example ifconfig output I listed, it would be 192.168.1.15   This would be the address I would use to connect to the computer I ran ifconfig on.

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) -
Home loan rates rose in anticipation that the Federal Reserve will raise rates sooner, and faster, than many market watchers expect, mortgage financier Freddie Mac said Thursday.

"All eyes will be on the Fed for the next few months at least. How aggressive or how measured the coming rate hikes are will determine the future direction of both short- and long-term mortgage rates," said Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist.

For the week ended June 11, the rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 6.30 percent, with an average 0.7 point payable up front, up slightly from the previous week when it averaged 6.28, according to Freddie Mac.

Last year at this time, the 30-year averaged 5.21 percent.

The 15-year mortgage advanced to 5.67 percent from last week's 5.63 percent, with 0.7 point payable up front. A year ago, it was 4.60 percent.

The one-year adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) averaged 4.14 percent, up from 3.98 percent the previous week, with 0.7 point payable up front. A year earlier it averaged 3.54 percent.

"The 1-year ARM responds more directly to movements by the Fed," said Nothaft. "And market chatter has it that the Fed will not only raise rates at the end of this month, but may do so consecutively throughout the rest of the year."

"News like that is good news for keeping long-term fixed-rate mortgage rates low since those are more sensitive to inflationary expectations."

Freddie Mac's average mortgage rates are based on a survey of 125 lenders nationwide.

Freddie Mac (FRE: up $0.55 to $60.32, Research, Estimates), or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., is a publicly traded company the government established in 1970 to provide a flow of funds to mortgage lenders. It buys mortgages from banks, bundles them and then resells them as mortgage-backed securities.

Its products, and the products of other similar entities, have become popular as an alternative to government-backed bonds, notably with international investors.

Biodegradation of methyl violet by Pseudomonas mendocina MCM B-402.
Pseudomonas mendocina MCM B-402 was found to utilize a triphenylmethane dye, methyl violet as the sole source of carbon when incorporated in synthetic medium. Almost complete decolorization of methyl violet by P. mendocina was observed within 48 h of incubation at ambient temperature (28 +/- 2 degrees C) under aerated culture conditions, when the bacteria were inoculated into Davis Mingioli's synthetic medium at a concentration of 100 mg/l medium. Methyl violet was mineralized to CO2 through three unknown intermediate metabolites and phenol. The decolorization of the dye involved demethylation.

3rd Annual Aggie Wallace Bagpipe Competition

For the third time in many years, there will be a bagpipe competition at this year’s Highland Festival and Games. All pipers whatever ages and playing abilities are invited to come and participate. You will enter the competition at the Festival.

The competition is named for Aggie Wallace who is recognized as the first individual who trained and organized Hawaii residents in the art of playing the bagpipe and organized them into the first local bagpipe band. Aggie came to Hawaii in 1938 on the invitation of E.K. Fernandez who immediately put her to work with his traveling carnival. She was born in Canada, the daughter of a Pipe Major, emigrated to Canada with her family and ended up playing on Vaudeville and in Hollywood where she met E.K. and the rest is history.

Pipers will be judged on their abilities as it relates to the playing of marches, strathspays, and reels and the traditional music of the pipes, piobaireachd.

This competition has been made possible because of generous support from the Celtic Pipes and Drums of Hawaii, the Hawaii Scottish Association and from Kim Greeley, who was a student of Aggie Wallace.

Architecture of Johannesburg

Johannesburg is the capital of the Gauteng province and the financial hub of South Africa. Founded in 1886, the city is located in the Witwatersrand region, which has vast gold deposits. The town experienced rapid growth as the gold deposits were exploited, and is now South Africa's largest urban center. As a result, the Johannesburg area has a wide variety of architecture, from early Art Nouveau to Postmodern buildings. Hillbrow, for example, contains many buildings constructed since the 1950s, including the Hillbrow Tower.

Notable buildings
Johannesburg features a variety of commercial and residential buildings, so there are also a few modern buildings such as the KwaDukuza eGoli Hotel and the Trust Bank Building. The Johannesburg-Pretoria combined metropolitan area has the densest concentration of skyscrapers on the continent and one of the densest in the world.

Carlton Centre is a skyscraper and shopping center located in downtown Johannesburg, South Africa. At 223 meters (730 ft), it is the tallest building in Africa and about half the height of the Willis Tower (the former Sears Tower) in Chicago. It was the tallest building in the southern hemisphere when originally completed. The Carlton Centre has 50 floors and is 223m tall, about 40m short of featuring in the world's top 100 skyscrapers. The foundations of the two buildings in the complex are 3.5m in diameter and extend 20m down to the bedrock, 30m below street level. The building houses both offices and shops and has over 46 percent of the floor area below ground level.[1] A viewing deck on the 50th floor offers views of Johannesburg and Pretoria.
Ponte City Apartments is a skyscraper in the Hillbrow neighborhood of Johannesburg, South Africa. It was built in 1975 to a height of 173 m (567.6 ft), making it the tallest residential skyscraper in Africa. The 54-story building is cylindrical, with an open center allowing additional light into the apartments. The center space is known as "the core" and rises above an uneven rock floor. Ponte City was an extremely desirable address for its views over all of Johannesburg and its surroundings. The sign on top of the building is the highest and largest sign in the southern hemisphere. It currently advertises the South African mobile phone company Vodacom.
Marble Towers is a skyscraper in the Central Business District of Johannesburg, South Africa. It was built in 1973 and is 32 stories tall. The building has an eight-story parking garage attached to it. It has the biggest electronic sign in the Southern Hemisphere, measuring 44 meters by 32 meters by 12 meters. It is made out of a mixture of concrete and marble. Its main use is for commercial offices.
KwaDukuza eGoli Hotel is a skyscraper in the Central Business District of Johannesburg, South Africa. The complex, built in 1970 originally as "The Tollman Towers" (owned by the prominent South African family), were two separate towers, one 40 stories and the other 22, linked by a four-story podium with a pool deck and a running track. The building was empty for many years as the hotel, The Johannesburg Sun, relocated to Sandton. The building was then converted to a Holiday Inn, which also quickly failed. The new KwaDukuza eGoli Hotel opened in 2001 when it hosted 3000 police officers for the world summit on sustainable development, it was owned Mark Whitehead of Whitehead Enterprises, then also soon went out of business. The building is currently "mothballed."
Sandton City is a shopping center located in Sandton, Johannesburg that was built as a pioneer center in 1973. The tower was built as part of a business park for downtown Sandton, a suburb of Johannesburg. Liberty Properties announced in 2008 that Sandton City would receive an R1.77 billion upgrade. Liberty Properties Chief Executive Samuel Ogbo envisaged the complex as South Africa's very own Wall Street The redevelopment will include the construction of a 60-story office tower, new retail and office space and residential apartments. The extension will stretch to 30 000 m2 and the total complex will have a gross lettable area of 158 000 m2.
Trust Bank Building is a skyscraper in the Central Business District of Johannesburg, South Africa. It was built in 1970 to a height of 140 meters. The building is the former head office of Trust Bank of South Africa, and as such has one of the largest bank vaults in South Africa. The building was recently sold in February 2003 for Rand 6.4 million (USD $640.000), which may prompt the name to be changed to that of the new tenant.
11 Diagonal Street is a skyscraper in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was built in 1984 to a height of 80 meters. It is designed to look like a diamond as it reflects different views of the Central Business District from each angle of the building.

Speaking to reporters after Kejriwal announced that the Odd-Even scheme will be back from November 4-15, Gadkari said: "I don't think it is necessary. We have made a new Ring Road, and with that Delhi's pollution has come down a lot. And in my estimate in two years...Rs 50,000 crore has been provided by my department, and the Yamuna Clean Water and Clean Air Scheme are going on, and with that in two years Delhi will be pollution-free.". Gadkari said it is up to the Delhi government to implement the scheme.. Kejriwal said that 1,000 electric buses will be introduced in the national capital and that a bus aggregator policy will be announced soon.. "If you enforce Odd-Even for a long time, the implementation becomes troublesome. As of now, Odd-Even will only be restricted to this time frame," said Kejriwal.. He also asserted that Supreme Court guidelines during Diwali on firecrackers will be sternly enforced. Kejriwal also urged the people of Delhi to take part in tree plantation drives.

Follow Follow

"Follow Follow" is a song sung by supporters of Rangers, a football club in Glasgow, Scotland. It is based upon the revivalist hymn "Follow On".

Club usage
The song has been adopted by Rangers as their club anthem. In 2007 Rangers used the song as an inspiration for the title of their initiative against unacceptable behaviour at football matches, Follow With Pride, to replace their Pride Over Prejudice campaign.  There is also a Rangers fanzine named after the song. It is also called Follow Follow and was banned from being sold outside Ibrox Stadium due to having printed articles with a sectarian related content. It moved to an online message board which is now the leading Rangers fansite.

Controversy 
The song has gathered an amount of controversy after some fans started to sing alternative lyrics about the Pope and the Vatican City that are considered sectarian.

In 1999 Rangers' vice-chairman Donald Findlay had to stand down from his position and resign from the club's board after being filmed singing "Follow Follow" (with these alternative lyrics) and "The Sash". The Faculty of Advocates (the professional body to which Findlay belonged) found his actions were "likely to bring the faculty into disrepute" and fined him £3,500.

In 2009, Linda Gillies was investigated by police after West Lothian Council received a complaint after her parrot was heard whistling "Follow Follow", to the chagrin of some of her neighbours. The complaint was eventually dismissed by the council and no charges were brought against Gillies.

Lyrics
The lyrics are:

Though the straits be broad or narrow, follow we will,
Follow we will, follow we will,
If the straits be broad or narrow, follow we will,
We will follow in the footsteps of our team. [God bless them]
Follow follow, we will follow Rangers,
Everywhere, anywhere,
We will follow on,
Dundee, Hamilton, Aberdeen and back again
If they go to Dublin we will follow on.

For there's not a team like the Glasgow Rangers,
No not one, and there never shall be one,
Celtic know all about their troubles,
We will fight till the day is done.
For there's not a team like the Glasgow Rangers,
No not one, and there never shall be one!

I went to my old friend last Tuesday. She and her husband were my really good friends over the years. Her husband was my hubby's best friend. I miss them so much! i really wanted to tell them everything about what's going on to our lives. I love to talk to them and i admire them so much because they have been together for so many years and they never had any major problems with each other. Until i found out that her husband is having an affair. I'm still thinking if i should tell it right away or should i wait?. in transition. 2 years ago. 2 comments:.

Recommendation Reports

Northeast of Fogal Road and The Gore Road – Council had approved, in principle in June 2014, a proposed development consisting of retail buildings, some of which have already been built. The conditions include gaining access to Region of Peel service. They weren’t able to gain permission by November 2015 and got an extension. However, they have made progress and will be gaining access soon, allowing them to build the rest of the development (page 140)

8863 The Gore Road – final approval of a development in principle, as long as the associated case at the Ontario Municipal Board be dismissed. Development includes 113 single detached units, 161 townhouses, a medium/high density residential block, an employment/office building block, and associated infrastructure like open space, parks, and roads. Original proposal was all residential on employment lands, but has now been shifted to half residential (north side), half offices (south side fronting on Queen Street). It should be noted that the residential apartment/condo building and office developments haven’t actually been designed (page 157).

Abstract

Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) is a non-native invasive tree that is of particular concern in the Southeastern United States. It has become naturalized in a variety of habitats and can be found in monospecific stands. The use of tallow woodlands by overwintering birds is poorly documented. I compared use of tallow woodlands to use of bottomland hardwood forests by birds in the Mermentau River Basin, Louisiana. Species richness and evenness were greater in the bottomland hardwood sites. Three species were more abundant in tallow woodlands, six species were more common in bottomland hardwoods, and six species exhibited no difference between habitats. Information-theory methodology was used to determine the relative importance of woodland type and certain landscape variables to species richness and bird abundance. Model-averaged parameter estimates and relative Akaike weights were calculated. In most cases, woodland type was a better predictor of species richness and abundance than percent forest cover, distance to nearest forest patch, or the number of forest patches within 1 km. Energy assimilation of tallow fruit by captive birds was measured to determine if apparent metabolizable energy differed between bird species and plant species. Assimilation of tallow fruit pulp differed significantly between birds. Yellow-rumped Warblers (Dendroica coronata) exhibited the highest assimilation of tallow, followed by American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and then Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis). Yellow-rumped Warblers, which where more common in the tallow woodlands, were able to metabolize tallow fruit more effectively than wax myrtle (Morella cerifera) and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) fruit. Metabolization of wax myrtle and poison ivy fruit did not differ significantly. Cardinals metabolized deciduous holly fruit (Ilex decidua) more efficiently than either hackberry (Celtis laevigata) or tallow. Overall, bottomland hardwoods supported more bird species and exhibited a higher measure of species evenness. Tallow may provide an alternate food source for some species and could potentially influence the local winter distribution of Yellow-rumped Warblers.

Donate. © AFP 2017/ KIM JAE-HWAN. US President Donald Trump has found a way to thrive on tensions with North Korea.. The US president claimed on Tuesday that the US would allow South Korea and Japan to buy more “highly sophisticated” US military equipment in response to the so-called North Korea threat.. I am allowing Japan & South Korea to buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 5 September 2017. Trump did not reveal what kind of equipment he had in mind. However, the White House said the president was willing to approve the sale of “many billions of dollars’ worth of military weapons and equipment” to South Korea.. Trump’s statement followed North Korea’s six nuclar test that took place on Sunday. The US president also claimed that the US was ready to use its “nuclear capabilities” to defend itself and its allies.. Donate

Jill and I continued our tour around Pit 1 and were able to see more of the warriors that were getting excavated and refurbished.. We didn’t hire a guide, since we were in a rush and didn’t want to bargain.. Yes, everything in China is a bargaining event and it gets very tiring.. Sometimes we just want to pay a fair price and be done with it so we just give up and don’t bother.. Imagine living each day as if you were going into a car dealership and having to bargain for a lot of what you want.. It tends to make us cynical and jaded and we, therefore, don’t have as much interaction as we normally would with others.. So, we skipped the tour guide and I wish we hadn’t because I would have liked to know why they are wrapped in cellophane.. Our guess was they were being glued back together and this allows them to hold until the glue settles but we aren’t sure.. Either way, walking around the back of the exhibit was a wonderful way to end our visit to the Terracotta Army.. This slideshow requires JavaScript.

The present invention relates to electrocatalyst compositions. More specifically, the invention relates to electrocatalysts which can be used on the anode of a fuel cell to oxidize alcohol.
A fuel cell is an electrochemical device with an anode and a cathode that converts chemical energy provided by a fuel and an oxidant into electricity. An electrolyte is required which is in contact with both electrodes and which may be alkaline, acidic, solid or liquid. The basic process is highly efficient and essentially pollution-free. Also, since single fuel cells can be assembled in stacks of varying sizes, systems can be designed to produce a wide range of output levels.
As an energy conversion device, the fuel cell is distinguished from a conventional battery by its fuel storage capacity. Unlike a battery which consumes internally stored fuel and needs to be either discarded or recharged after a certain time, fuel is fed to the fuel cell from an external source giving the fuel cell a practically unlimited storage capacity. Also, the fuel cell is distinguished from a battery in that its electrodes are catalytically active.
Current is generated by reaction on the fuel cell electrode surfaces, which are in contact with an electrolyte. The fuel is oxidized at the anode and gives up electrons to an external electrical load. The oxidant accepts electrons and is reduced at the cathode. Ionic current through an electrolyte completes the circuit.
In many fuel cell systems, a hydrogen fuel is produced by converting a hydrocarbon-based fuel such as methane, or an oxygenated hydrocarbon fuel such as methanol, to hydrogen in a process called reforming. This reformate fuel contains, in addition to hydrogen, high levels of carbon dioxide; usually around 25%. The reformate fuel also contains small amounts of impurities, such as carbon monoxide, typically at levels of around 1%.
Other fuel cells, called "direct" or "non-reformed" fuel cells oxidize fuel high in hydrogen content directly, without the hydrogen first being separated by a reforming process. It has been known since the 1950s that lower primary alcohols, particularly the C1-C5 alcohols, can be oxidized directly (i.e., without reformation to H.sub.2 +CO or H.sub.2 +CO.sub.2) at the anode of a fuel cell. Methanol and ethanol are particularly useful.
Because compactness is critical to the commercial viability of utilizing a fuel cell as an energy source in such items as electric automobiles, the ability to oxidize alcohol as a fuel directly without having to also utilize a reformer is important. Serious drawbacks have also been encountered in the storage of hydrogen for use in fuel cells. Thus, a "direct" fuel cell, such as a methanol fuel cell, is advantageous in that it is compact and no energy is used up in reformation. Further, the fuel is easily stored in liquid form, is high in hydrogen content, is highly reactive in a fuel cell, and is economically viable.
In a typical methanol fuel cell, methanol is oxidized to produce electricity, heat, water, and carbon dioxide. The goal in methanol fuel processing is complete methanol oxidation for maximum energy generation shown in the equation: EQU Anode: CH.sub.3 OH+H.sub.2 O.fwdarw.CO.sub.2 +6H.sup.+ +6e.sup.- EQU Cathode: O.sub.2 +4e+4H.sup.+.fwdarw.2H.sub.2 O (1) EQU Net: 2CH.sub.3 OH+3O.sub.2.fwdarw.4H.sub.2 O+CO.sub.2.
In the absence of an electrocatalyst, a typical electrode reaction occurs, if at all, only at very high overpotentials. Thus, the oxidation and reduction reactions require catalysts in order to proceed at useful rates. Catalysts that promote the rates of electrochemical reactions, such as oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation in a fuel cell are often referred to as electrocatalysts. Electrocatalysts are important because the energy efficiency of any cell is determined, in part, by the overpotentials necessary at the cell's anode and cathode.
Platinum (Pt), an expensive metal, is the best catalyst for many electrochemical reactions, including methanol oxidation. A major obstacle in the development of methanol fuel cells is the loss of electrochemical activity of even the best electrocatalyst due to "poisoning" by carbon monoxide (CO). CO is an intermediate in the oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2). The CO molecule is strongly adsorbed on the electroactive surface of the electrode, obstructing the oxidation of new fuel molecules. It is well known that CO, even at levels of 1-10 ppm, is a severe poison to platinum electrocatalysts and significantly reduces fuel cell performance.
Various attempts have been made to find a solution to the CO poisoning problem. For example, Reddy et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,132,193 discloses the use of gold crystals for the oxidation of alcohol. Yepez, U.S. Pat. No. 5,804,325, discloses the use of deliberately occluded hydrogen in the anode to chemisorb the poisons. Various combinations of metals have also been employed as an electrocatalyst material in an attempt to avoid or minimize the CO poisoning problem. For example, Ma et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,836 discloses an electrocatalyst obtained by combining platinum oxides and iron oxides to form Pt/Fe particles in a colloidal solution.
In spite of the foregoing, prior attempts to solve the problem of CO poisoning at the anode of methanol fuel cells have been unsuccessful. Prior attempts to avoid the problem have proven to be too expensive, ineffective, or impractical to be commercially viable. Thus, there remains a need for electrocatalysts that are resistant to CO poisoning and can be used on the anode for alcohol oxidation in fuel cells.

Fremantle Kids & Family Entertainment, a division of FremantleMedia Enterprises, hopes to build upon the success that "Tree Fu Tom" experienced during its first year in the U.K. The highly rated preschool series, which airs on CBeebies and is a co-production with the BBC channel, debuted in mid-April in the U.S. on the Sprout network.

According to Bob Higgins, executive vice president, Fremantle Kids & Family Entertainment, the strategy is to aggressively develop and establish Tree Fu Tom in the marketplace as a true global preschool property. Higgins believes that the series has all of the elements to accomplish this goal, from an incredible story line to high-quality animation to an extensive consumer products program that launched earlier this year in the U.K. and will eventually make its way to the U.S. in the fall.

"We wanted each episode to feel like a mini-movie, which I think we have succeeded in doing," says Higgins. "We have that cinematic feel in a preschool show, and that is what is now clicking with the audience who are so used to watching high-quality movies. Today's kids are very sophisticated, and you do not have to dumb it down."

Fremantle is aggressively selling the preschool educational series internationally with several major deals in more than a dozen countries including France (Lagardere), Australia/New Zealand (Disney), Israel (HopTV), Eastern Europe (Minimax), Korea (EBS), Brunei (RTB) and throughout Latin America (Discovery Kids). The series has already been sold to Italy (Switchover Media), Canada (Knowledge Network/BBC Kids), Norway (NRK), Belgium (VRT-Ketnet) and Finland (YLE).

Tree Fu Tom is unquestionably a cornerstone of FME's Kids & Family Entertainment group, which was formed three years ago when Higgins, along with Sander Schwartz, president of the division, were recruited to establish the company as a global player in kids' entertainment.

FME recently signed a five-year partnership agreement with BBC to develop additional children's TV shows, which is clearly reflective of the Kids & Family Entertainment division's commitment to global expansion.

From the time Fremantle partnered with BBC to co-produce the series two years ago, all of the pieces of the program development and broadcast launch quickly fell into place.

"We brought in new writers, a new design style and we kept the essence of bringing magic into kids' homes and allowing them to participate in the show and the basic idea of this character's adventures going into a fantasy world."

"Tree Fu Tom's" educational, interactive story line, which is targeted to 4- to 6-year-olds, is based on the magical superhero, Tom, and his best friend Twigs, plus a host of other characters and creatures in a fantasy world called Treetopolis. Blue Zoo Animation does the CGI animation.

"The magic–'tree fu'–is kind of like kung fu, with a movement and chant that goes along with it, which is what happens when Tom does his magic," explains Higgins. "We are trying to get kids up off the couch and doing the spells along with him because when the story hits a certain point for Tom to handle alone, he asks the audience for help. It's all about focusing on kids fine motor skills."

"While the skew is for boys, the ratings show it is very close to being a boy/girl thing," says Higgins. "We have a very strong female character, Ariela, and the queen of Treetopolis is a strong female character, as well."

A comprehensive licensing program was developed in the U.K. and is being developed similarly in the U.S. Giochi Preziosi is master toy licensee for the U.K. and Europe; Random House for publishing; Ravensburger for puzzles; MV Sports for scooters and wheeled toys; Flair for arts and crafts; VMC for accessories; Gemma for greeting cards and party; Egmont for annuals; Rainbow Productions for costumes; Blues Clothing for t-shirts; TDP for nightwear/underwear; and Character World is signed on for bedding.

"We have a certain number of things that have strong sales track records," points out Higgins. "At Licensing Expo, there will be a huge push for consumer products, so we are hopeful it will be the same type of timing that it has been in the U.K. We want to build up demand."

The second series of 26 episodes is now in production and will debut later this year, says Higgins, and a holiday special is also being planned.

In addition, Higgins says live entertainment, and perhaps theatrical, is also being evaluated. In the U.K., Fremantle already has a costume Tom character that goes to different stores and retailers.

"Because of the vibrant world Tom goes into, we can create that fantasy land on stage," he says, adding, "In terms of film, that would be a great opportunity."

In the challenging kids' marketplace, the Tree Fu Tom property is gaining momentum and working its magic to emerge as a bona fide global preschool brand.

Use of the ultrasonic cavitation in wool dyeing process: Effect of the dye-bath temperature.
The present work aims to study the effect of the liquid temperature on the performance of ultrasounds (US) in a dyeing process. The approach was both theoretical and experimental. In the theoretical part the simplified model of a single bubble implosion is used to demonstrate that the "maximum implosion pressure" calculated with the well known Rayleigh-Plesset equation for a single bubble can be correlated with the cavitation intensity experimentally measured with an Ultrasonic Energy Meter (by PPB Megasonics). In particular the model was used to study the influence of the fluid temperature on the cavitation intensity. The "relative" theoretical data calculated from the implosion pressure were satisfactorily correlated with the experimental ones and evidence a zone, between 50 and 60°C, were the cavitation intensity is almost constant and still sufficiently high. Hence an experimental part of wool dyeing was carried out both to validate the previous results and to verify the dyeing quality at low temperatures (40-70°C) in presence of US. A prototype dyeing equipment able to treat textile samples with US system of 600W power, was used. The dyeing performances in the presence and absence of US were verified by measuring ΔE (colour variation), Re,% (reflectance percentage), K/S (colour strength) and colour fastness. The US tests performed in the temperature range of 40-70°C were compared with the conventional wool dyeing at 98°C. The obtained results show that a temperature close to 60°C should be chosen as the recommended US dyeing condition, being a compromise between the cavitation intensity and the kinetics which rules the dyestuff diffusion within the fibres.

Q:

Storing dynamic data in NoSQL

I have scenario where I need to store unstructured data but the rest of my data is structured and relational. An example of the type of unstructured data is as explained below:
User Type 1:

How do you blah blah : 5 fields

User Type 2 :

How do you blah blah : 3 fields

User Type 3 :

How do you blah blah : 7 fields

All 3 types are asked the same question "How do you blah blah" but each user type answers it using different number of fields. And there can be a lot of different user types.
For the relational data, I'm using MySQL but i'm a little confused on how to store this unstructured data:

Serialize as JSON and store in MySQL
Use NoSQL

My requirements are high reads, average updates, average inserts & no deletes. No JOINS needed. I need guaranteed writes & high availability. If I were to choose a NoSQL, it'd be a AP type according to the CAP theorem. I won't be hitting millions of records anytime soon. 
I also plan to provide a text search for this data in the future, but it doesn't need to be a real time search, so I can always index the data using Lucene periodically. But of course, document based NoSQL implementations do provide this out of the box. But I have read in a few places where people have advised against storing JSON data in MySQL. But adding a NoSQL layer could be overkill. 
What do I do & if you do advise me to go for NoSQL DB, which one should I choose?

A:

I'll answer your question in an orthodox manner, with a twist of heresy:
Orthodoxy: You shouldn't store data in a column in a relational database that isn't "atomic."
Heresy: In your specific situation, you could -- maybe -- consider this blob of JSON to be an atomic object.
Years ago, Chris Date said it like this:

"A relation is said to be in first normal form (abbreviated 1NF) if and only if it satisfies the condition that it contains scalar values only"
 Date, C.J. An Introduction to Database Systems, 6th edition (Addison-Wesley, 1995)

Later, he took a somewhat softer stance:

"1NF just means each tuple in the relation contains exactly one value, of the appropriate type, for each attribute. Observe in particular that 1NF places no limitations on what those attribute types are allowed to be."
Date, C. J. Database Design and Relational Theory: Normal Forms and All That Jazz (OReilly Media, 2012)

The "exactly one value" I'm arguing for here is "exactly one JSON object" (which could, in turn contain a JSON array).
Storing things in JSON in a column is a bad idea if you need to the DBMS to manipulate it in any way, since, of course, it can't be properly indexed like properly normalized data can be... but, arguably, if you really really really don't intend for the DBMS to do anything with what you're storing other than write and read it, the case could be made to store a chunk of JSON in a single column, claiming the JSON array of values to be a single atomic value.
The big objection, I think, to doing this, is when it's done out of a lack of familiarity with the relational model or out of laziness or naivete.  Obviously, there are a lot of ways it could be done wrong, but I'd suggest that there's nothing inherently wrong about storing a chunk of JSON in a database, As Long As You Know What You're Doing.™
And, of course, you could use a MySQL FULLTEXT index on it, now that those are supported in InnoDB as of (MySQL 5.6).



Shlomo Havlin

Shlomo Havlin (born July 21, 1942) is a Professor in the Department of Physics at Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel. He served as President of the Israel Physical Society (1996–1999), Dean of Faculty of Exact Sciences (1999–2001), Chairman, Department of Physics (1984–1988).

In 2018 he won the Israel Prize for his accomplishments in physics.

Biography

Professor Shlomo Havlin was born in Jerusalem, Israel (then part of The British Mandate of Palestine). He graduated from Bar-Ilan and Tel-Aviv Universities with Highest Distinction. He obtained an academic position at Bar-Ilan University in 1972 where he became a full Professor in Physics at 1984. During 1978–1979 he was a Royal Society Visiting Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, where he worked with Professors William Cochran and Roger Cowley. In 1984 he became the Chair of the Physics Department at Bar-Ilan University until 1988. During 1983–1984 and 1989–1991, Professor Havlin was a Visiting Scientist at NIH where he collaborated much with Drs. George Weiss, Ralph Nossal and other members of NIH. During 1984–1985 and 1991–1992 he was a Visiting Professor at Boston University, where he collaborated with Professor H. Eugene Stanley  and many others. Between  2016 and 2019 Havlin was  a visiting Professor in Tokyo Institute of Technology, where he collaborated with Profs. Misako and Hideki Takayasu.

Centers and research impact
Professor Havlin established four Centers at Bar-Ilan, the Gonda-Goldschmiedt Medical Diagnostic Research Center (1994), the Minerva Center for Mesoscopics, Fractals and Neural Networks (1998), Science Beyond 2000 – Science Education Unit (1996) and Israel Science Foundation National Center for Complex Networks (2003). He was the President of the Israel Physical Society (1996–1999) and the Dean of the Faculty of Exact Sciences at Bar-Ilan University (1999–2001). Professor Havlin had more than 200 graduate students and postdocs, and collaborated with more than 400 scientists around the globe. He published more than 700 articles and 11 books. He was in 2018 one of the two most cited Israel scientists. He is currently in the editorial board of several scientific journals: Fractals, Physica A, New Journal of Physics, Research Letters in Physics and co-editor of Europhysics Letters.

Prizes and awards

Professor Havlin obtained numerous prizes for his outstanding research, including the Landau Prize for Outstanding Research in Physics (1988), the Humboldt Award – Germany (1992), Prize for best scientific paper of 2000, Bar-Ilan University (2000) and Prize for best popular scientific paper Minister of Science, Israel (2002). He also obtained the Nicholson Medal of the American Physical Society (2006), the Chaim Weizmann Prize for Exact Sciences (2009), the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize for outstanding contribution in physics (2010), the Rothschild Prize for Physical and Chemical Sciences (2014), an Honorary Professor, Beihang University, Beijing, China (2016), the Distinguished Scientist Award, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2017), the Order of the Star of Italy, President of Italy (2017) and the Israel Prize for Physics and Chemistry (2018).

Professor Havlin made many important contributions to science. The following are descriptions of his main contributions in randomness and complexity.

Main contributions
Disordered systems that are self-similar on a broad range of length scales are ubiquitous and often modeled by percolation-type models. The laws that describe transport processes or chemical reactions in these systems are significantly different from those in homogeneous systems. The earlier works of Prof. Havlin, where he discovered several of these important anomalies, had an enormous impact on the development of the whole field and are summarized in the monograph “Diffusion and Reactions in Fractals and Disordered Systems” that he wrote together with his former graduate student Daniel ben-Avraham (Cambridge University Press, 2000). The book describes the anomalous physical laws discovered during 1980-2000 in fractals and disordered systems, many of them by Prof. Havlin and his collaborators. His review article (Adv. in Phys. (1987)) was cited more than 1100 times and was chosen by the journal's editors to be published again (Adv. in Phys. (2002)).
In 2000, Professor Shlomo Havlin and his student Reuven Cohen, together with Prof. Daniel ben-Avraham developed a novel percolation-type approach and derived the first theory on the stability of realistic complex networks such as the Internet under random breakdown (Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 4626 (2000)) and intentional attacks (Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 3682 (2001)). This study is particularly useful for optimizing the stability of networks against intentional attacks and viruses. They also derived a novel result about the “small world” nature of complex networks and found that the diameter of scale free networks is significantly smaller and therefore called them “ultrasmall worlds” (Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 58701 (2003)). Since 2010, Havlin and collaborators have focused heavily on interdependent networks. His paper with collaborators developed the percolation theory of network of networks (Nature, 464, 08932 (2010)) and initiated the current active research field of networks of networks. In 2014, he introduced with collaborators  the concept of recovery in percolation theory (Nature Physics,10, 3438 (2014); Nature Comm., 2016).

Going forward, one of the things I am going to be concentrating more on is Detroit’s neighborhoods. The places where the people actually live. I think many of these images may be predictable, but as we go through the city I think many people will be surprised at the diversity and in some instances affluence of Detroit’s great neighborhoods. This post is just a smattering from the East Side, but it is a good example of what I am talking about – clapboard two family dwellings surrounding palatial gated communities and high rise apartments. But was it always like this ? Yep, going back a a hundred years or so. My grandparents raised their family in one of these type of houses, in one of these neighborhoods. My father was born in a lower flat that my grandfather rented from family friends. A couple blocks away were several large mansions, and a gated community..

Everything that comes after , game mechanics , history and synergy between graphics and gameplay holds my attention. So i think you just can't analyze a game by separated aspects since they merge one with the other.[/QUOTE]. This.. What is the first thing you see, when you start playing a game? The graphics, of course. They get your attention and give you a first impression of what to expect. Then it's up to the gameplay to hold your attention and keep you interested.. Overall, both are needed and must be balanced carefully. If either of them are lacking the game as a whole will lose appeal. But as long as the gameplay is fun and understandable, and the graphics are coherent and consistent, then the result will be a reasonably well made game.. Also, other factors like audio, level design, story and that sort of stuff factor in just as much as gameplay and art, but this thread's only asking about those two.

Maritime Ops: Overcoming high freeboard

When making a climb, sometimes all you have is a boat

By Phillip Null

The first and most critical issue to address in any ship boarding or interdiction is how to get a team on board, a planning concern primarily decided by the freeboard of the vessel.

Freeboard is the height between a ship’s deck and its waterline, or the distance from the water to the rail. On small boats it is low and poses no obstacle to a boarding team that only needs to step across from their own boat to board. On larger vessels and commercial ships the height is significantly increased and can only be overcome from the surface by climbing.

Compliant boats will drop a Jacob’s ladder or make similar accommodations for a team to get on, but an unwilling or hostile crew can’t be expected to do the same. There are only a few methods available to make this climb, and though fast roping from helicopters gets boots on deck quicker and in more intimidating fashion, sometimes all you have is a boat.

Use What’s Available
Everyone has seen photo or video of U.S. Navy SEALS climbing chain to board an anchored ship, a tactic that illustrates the first technique teams should consider. If there is already a ladder over the side and it’s tactically prudent, use it. If capable climbers are involved an anchor chain could provide a viable substitute to a hanging ladder, but remember that once on board the team will be at a disadvantage in most cases as they have to maneuver across an open deck from the bow where the anchor deploys to the accommodation and engineering spaces where the vessel’s controls and most of her crew will be. The chain also won’t be available if the ship’s moving, and even if the anchor is set and the ship is stationary, the climb is going to be awkward and slippery.

Climbing Rope
A rope with a grapnel hook tied to its end could be used for some medium freeboard vessels, but by the time climbers make it up they should expect to be fatigued. If carrying a lot of equipment it only gets worse. Knots can alleviate some of the physical strength needed, but safety concerns persist as there is no solid point to clip in if a fall becomes imminent. Ascenders, particularly the kind with power, are available and will make the job easier, but they require additional training and equipment. Their use also limits the number of simultaneous climbers to the number of lines and ascenders available, a factor that could seriously delay embarkation.

Fixed Ladders
The marine boarding ladder, a favorite of Somali pirates, is the best method for medium freeboard heights in the ten feet or less range. Anything higher and they won’t be able to reach. The best of these are fitted with top hooks that slide over a ship’s handrails or kick plates to keep them secure. Teams lift the ladder onto a hook point, test with a pull, then climb up using rungs spaced between the uprights. More narrow pole ladders are also available, and unlike traditional ladders have their rungs leading away from a single pole rather than suspended between two. Many models are collapsible to allow easy transport and storage and some are also buoyant, preventing those nightmare scenarios where the only way onto a target sank after someone dropped it over the side.

Caving Ladder
These are flexible ladders made of two high strength cables with metal rungs spaced between. Used for highest freeboard embarkations, they come at a standard length of 32 feet, but can be custom made to extend even higher. To set them a hook is attached to the top of the ladder then a telescoping (painter’s) pole is used to raise it up to the deck and secure. These can accommodate multiple climbers at one time, but it’s not recommend until the first climber shores up the hook point with a safety runner to prevent the weight and movement from dropping the hook.

Because the painter’s pole must be extended and locked into place and the ladder and hook must be connected, the setup process can cause delays. Several companies have addressed this issue, including ResQmax which offers the VerTmax Pole, an upgrade on the original telescoping design that uses compressed air to raise and lower for faster employment. They also have a line throwing gun that can deploy climbing ropes up to 100 ft and the weight of a ladder up to 50 feet. Another model from Henriksen uses a mechanical winch similar to a fishing reel to speed extension. A top choice for caving ladders and associated equipment is Yates, a popular climbing and weight handling manufacturer with a record for quality and in stock specialty tactical equipment. The last place you need this kind of hardware to fail is miles from land and 30 feet up the side of a ship.

Opposition
Whenever discussing a high freeboard boarding the question comes up of what to do if the opposition starts trying to release or cut the ladder, rope, etc or otherwise impedes the embarkation from their elevated position on deck. Simple answer is that the bad guys are not only trying to prevent the boarding, but at this point trying to kill officers by forcing their fall. Do whatever’s needed to protect yourself and your team. One way to avoid the interference entirely is to choose the hook or embarkation point wisely. Find a spot those on board aren’t covering or won’t expect and climb on quick with solid cover backing the ascent.

Summary
As discussed there are only a handful of options for overcoming high freeboard from the water’s surface. The final decision on which method a team chooses will be based on the target vessel’s construction, the physical ability of the involved officers, and the amount of gear they need to carry on board. Ladders will take a lot of the physical effort out of the equation, but unless they’re a fixed model will require more hardware like a telescoping pole or launcher to get into action. Regardless the method, good luck and hold on tight. Remember the climb is only the first step — someone will be waiting at the top.

Here's a bit of news that might make you drop that chicken nugget midbite.

Just before the start of the long holiday weekend last Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture quietly announced that it was ending a ban on processed chicken imports from China. The kicker: These products can now be sold in the U.S. without a country-of-origin label.

For starters, just four Chinese processing plants will be allowed to export cooked chicken products to the U.S., as first reported by Politico. The plants in question passed USDA inspection in March. Initially, these processors will only be allowed to export chicken products made from birds that were raised in the U.S. and Canada. Because of that, the poultry processors won't be required to have a USDA inspector on site, as The New York Timesnotes, adding:

"And because the poultry will be processed, it will not require country-of-origin labeling. Nor will consumers eating chicken noodle soup from a can or chicken nuggets in a fast-food restaurant know if the chicken came from Chinese processing plants."

That's a pretty disturbing thought for anyone who's followed the slew of stories regarding food safety failures in China in recent years. As we've previously reported on The Salt, this year alone, thousands of dead pigs turned up in the waters of Shanghai, rat meat was passed off as mutton and — perhaps most disconcerting for U.S. consumers — there was an outbreak of the H7N9 bird flu virus among live fowl in fresh meat markets.

What's more, critics fear that the changes could eventually open the floodgates for a whole slew of chicken products from China. As the industry publication World Poultry notes:

"It is thought ... that the government would eventually expand the rules, so that chickens and turkeys bred in China could end up in the American market. Experts suggest that this could be the first step towards allowing China to export its own domestic chickens to the U.S."

The USDA's decision comes with a backdrop of long-running trade disputes over meat between the U.S. and China. In a nutshell: China banned U.S. beef exports in 2003 after a case of mad cow disease turned up in a Washington state cow. Then, when the bird flu virus broke out widely among Asian bird flocks in 2004, the U.S. blocked imports of Chinese poultry. China challenged that decision in front of the World Trade Organization, which ruled in China's favor in 2010.

And, chicken lovers, brace yourselves: There's more. A report suggests chicken inspections here in the U.S. might be poised to take a turn for the worse. The Government Accountability Office said this week it has serious "questions about the validity" of the new procedures for inspecting poultry across the country.

Basically, these changes would replace many USDA inspectors on chicken processing lines with employees from the poultry companies themselves. The USDA has been piloting the new procedures, which will save money and significantly speed up processing lines, in 29 chicken plants. As The Washington Postreports, the plan is to roll out the new procedures eventually to "most of the country's 239 chicken and 96 turkey plants."

The problem? According to the GAO, the USDA did a poor job of evaluating the effectiveness of the pilot programs it has in place.

As a result, the report concludes, it's hard to justify the USDA's conclusions that the new procedures will do a better job than current approaches at cutting down on the number of dangerous bacteria like salmonella that pop up on the birds that will later end up on our dinner tables.

Still, the USDA maintains that the changes will, in fact, boost food safety. In a commentary published on Food Safety News, USDA food safety and inspections administrator Alfred Almanza writes, "If finalized and implemented broadly, this new inspection system would enable [USDA inspectors] to better fulfill our food safety mission. Nothing in the GAO's report contradicts this basic fact."

Challenges to developing countries after joining WTO: risk assessment of chemicals in food.
FAO/WHO encourages member countries to develop national food control measures based on risk assessment in order to assure proper protection level to consumers and facilitate fair trade. This is particularly important for developing countries as WTO members because it is clearly stated in the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) Agreement that: (a) SPS measures should be based on risk assessment techniques developed by relevant international organizations; and (b) Codex standards which is based on risk assessment are regarded as the international norm in trade dispute settlement. When conducting risk assessment on food chemicals (including additives and contaminants) in developing countries, in most cases it is not necessary to conduct their own hazard characterization because the ADIs or PTWIs of food chemicals developed by international expert groups (e.g. JECFA) are universally applicable and also developing countries do not have the resources to repeat those expensive toxicological studies. On the other hand, it is necessary to conduct exposure assessment in developing countries because exposure to food chemicals varies from country to country. This is not only crucial in setting national standards, but also very important for developing countries to participate in the process of developing Codex standards. In addition to food standard development, risk assessment is also useful in setting up priorities in imported food inspection and evaluating the success of various food safety control measures.

BT believes this is the year it claims British sport

Marc Watson chats Premier League, 4K and British tech

2013 is the year that BT goes all in. Come August it will go head to head with Sky by launching its own rival sports service, BT Sport, offering 38 exclusive live football matches from the Barclays Premier League and a tonne of other sports available across its two channels. It's a market that has long been dominated by Sky, but BT has its own unique kicker - the service is free for its Broadband customers.

And despite both Setanta's and (before it was bought by BT) ESPN's previous failed attempts to break Sky's stronghold, there's an air of confidence about Marc Watson, chief executive of TV at BT Retail. "We're feeling very optimistic," he tells us. "We think there's a really big opportunity to expand the market."

He even bats away suggestions that Sky's retaliations, including offering its first free-to-air live Premiership League match on the first day of the season, are a cause for concern. "We think it's a really good endorsement of the model we've developed and we think it's a positive," he says.

"I think it's great. I think they should do more free actually. I think it's a model the customers like and we'd encourage them to roll that model out across more of their products."

BT's plan is to bring in the masses by waving the "free" banner although you'll need to be an existing BT Broadband customer to enjoy the service charge-free (and pay £3 a month for HD if you sign up after August 1). Those with Sky broadband, meanwhile, can get BT Sport for £15 a month in HD or £12 a month for standard, with a one-off activation fee of £15.

"What I'm hoping it will do is bring more customers into the market who want to watch this sport. Sky is doing one day for free. If [customers] want to watch this kind of sport going forward then there's only one company that's free all the time and that's us," says Watson.

"Only one in five households in the UK take premium sports at the moment," he adds. "And that's not because only one in five households are interested in sports, but because only one in five households can afford the premium sport that's been out there so far."

Vantage point

It's been by standing on the sidelines that BT has been able to plot its attack on the market, and now it's ready to strike. But the proof will be in the BT pudding. Although it's keeping cagey on the numbers right now, Watson is able to tell us that they're "very pleased with the progress so far" in terms of uptake for the service.

Still, Watson agrees that it remains a challenging market. "And the regulation of the UK market is very unbalanced," he adds. But BT's vision is long term, and goes well beyond the two channels it will be offering from August.

"The main difference is that [ESPN and Setanta] only had one product to sell which was the channel," he says. "We're a big business with a bulk of products to sell to customers. And the reason we're interested in sport is because we think it can help us sell our range of products to customers."

Watson is confident that BT has the upper hand

BT believes that it can use its sports service to demonstrate the power of its superfast broadband. "There's a lot of money - £3 billion almost - rolling out for superfast broadband around the UK," says Watson.

"The fastest superfast broadband anywhere in the world. That's a network that's primed and ready to go. And one of the things we can use sport for is to showcase that network. We'll be looking at features and ideas and innovations that help us to do that."

TV StandsStands & Brackets

There is something special about good music, and for some people hearing it at home on a good audio system is a relaxing pastime. The typical midi all-in-one system delivers well in a dorm room or a bedroom, but struggles to fill a good sized living room. This is where a decent separates audio system comes into its own.

Why a Hi-Fi Separates System?
A Separates Hi-Fi system typically has signal sources (CD player, tuner, Ipod interface) as separate devices. This goes into the preamplifier, which allows source selection and volume, balance and tone controls if necessary, then into a separate power amplifier. Alternatively, an integrated amplifier containing preamplifier and power amplifier in one box can be used for more modest systems.

Since the components are standalone units, this offers the opportunity to mix and match units from different manufacturers. This has the advantage of flexibility - a company that makes great CD players, for instance, may not make the best power amplifiers. It allows the buyer to spend money on just the components they will use - no need to get a radio tuner if it will never be used.

Hawai'i Pineapple Co. operates a farm on the Big Island, but most of its production comes from a partnership with Aloun Farm, in Kunia.

1993: Dole tears down its pineapple water tower after closing the cannery in '92.

1983: Del Monte ceases Hawai'i pineapple canning operations.

1968: Canning on Lana'i. Pineapple production starting to slow.

Pineapple farming in Hawai'i declined sharply in the past few years at the hands of two agribusiness industry giants, but increasing numbers of small farmers see sweet opportunity in the crop long associated with the Isles.

"Call us crazy, but let's hope we're crazy like a fox — not crazy crazy," said Craig Bowden, a farm industry veteran who partnered to start two local pineapple farm ventures three years ago and has rapidly expanded.

Bowden was one of 42 pineapple growers in the state in 2007, up from 34 in 2002 and 27 in 1997, according to the three most recent farm census reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The rise in pineapple farming involves mostly small farms, so the crop isn't about to reclaim its crown as king of Hawai'i agriculture — a title lost in 2006 to seed crops.

But the niche growth for pineapple is helping maintain agriculture's roots in Hawai'i and counters a perception for some that pineapple farming is dying out in the state.

"It's part of Hawai'i," said Mark Hudson, statistician for the state Department of Agriculture.

Plantation-scale pineapple farming in Hawai'i has suffered over several decades from competition largely from Central America and Asia where land and labor costs are cheaper. Hawai'i's pineapple production by acreage actually peaked in 1955, though the value of annual pineapple sales topped out in 1991 at $108 million.

CUTBACKS SEEN

The most recent pullbacks involved Del Monte Fresh Produce leaving the local market in 2006, and a cutback last year by Maui Land & Pineapple Co. from roughly 2,000 acres to 1,000 acres. Dole Food Co. reduced its local pineapple business in 2006 from 3,100 acres to 2,700, and remains the biggest grower in the state.

Matthew Loke, agriculture development division administrator with the state Department of Agriculture, said Hawai'i farms still supply 100 percent of pineapple for local consumption, but the changes by big producers have created opportunity for more small farmers, especially organic producers and growers of special varieties.

New growth in local pineapple farming has mostly involved very small farms, according to census figures. On the Big Island, 19 pineapple farms averaged one acre in size. On Kaua'i, 16 acres of pineapple were spread over 13 farms.

Those in the industry suspect that some of the small farms counted in the census don't produce fresh fruit for commercial sale, or may only sell at farmers markets.

Bowden is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, among the new crop of Hawai'i pineapple farmers. A graduate of Kalani High School and former manager with Del Monte who worked in the Philippines, Hawai'i and Florida, Bowden partnered with fellow Kalani alumnus and crop research specialist Tom Menezes to start Hawai'i Pineapple Co. LLC in 2006 and produce fruit under a brand named Hawaiian Crown.

The company started with a few acres of its own pineapple variety sold in Times Super Market, and has since dramatically expanded by tens of acres and added more retail outlets including Foodland Super Market, KTA Super Stores and military commissaries.

GROWTH ON BIG ISLAND

Hawai'i Pineapple Co. operates a farm on the Big Island, but most of its production comes from a partnership with large diversified crop grower Aloun Farm in Kunia on O'ahu.

Bowden said 99 percent of Hawaiian Crown pineapple is sold locally in stores typically for $1.59 to $1.79 a pound, with a few exports to places such as California, Las Vegas and even Dubai.

Bowden said plans are in the works to partner with two more existing farms on O'ahu and the Big Island that would double the size of the business.

On a smaller scale, Sweet Spirit Farms on the Big Island incorporated pineapple farming with a Kona coffee farm started in 2004 by Deb and Paul Sims after they moved to Hawai'i from the Mainland in 2003.

Deb Sims said they started planting crowns from white pineapple they bought to eat, and two years ago had accumulated enough plants to begin selling regularly at the local farmers market where the fruit typically sells for $3 a pound.

"They're easy to grow," she said. "They don't need a lot of care."

Sweet Spirit, which has about 3,600 coffee trees, has about 250 pineapple plants on one-fourth an acre, and Sims said she and her husband intend to plant more. "The supply I don't think meets the demand," she said.

Other small pineapple farmers include Phil Green, who grows organic pineapples on Kaua'i at Kaua'i Organic Farms, and James Bunten and Sharon Umbaugh of Bunten Farms who grow white pineapples on the Big Island.

The growth among small pineapple farmers, however, doesn't mean the business is easy or a sure thing. Small farmers have left the business in recent years, a reminder that farming is inherently tough with its exposure to inclement weather, pests and other factors that are hard to control.

PERSONAL PRODUCTION

On Lana'i — once the world's largest pineapple plantation operated by Dole Food — only one commercial farmer is believed to be growing pineapple, but the plants aren't for commercial production.

Alberta De Jetley farms 18 acres planted in a variety of crops, including lettuce and bananas, sold to the island's two resorts and other local businesses. De Jetley said she first planted pineapple for fun about 18 months ago with about 20 plants, and has since more than doubled plantings of crowns she receives from a hotel bakery.

Still, De Jetley, who once contemplated asking Dole for propagation material for 200 plants, intends to keep her pineapple harvests small for sharing with friends and making what she said is a fantastic fruit salad.

She is stepping up to the plate.

Credit: Instagram / @chrissyteigen; @maroney_mckayla

Chrissy Teigen is one celebrity, mother, model, and television personality who loves to speak her mind. If she has something she wants to say, she’ll say it. And apparently, she wants others to do the same.

Chrissy, along with a host of other celebrities including actress Kristen Bell, have recently declared that they are willing to pay McKayla Maroney’s $100,000 fine if she speaks up against alleged abused Larry Nassar in court.

McKayla said back in October that Larry Nassar sexually abused her for years. It all started when she was just 13 years old! Nassar faces similar accusations from dozens of athletes, including by U.S. gymnasts Gabby Douglas, Maggie Nichols, Simone Biles and Aly Raisman.

Here’s the problem though: McKayla reached a settlement over her claims and faces a $100,000 fine if she speaks at Larry Nassar’s hearing. One hundred twenty-five women and girls have filed civil lawsuits against Nassar. That’s why Chrissy and other female celebrities are stepping up to the plate and offering to help McKayla, although it might not be that easy. It also might not be something that McKayla wants. Here’s why.

Ask Our Leaders What They Will Do For Children In Care!

Some of our most vulnerable children are in care today, their voice often drowned out by other competing interests inside the system, so a recent call backed by children’s charities and support groups on our government leaders to pledge their support for these children during the Leaders’ Debate broadcast on 2nd April is a great idea.

You can read the Open Letter to our senior politicians here, which calls on the country’s leaders to tell the nation on 2nd April what they will do for children in care. Sadly, if pledges are made during the broadcast there is no way of enforcing them, but at least our politicians will be aware of what is important to the public moving forward. And we will all be watching them.

News. Nelsonville Bypass Getting New Barriers. By: Athens Messenger staff reports. Posted on:. Motorists driving the Nelsonville bypass might wonder why there are orange construction barrels lining the new highway on its western end.. A contractor will be installing cable barrier in the median of the highway, according to Alan Craig of the Ohio Department of Transportation's District 10 office.. Nationwide Construction Group, based in Michigan, has been awarded a nearly $1.54 million contract for the work, which will include the entire bypass and is scheduled to be completed this fall, Craig said.. The barrier — basically a guardrail made with cable rather than metal beams — is intended to prevent vehicles from crossing the median and hitting oncoming traffic, Craig said..

Rather that restrict traffic for the full length of the bypass at one time, it was decided to do the project in stages, Craig said.

Astronomical Society of South Australia

The Astronomical Society of South Australia (ASSA) was founded in 1892 and is the oldest society of its kind in Australia. It is the only representative body for amateur astronomy in the state of South Australia.
It holds regular general monthly meetings, frequent meetings for members of specialised groups and has available two observatories, one with a 300mm telescope at The Heights School within easy reach of Adelaide and used primarily for public viewing, and a second at Stockport with 500mm and 450mm telescopes presently in service and a larger 36-inch instrument currently being considered.

Membership
The ASSA has approximately 500 members. People of all ages are able to join.

Observatories and facilities
The ASSA has a choice of facilities available to members and guests:
Stockport Observatory - this was badly damaged  in a severe storm in 2010, but in late 2013 the Astronomical Society of South Australia was given $50,000 by the State Government to pay for half of the cost of a new dome. The observatory is used as a teaching tool, hosting groups of curious students and members the public, but it also has an impressive research record.

The question may sound strange but lately, reading immigration news, I started to wonder whether immigrating to Canada through the Quebec process was still worth it.

Indeed, prospective immigrants to Canada who are planning to settle in Quebec must go through “the Quebec process”, since the province selects immigrants to achieve certain objectives. Meanwhile, the federal government of Canada is still responsible for admitting immigrants.

So if you are planning to settle in Quebec, you must go through two distinct processes:

First, being selected by the provin­cial gov­ern­ment of Que­bec and obtain a Certificat de Sélection du Québec (CSQ). At this stage, your edu­ca­tional and work back­grounds are assessed, as well as your abil­ity to inte­grate into Que­bec.

Second, being accepted by the fed­eral gov­ern­ment of Canada. Per­ma­nent res­i­dence can be granted after a medical exam and a background check.

Those planning to settle in Quebec have long known that the additional step, obtaining a CSQ,incurred extra fees. For the principal applicant, it was CA$406 (before April 1, 2012) and for the spouse and each dependent child, it was CA$156. And each member of the family, including kids, needs a CSQ.

Yet prospective immigrants didn’t mind the extra cost and hassle for a lot of reasons:

Quebec has long favoured francophone immigrants and immigrating through the Quebec process was said to be easier than going through the federal process.

A lot of French speakers do want to settle in Quebec for linguistic or cultural reasons.

The province of Quebec heavily advertises immigrating to “la belle province” through a network of Bureaux d’Immigration du Québec (BIC) around the world that offers free information sessions.

The proof of funds required for Quebec-selected applicants is much lower than the proof of funds required for those immigrating to other provinces ($2,889 for one adult arriving in Quebec versus $11,115 for an adult settling anywhere else in Canada).

The immigration process through Quebec was said to be faster for qualified French speakers.

But lately, the Ministry of Immigration and Cultural Communities responsible for immigration matters in Quebec made a number of dramatic changes to the process.

First, on April 1, 2012, the fees levied by the Gouvernement du Québec for processing an immigration application were raised from $406 to $750—ouch! And don’t forget that the Quebec process is only half of the process, you still have the pay the permanent residence fees to the Government of Canada.

Second, to obtain the CSQ, even native French speakers (for instance, French citizens) must now take a French language test. The fees depend on where you take the test, but seem to be around €100 in France.

Third, Quebec is facing a heavy backlog of applications and obtaining a CSQ takes longer and longer. For instance, the Quebec visa office in Paris is currently processing applications it received in September 2011. For Northern Africa immigrants, processing times are much much longer: the Quebec visa office in Algeria is currently processing application received in… July 2008! You can see the processing times here for other visa offices around the world. And don’t forget that this is just one step of the process: the federal government then have to process your application!

So going through the Quebec process is now more expensive, with more hassle, and takes longer than ever—hence my initial question, “is it still worth it?”

I’m not arguing whether settling in Quebec is a good idea. I understand the province has a strong appeal for a lot of French speakers, and if you do plan to live in Quebec, you don’t have the choice, you must go through the Quebec immigration process.

But if you are hesitating between living in Quebec and living in other provinces, I’d urge you to see whether going through the federal process would be easier, faster and cheaper.

Sensitive, high-resolution observations of Galactic neutral hydrogen (HI) reveal an intricate network of slender linear features. Across the high Galactic latitude sky, this HI is aligned with the magnetic field as traced by both starlight polarization and Planck 353 GHz polarized dust emission. The structure of the neutral interstellar medium is more tightly coupled to the magnetic field than previously known. At high Galactic latitudes, where the Planck data are noise-dominated, the HI data provide an independent constraint on the plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation, and hence the local dust polarization angle. The HI data thus provide a new tool for measuring foregrounds to polarized CMB experiments. I will discuss ongoing work using HI morphology to better constrain the polarized foreground, and to better understand the nature of the magnetized ISM.. Magnetic Fields in the Interstellar Medium.

“This is not only an opportunity to invest in infrastructure and lay down the framework for what will be millions of square feet and dozens of buildings, said managing director for Goldman Sachs UIG Margaret Anadu, “but do so in a way that’s really going to benefit Baltimore residents.”

The $660 million tax increment funding (TIF) that Sagamore received last year from the city is cited as a key factor in the UIG’s decision to invest. Anadu said the TIF signified the project was supported by the city and displayed strong public-private partnerships

“With the approval of the TIF, that said the city and state were behind this,” she said. “Then you have Sagamore as the quarterback—they are relentless."

⇓ Article continues below ⇓

A key factor in the collaboration between the private and public sectors was the Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) signed last year between Sagamore, the city, and SB7—an organization that represents the South Baltimore communities of Brooklyn, Cherry Hill, Curtis Bay, Lakeland, Mt. Winans, Westport, and Port Covington. The agreement ensures that the communities in South Baltimore continue to thrive culturally, economically, educationally, and socially during the 20-year redevelopment process of Port Covington.

The $233 million investment will uphold the promise made in the CBA to invest in infrastructure—roads, utilities, and parks for the community—during all phases of the project. Goldman Sachs said they wouldn’t play a huge role in the planning process beyond the monetary impact.

“We will have a voice in the direction of the project,” Anadu said. “But we will primarily serve as investors, leaving day to day on-the-ground execution to the Sagamore team."

Plank Industries CEO, Tom Geddes, said the project would bring thousands of new jobs to the city, nearly 1.5 million square feet of office and retail space, a 200-room hotel, and apartments.

Of the 235 acres, a portion will remain untouched during the redevelopment, and that includes Under Armour’s 50-acre headquarters, as well as City Garage, Nick’s Fish House, Sagamore Spirit Distillery, and the newly opened Rye Street Tavern.

“You won’t see a lot of activity on the site over the next 12-18 months,” Geddes says. “But there will be a tremendous amount of behind-the-scenes work on planning and design going on getting the site shovel ready.”

The prospects of this new investment have Mayor Catherine Pugh optimistic about the new partnership and what it means for the city’s residents.

“This investment, especially from such a prominent partner as Goldman Sachs, means more jobs, more opportunity and more economic growth for Baltimore City,” she said in a statement. “Investors are seeing what we already know about Baltimore—we’re a city on the rise, and an economic hub with a strong, diverse workforce.”

This move comes as Sagamore is in the process of drafting a proposal to Amazon to move a second headquarters to the Port Covington development. Last week, the online retail giant released a statement requesting bids for the new location by October 19. If selected, it would bring 50,000 new jobs and a $5 billion investment in office space to Baltimore.

“We think Port Covington would be a phenomenal location for Amazon,” Geddes said. “Having the vote of confidence of an institution like Goldman Sachs is nothing but helpful.”

Geddes is hopeful that the new partnership represents progress for Port Covington and delivers on the commitment made to bring outside investments to the city.

“We could not be happier that we have Goldman Sachs as our partner,” Geddes said. “It was important to us to find an equity partner that shared our common vision for urban economic growth, job creation, and local workforce development here in Baltimore City.”

Fourteen normal subjects (18-42 y) were studied using venous occlusion plethysmography to investigate the characteristics and reproducibility of the forearm vasoconstrictor response following a prolonged venous occlusion stimulus. Upon release of the stimulus, a transient vasodilation is followed by a vasoconstriction. As the stimulus of venous occlusion pressure increased (40, 60, 80, and 100 mmHg for 5 min), there was a significant increase in maximum flow (p = 0.01). Minimum relative flow (minimum divided by control) was unchanged except at the highest occlusion pressure (0.49 +/- 0.05, 0.38 +/- 0.04, 0.47 +/- 0.07, 0.66 +/- 0.12, p = 0.04). As venous occlusion duration increased (3, 4, 5, and 6 min at 80 mmHg), there was no significant change in minimum relative flow (p = 0.73). With increasing ambient temperature (18, 23, and 28 degrees C), there were no significant changes in maximum or minimum relative flows (p = 0.40 and 0.25, respectively). Minimum relative flow was not significantly altered following occlusion with a 2.5-cm cuff vs. a 10-cm cuff (p = 0.77). Thus, the vasoconstriction response was reproducible over a range of venous occlusion stimuli and experimental conditions. We conclude that dynamic vascular responsiveness to prolonged venous occlusion can be measured by venous plethysmography and that calculation of the minimum flow relative to control flow is an appropriate and reproducible index of the vasoconstrictor response. Based on our studies and to conveniently measure these changes, we recommend a 10-cm venous occlusion cuff, with a pressure < or = 80 mmHg, for durations < or = 5 min, in an ambient temperature of 23 degrees C.

Transonic’s ELSA Monitor Featured on PerfWeb. VV ECMO, or veno-venous ECMO, primarily supports lung function. VV ECMO support can be obtained several ways. Commonly, a double lumen cannula is placed in the right internal jugular vien (right IJ people will know) or two cannulas are used, one residing in the right IJ and another in a femoral vein. The patient’s condition and age will depend on which option is used.. Recirculation is a known complication of VV ECMO that is oftentimes poorly understood and poorly addressed. To reduce this complication, the ECMO team needs an objective measurement for the optimal placement of dual-site cannulation or single dual-lumen cannulation. That’s where Transonic’s ELSA monitor comes in.. The ELSA monitor was recently featured on PerfWeb. Learn more about the monitor and how the PerfWeb panel uses it in this episode.

[Why is it so difficult to legislate on alcohol in Spain?].
Wine belongs to the Mediterranean culture. Drinking alcohol is part of our social life, and its negative consequences have often been minimised, blame being apportioned rather to the individual, who doesn't know how to drink, than to the agent causing the harm. In recent years, road accidents and binge-drinking among young people have put alcohol on the political agenda. Adolescents and young adults have increased their consumption, and a pattern of binge-drinking has developed based on the open-air 'fiesta' nightlife, where groups of young people drink large bottles in the streets and squares (botellón). Educational campaigns and material have been mounted and produced, but two consecutive draft laws on measures for the prevention of alcohol-related harm have failed to be approved, coming up on both occasions against the same vested interests. This editorial reviews the ambivalence of society towards regulations on alcohol and the current state of the art. The first draft law (2002) was about preventing alcohol problems in the general population; the second (2006) was limited to the question of prevention among minors. Nobody could oppose it, not even the industry. However, an interested bias put the accent on wine--which allegedly should be considered not as alcohol but rather as food, and consequently removed from the law--so that discussion of the draft law became a 'wine war', with predictable consequences. Once again, a draft law on alcohol was shelved sine die and tossed into a corner to gather dust. WithIn this pessimistic scene, though, there are still some positive signs. No economic or political motives should constitute an obstacle to the protection of minors, at the very least.

Ok, I am exhausted by this.. I cannot fathom the fact that Shopify fails to show prices with and without VAT properly. Ridiculous. My currency is SEK.. I downloaded Exemptify to display prices in both VAT and without. I added the snippet under the head as instructed.. Then when I look at my cart with a product, the vat prices look distorted. Absolutely ridiculous. Sorry if I sound angry but I am. Customers are not the most intelligent creatures and if they go to the checkout page and find "hidden" fees I am screwed.. I attached a picture.. I am on the same boat :-/. I will be following this topic to see if anyone has an answer.

Gravity Rush’s art draws heavily from the Franco-Belgian comic book style “bande dessinee” from the 1800-1920s, which is marked by exaggerating elements that the reader should pay the most attention to.. The art style is accompanied by a soundtrack reminiscent of the era, with strong accordion-driven scores. The result is a highly atmospheric game environment that is beautiful as much as it is addictive.

The Chief Whip said that the Congress leaders were trying to lead protests, based on lies. The only objective of the Congress party is to tarnish the image of IT Minister K Taraka Rama Rao (KTR), who has nothing to do with the incident, he added.. Dalits and Nerella victims are unhappy with the Congress party's efforts to turn a law & order issue into an issue for Vote bank politics, he observed. "The Congress's allegations of sand mafia against Minister KTR are laughable," he commented.. During the Congress regime, less than Rs 10 crores was added to the governement's exchequer, against revenue collected from the supply of sand from the 23 districts of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, Eshwar remarked. The sand policy being implemented in the state of Telangana is today, inspiring the nation, he added.. Please submit your comments.

Fish full life-cycle testing for 17beta-estradiol on medaka (Oryzias latipes).
We studied the chronic effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) on the reproductive status of medaka (Oryzias latipes) over two generations under continuous exposure to assess its hazard on this species. The exposure of parental (F0) medaka to E2 was begun on embryos within 12 h postfertilization and continued for up to 101 d; the assessment endpoints included embryological development, hatching, posthatch survival, growth, sexual differentiation, reproduction, and hepatic vitellogenin (VTG) levels under flow-through exposure to E2 at each mean measured concentration of 0.939, 2.86, 8.66, 27.9, and 92.4 ng/L. Eggs (F1) spawned from the F0 fish at 98, 99, and 100 d posthatch were also examined for hatchability, survival after hatching, growth, sexual differentiation, and hepatic VTG level until 59 d posthatch. In the F0 medaka, no concentration-related effect of E2 was observed on hatching, posthatch mortality, and growth. However, we observed abnormal sex differentiation, induction of VTG, and reproductive impairment in a dose-dependent manner. The lowest-observed-effect concentration and no-observed-effect concentration of E2 for these effects were 8.66 and 2.86 ng/L, respectively. In the F1 medaka treated with E2 at < or = 8.66 ng/L, however, dose-dependent effects were not observed in any parameter. The results indicate that E2 can have significant effects on reproductive potential of medaka at concentrations as low as 8.66 ng/L, suggesting that the ecological risk of E2 is higher than that of weak estrogens, such as nonylphenol and octylphenol.

Description: “Herbal chocolate tea made from the shell of the cacao bean.”. Review: I admit that I am a huge chocolate fan, so when MiCaco reached out to me and offered to let me try their tisane, I couldn’t say no! The tisane is made out of 100% cacao and is a blend of shell and nibs of the cacao bean.. The dry cacao was earthy and sweet, with a scent of dark chocolate, which became more pronounced when wet. The steeped liquor tasted earthy and fruity, with a lingering chocolate aftertaste. The aroma was sweet and chocolatey.. I could see this tisane tasting really nice with some additives such as milk which would make the liquor creamier. I would love to dry more chocolate teas in the future (3/5 rating).. 2 comments on “MiCacao’s Natural Cacao Tea | Tea Review”. That is one I definitely need to try!. I’m sorry! I thought I replied. I really enjoyed it. 🙂

When the grandkids come I give one of them a bandana to hold out of sight, I sneeze and tell Rocky to go find me a hanky. Of course, he gives them all the once over (to squeals of delight!) until he finds the one with the bandana. When he brings it to me he gets a treat.

The43 old tree frog used to say that it made him feel better just to see their knees coming toward him.. This tree frog is widespread in the coastal lowlands and in the Tepalcatepec Valley up to elevations of about 1200 meters.. The tree frog was also out, sitting in a cool, damp corner of125 the grass rows.. If they had but known it, the tree frog at that minute had ten legs, for six and four are ten.. The tree frog said that he remembered perfectly well when the eggs were laid on the wild cherry tree on the edge of the23 meadow.. There were screams of night birds, the long note of the owl, the tree frog beseeching stridently for rain.. You have acted as lazy as the tree frog says boys and girls sometimes do.. The leaves of this tree and especially its saplings, are favorite foraging places for the tree frog.. The tree frog and the eatable frog live in the north of Nippon.. For an answer to this the tree frog ran out his tongue, and, sure enough, it was fastened at the front end.

This just in from Pierre Lafond:. Hi,.. Santa Barbara Winery has been in its current location since 1965. We are very excited to have Lafond Winery tasting room coming to town! Customers will have a great view of the actual production. We have a glass door that leads to our bottling warehouse so they will be able to get a view of what goes on behind the scenes!. Cheers!.

Regulation of osteoclast apoptosis by Bcl-2 family protein Bim and Caspase-3.
Apopotosis of osteoclasts is regulated by the Bcl-2 family protein Bim. Bim is degraded in the course of osteoclast apoptosis, which is regulated by Caspase-3. Osteoclasts generated from caspase-3 -/- mice exhibited a shorter life span and a higher bone-resorbing activity than those generated from normal littermates. These results suggest the important role of Caspase-3-Bim axis in regulating both apoptosis and activation of osteoclasts.

Severity of acid gastroesophageal reflux assessed by pH metry: is it associated with respiratory disease?
About 50% of children with chronic respiratory diseases (RD) have "silent" gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Our purpose was to evaluate the possibility that RD in patients with GER reflects the presence of more severe acid reflux. We compared the severity of parameters from pH studies in children with chronic RD and "silent" GER, to children with signs of symptomatic gastrointestinal (GI) GER with and without RD. This study included 236 children (aged 1 month to 15 years) with abnormal 24-hr pH monitoring among 718 patients studied for suspected diagnosis of GER. Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 consisted of children with chronic RD but without any GI symptoms of GER. Group 2 was comprised of children with symptomatic GI presentation of GER such as regurgitation, vomiting, heartburn, and failure to thrive, but without any signs or symptoms of RD. Group 3 included children with prevalent RD and concomitant signs of symptomatic GER. Patients with predominant GI manifestations (group 2) had a significantly higher fraction of time with pH <4 (P < 0.01), total time value of pH <4 (P < 0.05), and longest episode with pH <4 (P < 0.05). Esophageal clearance was significantly longer in group 1 patients than in the other two groups (P < 0.05). Patients with mixed disease (group 3) were similar to patients in group 2. Patients with GI symptoms had significantly worse scores for all parameters evaluated except esophageal clearance score, compared to patients without GI symptoms. Longer esophageal clearance was the only parameter associated with respiratory signs in patients with respiratory symptoms compared to those without. In conclusion, the presence of RD in pediatric patients with silent GER is related to longer esophageal clearance, but is not related to severity of reflux.

[Ultrasonic mammography: its importance in integrated diagnosis of breast diseases (author's transl)].
Sonography of the breast is gaining in importance with the spread of diagnostic methods based on ultrasound in general and the increasing technical perfection of the equipment in particular. Over and above this, the increase in incidence of carcinoma of the breast at an increasingly early age represents a permanent challenge to achieve further optimisation of diagnostic methods. The following conclusions have been arrived at after evaluating 493 ultrasonic examinations of the breast, 212 of which were verified histologically (90 carcinomas): 1. If the indication is precise, sonography possesses a high degree of sensitivity in diagnosing any changes occurring in the breast. 2. The method offers particular advantages in patients with manifest signs having a dense parenchyma; in fact, with such patients sonography is often superior to mammography. 3. The additional use of sonography in diagnosis of diseases of the breast improves the results and often facilitates a less aggressive procedure (insofar as biopsies can be omitted). The main drawbacks are the great amount of time required for performing the examination, and the problem of documentation. This has been the major obstacle to using sonography in screening. The article discusses the indications, the typical sonographic criteria and problems of differential diagnosis in relation to the most frequently encountered diseases of the breast.

Furniture. Furniture. A piece of furniture serves two parameters – function and aesthetics within a given space. The furniture contains values of human need, it can be a human gesture, storage function or any experience dependent on the tenant and his various needs. The furniture creates a dialogue with itself as an object or sculpture in space and with furniture adjacent to it. The furniture creates a dialogue with itself as an object or sculpture in space and with furniture adjacent to it. The furniture gets a visual meaning since beyond its being a function, most of the daytime meets an aesthetic visual need.. The furniture is an object whose design is timeless and is not trendy and the thought of integrating it into space combines long-term thought. We combine three different furniture systems, which vary in size: furniture that is planned in detail by us, furniture that is purchased as new and existing furniture, which contains a dimension of obsolescence and other time.

AMD Threadripper 3rd Generation. AMD continues to impress with its new Desktop processor “Threadripper” third-generation CPU which is indeed an improvement on its predecessor.. What makes it a better performer than its 2nd gen predecessor?. The major difference between the two generations is the allocation of the memory controller. Previous gen processor allocated memory controller to certain memory die only. This resulted in the memory die without a memory controller to take an entire cycle in CPU to reach the ones with it.. Third Generation Threadripper has improved upon it by making a single I/O die which would have all the chiplets connected to. I/O die has PCX, memory access, SATA connection, and many more. Contrary to its predecessor, every chiplet can now access the memory directly and can contain 6 or 8 cores.

Q:

How to allow acces to a symbolic link in my ~/Sites/ for Apache under Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2

I need allow access to a sym-linked directory within ~/Sites from my Apache.
I Symlinked the directories like this
ln -s ~/path/to/the/source/directory/ ~/Sites/source-link-here

Now whenever I fire up a GET request I get a 403 reply
curl http://localhost/~username/source-link-here/
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
<title>403 Forbidden</title>
</head><body>
<h1>Forbidden</h1>
<p>You don't have permission to access /~username/source-link-here
on this server.</p>
...

How can I tell Apache to allow acces to the symlinked directory and how do I tell Apache
to allow this only for requests fired from localhost.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Best regards

    Allow from all
</Directory>

Edit the /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf file and make sure the line under “# Virtual hosts” is not commented out, like so:
Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

Edit the /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf file and add:

Present at the Creation: Planetary Resources, the Silicon Valley of Space

While it has been the cause of significant buzz, relatively little has been known about the company Planetary Resources other than the names of its A-list founders and backers that include James Cameron, Google's Eric Schmidt, Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Peter Diamandis, founder of the X Prize.

It's an impressive group, and that is why investor Ross Perot Jr. was not alone in his sentiment when he said "I believe in the team - betting on the jockey, not the horse."

Planetary Resources promises to be a fast horse as well. The company plans to send a fleet of droids to space to prospect the most valuable near-Earth asteroids. The project, which will require billions of investment dollars, could yield a trillion dollar reward, as precious metals exist in almost infinite quantities in space.

We learned a great deal more about the company yesterday at a public unveiling at the Museum of Flight in Seattle where the founders of Planetary Resources outlined their plan to "add tens of billions of dollars to the GDP annually."

"Since my early teenage years, I've wanted to be an asteroid miner," said founding member Peter Diamandis. "Now, the vision of my colleagues makes that dream not only a reality, but something we need to do."

Here's what Planetary Resources has done, and what they plan to do down the road.

The company has set up shop in Bellevue, WA, and currently employees two dozen engineers. "We're starting the Silicon Valley of space up here in Seattle," the founders announced. Indeed, part of the purpose of the public unveiling was to get the word out, as the company says it is looking to find "the world's best engineers."

"Not only can small groups of people change the world, it's the only thing that ever has."

If that statement has been true throughout history, Diamandis says a few important developments have enabled this specific innovation. These are:

Exponentially-growing technology is enabling small corporations using lower-cost robotics and spacecraft to do what only governments could do before.

Commercial space flight has finally arrived

Risk-tolerant investors like Elon Musk and Richard Branson have been willing to invest in space.

What this will enable Planetary Resources to do is "bring the solar system within our area of economic influence" said co-founder Eric Anderson. In other words, near-Earth asteroids in our solar system hold two enormously valuable resources in great abundance. These are:

Water: H20 is for drinking, of course, but also for propulsion. This resource will allow Planetary Resources to drastically reduce the cost of space exploration and open up "space gas stations" to support mining missions that will open up the road to deep space exploration.

Precious metals: Metals like platinum are useful in all sorts of industrial applications - from microelectronics to medical devices to catalytic converters.

So the founders of Planetary Resources clearly have their eyes on the prize -- but which prize precisely remains the question. There are nearly 9,000 discovered near-Earth asteroids to choose from, which represent 1 percent of the asteroids we believe to exist.

So the company plans to zero in on the specific asteroids they want to target, study the rotation rate, potential, and necessary support resources.

While they aren't afraid to dream big, the founders of Planetary Resources admit there's "a significant probability that we could fail, but we believe that the attempt is worth it." Indeed, they plan to live and learn from their failures, said Chris Lewicki, President & Chief Engineer of Planetary Resources.

While the task is indeed difficult, the founders pointed out that companies like Shell and others have created "fully robotic cities on the bottom of the ocean to drill for oil. This looks easy by comparison."

And what about the timeline? While the founders said "we come from the Burt Rutan school of not giving out timelines," Peter Diamandis did offer this explanation: "We aim to identify the first asteroids to prospect within the decade."

Broward Deputies Vote ‘No Confidence’ On Sheriff Israel

Broward Deputies Vote ‘No Confidence’ On Sheriff Israel

The deputies of Broward County have issued a stunning rebuke of Sheriff Scott Israel by voting “no confidence” in his leadership.

The deputies voted “no confidence” by a 534-94 margin and will ask Florida Governor Rick Scott to remove Israel from his position.

Sheriff Israel has faced intense scrutiny for the way he handled the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February.

Deputy Scot Peterson, the school resource officer on duty at the time of the shooting, waited outside when it was clear what was going on inside the school. It was later revealed that even after additional deputies arrived on scene, they waited behind their cars instead of entering the school and trying to eliminate the threat. The deputies were reportedly given an order to “stand down.” (RELATED: Broward County Sheriff Denies Mishandling Shooting Response)

Through my art, I want to reinforce the idea that it is important to take care of ourselves and reduce the risk of infection by wearing a mask. A mask is our current medicine, and I want to remind people through my art that we can reduce the risk of getting infected and instead stay healthy by wearing a mask, washing our hands, and maintaining social distance.

Farman F.160

__NOTOC__

The Farman F.160 was a heavy bomber aircraft developed in France in the late 1920s. It was essentially an attempt by Farman Aviation Works to modernise its tremendously successful F.60 Goliath design of the immediately postwar years. The most noticeable external difference was the larger tailfin of the new aircraft. Like its predecessor, it was a large three-bay biplane of conventional configuration with unstaggered wings of equal span. Initially conceived as a heavy night bomber, most examples built were float-equipped torpedo bombers for the Aéronautique Maritime, which operated some 40 of the F.165 variant and 200 of the F.168. One of the original F.160 night bombers was exported to Italy, and one to Japan. Plans to develop airliner versions did not progress past the prototype stage.

Variants
F.160 Four-seat night bomber with two  Farman 12We engines, designated F.160 BN.4 by Aviation Militaire.
F.161 One airliner with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Akx engines and one bomber similar to the F.160, powered by 2x  Farman 12Wers engines.
F.162 One prototype airliner with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Akx engines.
F.163 Airliner with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Aa engines.
F.165 Seaplane torpedo bomber with 2x Gnome-Rhône 9A  or 9Aa engines.
F.166 2x  Salmson 9Ab engines.
F.167 Seaplane torpedo bomber with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Aa engines.
F.168 Seaplane torpedo bomber with Gnome-Rhône 9Akx engines; main production version, 200 built.
F.169 Improved airliner version with Gnome-Rhône 9Akx engines.
F.268 One F.168 fitted with 2x supercharged  Salmson 18 Abs engines.
F.269 One F.169 fitted with floats and modified wings as a sesquiplane seaplane.
F.368 One F.168 re-engined with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Kbrs engines.

H. Clay Earles

Henry Clay Earles (August 11, 1913 – November 16, 1999) was the founder and chairman of the board of Martinsville Speedway, a NASCAR stock car racing track that Earles built in 1947 in Ridgeway, Virginia that was one of the circuit's first paved oval tracks and stands as one of its shortest.

Born in Axton, Virginia on August 11, 1913, Earles started making money as a five-year-old, selling unwanted leaves from his father's tobacco farm. Initially educated in a one-room schoolhouse, he dropped out of school so that he could help support his family with the 25 cents he earned each hour at a furniture factory.

His first business venture was a failed pool hall, but a gas station was successful and its profits helped pay for a drive-in restaurant in Martinsville, Virginia. The restaurant was sold to buy another gas station. Having seen the crowds attracted by car racing at temporary tracks at fairgrounds, he built a track on  of land he had purchased in 1946. The first scheduled race, predating the establishment of NASCAR, took place on September 7, 1947, drawing more than 6,000 spectators at a facility that only had 750 seats; Seating capacity had grown to 86,000 by the time of Earles' death. In its inaugural year, Bill France, Sr. provided the track with advertising and drivers in exchange for one-fourth of profits, and became the founding president of NASCAR when it was incorporated the next year. Martinsville Speedway is the only one of NASCAR's original tracks still in use.

Red Byron was awarded a $500 prize for winning the inaugural race at the track, which had grown to $170,000 by 1999. Earles began a tradition in 1964 of distributing grandfather clocks to race winners, with Richard Petty receiving a track-record of 12, and would have received three more for wins that predated the inception of the practice.

The track measures  around, with a pair of  straightaways and tight turns banked at 12 degrees, described as two dragstrips with tight turns. The track was first paved in 1955. Unlike the superspeedways, Martinsville became a track where the skill and strategy of each individual driver could overcome the big money and horsepower of the larger teams.

Earles died at age 86 on November 16, 1999 at his Martinsville home.

SIDEBAR: Strub recounts how he took activism to the streets, and the Church

by Chuck Colbert

One need not be Roman Catholic to understand that Sean Strub’s new book “Body Counts” is in no small measure fueled partly by his faith. From the very beginning, Strub calls out the Church and its hierarchical leadership on many fronts, everything from hypocrisy to hostility, as the AIDS epidemic continues to wreak havoc on gay men and others.

The preface, for example, recounts AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power’s (ACT UP) liturgical disruption, staged on Sunday, Dec. 10, 1989 at New York’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral, arguably a major power center of American Catholicism. Inside, Strub was among the protestors.

Indeed, crashing then-Cardinal John O’Connor’s Sunday Mass was controversial, if not the most controversial of ACT UP’s activism.

“After Mass, I pass through the cathedral’s heavy doors into bright sunlight, and it seems to me into the arms of my true community,” Strub wrote. “I am exultant, in a state that feels like grace, certain that if I am to die of AIDS, I will die a fighter.”

In chapter 17, Strub’s sharpened quill reminds readers that O’Connor “condemned LGBT activism, opposed anti-discrimination statutes, called homosexuality an ‘intrinsic evil,’” at the same time he “prevented groups of gay Irish-Americans from participating in the annual St. Patrick’s Day parade and kicked Dignity, the gay Catholic group, out of all facilities controlled by the archdiocese, where they had celebrated Mass for many years.”

Strub recalled how New York City’s cardinal archbishop banned church-run hospitals from distributing condoms or discussing safe sex with patients, even as staff nurses, doctors and nuns widely ignored his directive.

Most egregious perhaps, O’Connor funded a disinformation campaign, claiming on billboards, buses and subways that “condoms don’t work,” by citing discredited statistics that suggested a 50 percent failure rate or greater. The cardinal “even opposed condom use between two partners when one was known to be HIV positive.”

“At the same time,” Strub wrote, “O’Connor took every opportunity to boast the Church’s compassion toward people with AIDS who were dying in church-run hospices. His hypocrisy was galling; most of the world hated gay people when we were healthy and sexually active but accepted us as dying ‘AIDS’ victims.”

The last straw for Strub and others was the cardinal’s blocking safer-sex education via condom use in New York City schools. “We knew we had to do something,” Strub wrote, explaining in part ACT UP’s decision to disrupt Mass.

During a recent telephone interview, Stub, who for a short time thought he had a calling to the priesthood, spoke of his Irish Catholic upbringing. “I certainly grew up in a Catholic environment,” he said, noting his father’s devotion to the Blessed Virgin. Nuns raised his mother, an orphan.

And yet Strub acquired “skepticism about the Church,” growing up in Iowa City, Iowa, a college town where he was “exposed to a lot of different kinds of values and perspectives,” he said. Just as Strub absorbed Catholicism’s social justice tradition, so he learned the “you-will-do-as-we-are-told aspect of the Church,” he said.

“When I came out in the late 70s, that started a fissure with the Church that only grew over time,” as the epidemic only exacerbated the rift. With the death of his partner Michael in 1988, Strub said, “I went into a kind of hyperactive activist overdrive.”

The cover of “Body Counts” features a picture of Strub and then-partner Michael Misove.

Strub also discussed the historical significance of taking AIDS activism to a nerve center of the Catholic Church in America. Undoubtedly controversial, Strub always favored the St. Patrick’s Cathedral protest. “If one scans the list of who got arrested” — Strub was not — “half inside and half outside,” he said, “the preponderance of those inside were culturally Catholic with Irish, Italian, and Polish surnames. That explains what drove a lot of the action. A lot [of those arrested] grew up in the Church and still felt some right, some piece of ownership that we could take our redress to the Church. For me, it was the culmination of a year’s mourning.”

For all the controversy, opposition and risk, ACT UP decided to go ahead with the protest. “We did it anyway because it was so important,” said Strub, noting, from historical hindsight, its historical significance: “December 1989 was 20 years after Stonewall. While Stonewall was the first time the gay community kind of really fought back against the civil code that oppressed us, and it was landmark, opening up a floodgate of a whole generation protesting the civil code.”

By comparison, Strub continued, “The action at St. Pat’s was the first time we did that against the religious and moral code. We did the unthinkable and took it to their turf. And I think that also opened up the floodgates. Right about then marked a peak moment of influence for the Catholic Church in America. It has declined ever since not just because of that action. It was the sex scandals and all that.”

Sure enough, he said, “We took [Church leaders] down a peg, and they never recovered in terms of their political influence. In a sense, that St. Pat’s action ranks up there with Stonewall in terms of importance.”

Monosaccharide Derivatives with Low-Nanomolar Lectin Affinity and High Selectivity Based on Combined Fluorine-Amide, Phenyl-Arginine, Sulfur-π, and Halogen Bond Interactions.
The design of small and high-affinity lectin inhibitors remains a major challenge because the natural ligand binding sites of lectin are often shallow and have polar character. Herein we report that derivatizing galactose with un-natural structural elements that form multiple non-natural lectin-ligand interactions (orthogonal multipolar fluorine-amide, phenyl-arginine, sulfur-π, and halogen bond) can provide inhibitors with extraordinary affinity (low nanomolar) for the model lectin, galectin-3, which is more than five orders of magnitude higher than the parent galactose; moreover, is selective over other galectins.

Abstract. To achieve very high data rates (>109 bits/s) in optical data storage systems it is necessary to employ a large number of laser beams for parallel read–write–erase operations. Bringing all these beams to diffraction-limited focus with a high-numerical-aperture objective lens (while maintaining focus and tracking) requires techniques that are fundamentally different from those that are currently practiced in the field of optical data storage. We present two possible solutions to the problem of designing an objective lens for such systems, one involving an array of high-quality lenslets and the other based on a single, high-numerical-aperture annular-field-of-view conventional lens. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, on which we elaborate in the course of our discussions.. © 1999 Optical Society of AmericaFull Article | PDF Article

Abstract. This paper analyses the changing nature of relationships between adults and young people. Adopting aspects of the work of Frank Furedi, the question of the socialisation of children is addressed. It is argued that the problematisation of behaviour, coupled with the development of new state and institutional processes, has led to a growing spread of ‘professional’ and contractual involvement in everyday life. This is something that relates to and is accelerated by the emergence of micro-politics and micro-social policy over the last few decades. This colonisation of the lifeworld, it is argued, is increasingly formalising informal relationships and undermining spontaneous relationships between adults and young people. It also distorts the nature of professions and the relationships developed between them and young people. The real relationships between adults and young people are consequently being undermined and replaced by an ersatz form of socialisation.

Psychiatric disorders and general medical conditions: implications for the clinician.
Patients with severe mental illness have higher than expected prevalence rates of co-morbid general medical conditions, particularly metabolic and cardiovascular disease. They are also at increased risk of contracting HIV. Conversely, these and other medical disorders also increase the risk of developing mental disorders. Mental illness and general medical conditions have mutually adverse effects on long-term outcome. This interaction of diseases contributes significantly to the excess morbidity in and higher than expected standard mortality ratios for patients with mental illness. As medical practice becomes more specialized and arguably compartmentalized it may increasingly fail to integrate health care for patients with severe mental illness. In this paper we discuss the high co-morbidity of mental illness with other medical disorders as well some of the potential mechanisms involved. We furthermore argue that the bidirectional relationship between mental and medical disorders should be considered in the planning of treatment for either group of disorders. The central role of the psychiatrist in co-ordinating and integrating the health care of patients with severe mental illness is emphasized.

In order to improve viewing angle dependency of γ characteristics of a liquid crystal display device (e.g. prevent excess brightness etc. of a screen), there have been proposed liquid crystal display devices (based on a pixel-division system, see Patent Literature 1 for example) for controlling a plurality of sub-pixels in one pixel so that the plurality of sub-pixels have different luminances and displaying a halftone by area coverage modulation of these sub-pixels.
FIG. 49 is a schematic view showing an example of a pixel structure of a liquid crystal display device 1000 of Patent Literature 1. The liquid crystal display device 1000 includes a scanning signal line 1002 and a data signal line 1003 that are provided on a glass substrate 1001 and a pixel 1004 provided in the vicinity of an intersection of the two signal lines. The pixel 1004 consists of two sub-pixels 1005a and 1005b. The two sub-pixels 1005a and 1005b include transistors 1006a and 1006b and pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b connected with the transistors 1006a and 1006b, respectively, and the pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b form capacitors (retention capacitors 1009a and 1009b) with retention capacitor lines 1008a and 1008b, respectively. Although not shown, the pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b are designed such that a liquid crystal material (liquid crystal layer) is sandwiched between the glass substrate 1001 and a common electrode (counter electrode) on a surface of a substrate (color filter substrate).
FIG. 50 is a drawing showing an electrically equivalent circuit corresponding to the pixel structure shown in FIG. 49 of the liquid crystal display device 1000. The pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b shown in FIG. 49 correspond to points 1010a and 1010b shown in FIG. 50, respectively, and form liquid crystal capacitors 1012a and 1012b, respectively, with a common electrode 1011.
In the above configuration, different signals are supplied to the retention capacitor lines 1008a and 1008b, respectively. This allows differentiating potentials (pixel potentials) of the pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b from each other.

Article Text. Abstract. Suppression scotomas and retinal projection (retinal correspondence) were measured in six intermittent exotropes during deviation. Measurements used red-green anaglyph stimuli presented on a black background which could be varied from 3.4 minutes of arc to 3 degrees 24'. Results showed non-suppression of all points between the fovea and the diplopia point. Harmonious anomalous retinal correspondence was usually observed. Two subjects had spontaneous changes from anomalous retinal correspondence to normal retinal correspondence without a concurrent change in ocular position. Conventional testing resulted in more variable results in regard to retinal correspondence and suppression, suggesting that non-suppression and anomalous retinal correspondence occur when black backgrounds are used.

Effect of Wnt inhibitors in pancreatic cancer.
Activated Wnt signaling in cancer cells leads to cell proliferation. It has been shown that the Wnt pathway is activated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. Therefore, we tested the effect of Wnt inhibitors in human and murine pancreatic cancer cell lines. The Wnt inhibitors ethacrynic acid (EA), ciclopirox olamine (CIC), piroctone olamine (PO) and griseofulvin (GF) were tested in murine and human pancreatic cancer cell lines with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. We showed that the Wnt inhibitors significantly reduced cell viability in murine, as well as human pancreatic cancer cell lines. These results may lead to a new therapeutic option with Wnt inhibitors for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Motives and health-related behaviours: an investigation of equipotentiality and equifinality.
We investigated the phenomena of equipotentiality (one dispositional motive expressed through more than one behaviour) and equifinality (one behaviour serving more than one motive). In a cross-sectional survey, 244 young adults completed measures of sun-related behaviour and risky sexual behaviour, participatory motives for the behaviours and life goals (representing dispositional motives). Equipotentiality was demonstrated, in that power and diversity life goals each predicted more than one behaviour. Equifinality was demonstrated, in that sun exposure and risky sexual behaviour were each predicted by more than one life goal. Participatory motives mediated these relationships. Equipotentiality and equifinality need to be taken into account in health promotion.

Developing academic leaders in Geriatric Psychiatry with clinical/educational and research expertise is a national priority. This proposal is designed to developed the nominee's capability as an independent researcher and resource person in geriatric psychiatry at MCV/VCU. Specifically, the nominee plans to: a) pursue additional training in statistics and epidemiological research methods; b) pursue research supervision from senior faculty at the university and external experts in geriatric psychiatry; c) develop research programs expanding clinical understanding of aggressive behavior in Alzheimer's Disease patients; and d) establish a network of research at MCV/VCU to promote collaborative research in geriatric mental health.

As one of high speeding techniques of image display in an information display control system, there is a technique of using an atlas image (also referred to as a “texture atlas”) in which a plurality of images are unified into one image. Since the plurality of images can be taken out of one texture atlas, the texture atlas is created in advance, whereby a number of readout times of image files is reduced, and a readout time of image data can be shortened.
In an event of creating the texture atlas, it is a challenge to determine how to efficiently arrange the plurality of images, which are different from one another in size, on the texture atlas. In usual, since the images for use in the information display control system are rectangular, this challenge can be handled as a “rectangle packing problem” in which rectangles are arranged on a two-dimensional surface with a fixed area without overlapping one another. A variety of approximate methods are known with regard to the rectangle packing problem. For example, the Best-fit method proposed in following Non-Patent Literature 1 is an algorithm that repeatedly packs rectangles which can use gaps to the maximum.

Inhibition of aflatoxin B1-induced gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase positive (GGT+) hepatic preneoplastic foci and tumors by low protein diets: evidence that altered GGT+ foci indicate neoplastic potential.
Previous studies in this laboratory with young Fischer 344 male rats have shown that the post-initiation development of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase positive (GGT+) hepatic foci was markedly inhibited by low protein feeding, even though the energy intake was greater. This dietary effect, however, did not necessarily apply to hepatic tumor development. Thus, the present investigation was undertaken to examine this dietary effect upon the development of hepatic tumors and, is so doing, to determine the correlation of foci development with tumor development. Following AFB1 dosing (15 daily doses of 0.3 mg/kg each), animals were fed diets containing 6, 14 or 22% casein (5.2, 12.2, 19.1% protein) for 6, 12, 40, 58 and 100 weeks. Foci at 12 weeks and tumors at 40, 58 and 100 weeks developed dose-dependently to protein intake. Foci development, tumor incidence, tumor size and the number of tumors per animal were markedly reduced while the time to tumor emergence was increased with low protein feeding. Non-hepatic tumor incidence also was lower in the animals fed the lowest protein diet. Foci development indices (foci number, per cent liver volume occupied) were highly correlated with tumor incidence at 58 and 100 weeks (r = 0.90-1.00). Tumor and foci inhibition occurred in spite of the greater energy intake.

The lucky numbers were initially thought to be a way to tell the Tazos apart (i.e. 45 is the highest lucky number, so the thought was that it would be a set of 45), but this has been found to be untrue, and, if sorting Tazos based on their Lucky Numbers, then many gaps will appear in the set. There has, however been found to be only the 3 variations per Tazo, making a complete set of only 30.

Personal Information on Students Slip from Teacher’s PC onto Internet

Personal information relating to around 10,000 students slipped onto the net when a high school teacher in Ichinomiya, Aichi Prefecture, used file-sharing software on his computer that stored the records, the prefecture's board of education said on June 30, 2007.

According to assumptions, the information leaked due to a virus in file-swapping program from a computer located in the residence of the 43-year old teacher employed at Ichinomiya Technical Upper Secondary School.

The teacher said that apart from the students' information, his PC also had the list of ASDF (Association of Synchronous Data Formats) officers who retired from service. His mother had asked him to compile it. She was attached to the Self-Defense Forces, the board of education said, as reported by The Japan Times on July 1, 2007.

The board also reported that the divulged data included records on students of two different schools where the teacher worked. That comprised of 10-years records of 7,000 students from his current school and 5-years records of 7,545 students form his previous school. The information consisted of students' names, birth dates, parents' names and grades.

The exact number of students affected due to the leak is not known as some of the records were in duplicates, the board said. The leak consisted of around 14,600 pieces of information. Personal information relating to personnel of the Air Self -Defense Force's Gifu Air Base in Kakamigahara, Gifu Prefecture, was also leaked from the teacher's computer. The leaked data included rolls of retired staff and everything about the events that took place at the base.

The education board said the leaked information was actually internal data saved since the academic year 1994 at the Technical Upper Secondary School and a high school where the teacher had worked earlier. The information collected was for the purpose of assisting students in choosing their careers. Therefore, it included students' names, careers they wished, academic results, technical school and university entrance exam results, and character evaluations.

The Board said there were no reports of misuse of data so far. But it will apologize to students and their parents and will take action against the teacher.

Democratic leaders are scrambling after a hashtag went viral on Twitter by fed-up Democrats that are walking away from the party. Former Dem loyalists are tired of the far-left rhetoric and alt-left violence — and that’s trouble for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and company come November.

The #Walkaway movement was started by a registered Democrat that decided to walk away from liberalism after deciding that the party was taking advantage of its own racial, sexual, and religious minorities in America.

The campaign quickly caught on with social media users sharing their own walk away stories.

Actor James Woods joined in on the movement sharing his story behind leaving the Democratic party.

Hi, I just recently started looking at HTML5 and noticed the video tag. Neat addition. I also noticed that it as an attribute named 'pixelratio', however, as you know this is never an integer, but rather is the result of a fraction (i.e. ratio). As for proper playback of video frames, it is important to understand exact float and therefore I would suggest either expressing it as a ratio of two 32-bit integers separated by a colon (or slash) or use two different attributes. This avoids unintentional rounding. Something roughly along the lines of: <video pixelratio="10:11"> <!-- 525 composite NTSC --> <video pixelratio="59:54"> <!-- 625 composite PAL --> <video pixelratio="1018:1062"> <!-- 1920x1035 HDTV SMPTE RP 187-1995 --> <video parhSpacing="10" parvSpacing=11"> Container formats tend to store this information in a ratio like this and not in a float.

A couple of months ago, we got excited because we saw Charlton station had gained a new water fountain. It was all part of a London-wide plan to provide more drinking water taps, and reduce the need for people to buy plastic bottles of water. There was a heatwave on, it sounded fantastic.. Then a few weeks after it opened, it was covered up again. And moved. It’s still covered up today. Our refillable bottles have remained unfilled.. We asked Thames Water what was going on. A spokesperson got back to us very quickly and told us: “At the moment the water coming from the fountain isn’t of the standard we’d expect so we can’t let anyone use it until it passes all the right tests.”. Thames Water emphasises there is no issue with water in the wider area – it’s just an issue that affects the fountain.. Hopefully the fountain will be back in service soon.

Statement. My father became a street photographer when he was eighteen in the late 1960’s, and ever since he documented life around him as it is - with artistic thought, but also a quickness of catching the moment as it’s being created. I was always extremely in awe of his work and soon, when he gave me a film camera for my 16th birthday, I started following his path of catching the moments around me.

Can a hill vanish? Apparently yes!

At least that is what the Rajasthan government has told the Supreme Court. During the hearing of a case related to the illegal minings in Aravalli, the Rajasthan Government told the Apex Court that 28 out of 138 hills in Aravalli region near Delhi border have disappeared.

The Supreme Court bench comprising Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta was, however, not convinced, and asked the government if people had become Hanuman and they are running away with the hills.

The court which observed that Rajasthan has taken the issue of illegal mining "very lightly" and ordered the government to stop all illegal mining in a 115.34-hectare area in Aravalli hills within 48 hours.

The apex court also referred to a central empowered committee report that 31 hills or hillocks have vanished in the state's Aravalli area.

The court also noted that the disappearance of hills in Rajasthan could be one reason for the rise in pollution levels in Delhi.

A Message from Our CEO. Dear Guests,.. My vision is to provide a sanctuary for each and every guest in a peaceful environment that will allow for relaxation, rejuvenation and a place to re-energize ones’ spirit. We are all “caretakers” in one way or another and often we forget about the person most important – ourselves. Caretakers often forget that “self-care” is tremendously important. We must all remind ourselves that giving time to yourself is not selfish. Taking care of one’s “SELF” first, makes taking care of others so much easier.. Namaste,. Julie Nguyen

Archive Article: 1997/12/12. From Arthur Staniforth, Summertown, Oxford. The first tractor I drove was a Fordson "red-spot". It was fitted with spade lugs and belonged to the Somerset War Agricultural Committee.. A student at Reading University, my holiday job was to go round ploughing up grass fields that had been scheduled by the War Ag. I had the old road menders caravan to live in and steel bands to put round the tractor wheels for road travel.. It was good tractor and pulled a two-furrow Ransome plough. Petrol was used for start up with TVO being switched to when it had warmed up. Starting it in the morning was the hardest part – it took some swinging and had a kick like a mule: Never put your thumb round the handle.. By present day standards the seat was incredibly uncomfortable and I spent most of the time when ploughing standing up – there was just enough room for that.

Brattain–Hadley House

The Brattain–Hadley House was located in Springfield, Oregon and was formerly listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Fire destroyed much of the house in 1997, and in 2012 a demolition contractor removed the house for safety reasons.

Paul Brattain, an 1852 pioneer, obtained a 160-acre donation land claim soon after moving from Iowa to Oregon. The Brattain farm was entirely within modern Springfield city limits.

When Brattain died in 1893, his descendants built the Queen Anne style house. Paul Hadley, Brattain's grandson, was the last of Brattain's descendants to occupy the house in the 1940s. Hadley's daughter, Mary Hadley Callis, allowed vagrants to occupy the house until the 1997 fire.  The house was removed from the National Register on May 8, 2012.

I only started reading this book because my grandma gave it to me for christmas and told me that it was "a wonderful book that made me think of you". I put off reading it for about 6 months but then I didn't have any new books to read so I picked this one up. Belive me, I don't like reading non-fiction books, so it's pretty amazing that a real-life story about a cat pulled me in so fast. It's a really interesting yet funny book, so good that I made excuses to use it for my "survival" unit in school. *warning* I got a little bit tierd with all of the cat stuff as the book went on.

The ERA Toronto team recently had the privilege to head out to LA for a few days and join up with our LA team to do a few rooms in the area between our visits to Hollywood and Six Flags. One of the companies we got to visit during our trip was Xscape Pods. Xscape Pods are a relatively new company, having been in business for just over a year. They’re a small, family-owned company who have done a good job of coming up with some cool and unique room designs.

Finding our way to Xscape Pods was fairly straightforward. They’re located in a strip mall, so there was plenty of parking, and they had a nice big sign above their storefront. The lobby was very creatively decorated, with quite a sci-fi feel, some nice comfy couches, and a few unique and interesting decorations. We were given a warm welcome by the owners, after which we watched a short rules video and then we were off to play the room! The intro video was shown in the room itself; unfortunately, due to some technical difficulties, we only got to see about the first half, but it was still enough to get the gist and set the tone for the game to come.

The room itself felt slightly spartan, but this was appropriate given that it was supposed to be a generic government office. The props felt authentic enough and got the job done, although a few of them were starting to show signs of some wear and tear. One puzzle was a little bit fiddly, but another puzzle did a good job of making use of a cool, high-tech prop that really added to the atmosphere.

The immersion was decent, with background music and sound effects evoking a military base. Again, we missed out on some of the intro video due to technical difficulties, so the story was a little unclear, and there didn’t appear to be much by way of story development as we progressed. One cool reveal helped pull us back into the story for a bit, but at other times we were simply going through the motions.

Similarly, the puzzles generally felt merely competent. There were no team-building puzzles, no big “wow” moments, and quite a few coding/decoding puzzles. Most things made sense, and there weren’t any large leaps of logic required, but at a few points we found ourselves a little lost and unsure what to tackle next.

In the end, we did enjoy ourselves while playing this room, but weren’t necessarily blown away by it. There were a few cool moments, but nothing that really made it stand out. Overall though still a solid room and worth playing should you find yourself in the area.

It is common in many industries that various materials or mixtures of materials require drying at some stage of processing. One example is the drying of (i.e. the removal of water from) coal and coal wash fines in the mining industry. Traditionally, industrial drying has been accomplished through application of heat to bring a moisture laden material to elevated temperatures so that the moisture will evaporate and/or boil away from the material. This approach, however, requires large amounts of energy to produce and apply the heat. This energy is usually derived from the burning of fossil or other fuels, which is not very efficient, is not generally eco-friendly, and in fact is a pollution generator in its own right. At least partially for these reasons, the burning of fossil fuels in the coal mining industry to dry material such as coal wash fines is strictly regulated.
In addition to drying needs, there are industrial needs for transitioning a substance with a vapor pressure threshold from one phase to another phase. Examples include, distilling, mixing, desalinating, recovering oil from oil shale and oil sands, recovering purified distilled water from contaminated water, distilling alcohols from a mash or other mixture, and many others. Desalinization of seawater to produce potable water is one example of a desalinating application. Traditional techniques for desalinizing seawater have tended to require large amounts of externally generated energy in the form of heat, which, again, usually involves the burning of fossil fuels, is exceedingly inefficient, and generally is not eco-friendly. Artificial snow-making also is an industry where the making of artificial snow from water is energy intensive and inefficient, and produces a poor substitute for natural snow. Pond evaporation is another example of an industry that consumes large amounts of energy to produce heat for boiling water or other substances, pollutes the atmosphere, and is generally inefficient. The above examples represent only a few throughout various industries.
A need exists for methods and systems to perform these and many other related industrial tasks more efficiently, using much less energy, requiring the addition of little or no externally generated heat or thermal energy, and in a manner that produces little or no harmful atmospheric emissions and thus is eco-friendly. It is to the provision of such methods and systems that the present disclosure is primarily directed.

Demons Training Session

Natalie did a surprise appearance at a Demons AFL training session in Melbourne this Wednesday. In town for this weekend’s NGV Gala, she took time out to check out how the Dees were coming along in pre-season.

Apparently, Natalie’s best friend, a big Demons supporter, was the reason behind her visit. Their children took part in the warm-up with the players.

Natalie also donned an AFLW guernsey and there were plenty of fans on social media who were happy with her choice of club. As usual, Zimbio has several photos:

Effect of protein kinase C on amylase secretion and cyclic AMP production in rat pancreatic acinar cells.
The authors examined the effects of protein kinase C on secretin-induced amylase release and cyclic AMP production in rat pancreatic acinar cells. Secretin (10(-6) M) and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (10(-6) M) induced 53% and 60% increase of amylase release from the basal level, respectively during 10 min. Simultaneous addition of TPA and secretin resulted in 42% amylase release from the basal level for 10 min. Suppression of secretin-induced amylase release was evident within 5 min of pretreatment with TPA. TPA showed the same effect on cyclic AMP production; secretin-induced increase of cyclic AMP was suppressed by pretreatment of TPA for 5 min. To explore the mechanism by which TPA inhibits secretin-induced cyclic AMP production, we also examined the effects of protein kinase C purified from rat brain on adenylate cyclase activity in pancreatic acinar membranes. Basal, forskolin- and secretin plus guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]trisphosphate-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity were inhibited by protein kinase C in the presence of Ca++. These results suggest that protein kinase C might have a role in the inhibitory effect on adenylate cyclase in exocrine pancreas.

Transcendental and Optimized Digital Designing Using Reversible Logic. The approach in the reversible logic design differs significantly from the traditional combinational logic design. In reversible logic circuit, the number of input lines should be equal to the number of output lines with each output line being used only once thereby making the resulting circuit acyclic. Thus a reversible logic gate is an n-input, n-output device with one-to-one mapping. This helps in the determination of the outputs from the inputs and vice-versa, i.e. there is one-to-one correspondence between the input and the output vectors..

Lee, Rona (2009) Truthing Gap. [Show/Exhibition]Full text not available from this repository.. Abstract. Oceanographic survey offers no grounding in questions of representation, such as mapping as an expression of power, or inter-subjective relations between observer and observed. Existing practice involves the reprocessing of sonar data to create drained and illuminated, photorealistic, virtual models, over which the disembodied eye may freely roam.. Situated and ‘situationist’, Truthing Gap employed conjectural understanding, participant observation (work with geophysical modelling/mapping software and underwater vehicles/cameras), performative experiments and interventions, alongside alternative modes of data capture and making tactile cartographies, to address the role of representational vocabularies in configuring human/non-human relations and the capacity of contemporary artistic practice to re-think dominant environmental imaginaries..

I just came across an interesting article by Jeffrey Joerres on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal Europe (April 9, 2009) entitled Aging Your Work Force. The article is about the challenge of an aging workforce in Europe and says that “a loss of productivity and intellectual capital as baby boomers leave the work force could devastate some businesses. Europe’s work force will begin shrinking in the coming years and is expected to become 15% smaller within five decades, according to the OECD. The countries with the biggest threat are those with the oldest populations, particularly Germany and Italy.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering applying 25 percent tariffs on around $3.5 billion of imports from the United States if President Donald Trump carries out his plan to apply global duties to steel and aluminum, EU sources say.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

The European Commission has said it would respond “firmly” to proposed U.S. import duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.

It has spelt out it would join others in a challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and consider safeguard measures, last deployed in 2002, to guard against steel and aluminum being diverted to Europe from elsewhere if U.S. tariffs come in.

A further counter-measure under consideration would specifically target the United States to “rebalance” trade between the two, EU sources say.

The U.S. tariffs would be officially brought in on grounds of national security, but the European Union says U.S. military requirements represent no more than 3 percent of U.S. production and that the measures are really a form of protectionism for U.S. manufacturers.

EU exports of steel to the United States in 2017 were worth 5.3 billion euros ($6.53 billion) and of aluminum 1.1 billion euros.

For certain grades of steel, the United States cannot show there was any increase of imports last year, the EU sources say, meaning it would not be allowed to apply safeguard measures to them. For the EU, exports of those grades amounted to 2.8 billion euros ($3.5 billion).

Assuming U.S. tariffs fully covered EU steel, the European Union would put forward 25 percent tariffs on 2.8 billion euros worth of goods from the United States.

About a third would be steel grades, another third other industrial products and a final third agricultural products.

The list of products is set to be presented next week to EU countries, whose approval would be needed.

The “rebalancing” would have to take place within three months.

Explanation of implants is indicated for implant rupture, infection, extrusion, siliconoma, breast pain, painful capsular contracture, malposition, significant patient fear, and systemic symptoms thought secondary to implants. A number of alternatives are available for postexplant reconstruction, including myocutaneous flaps and free tissue transfers.

It's been a long journey, but puzzle platformer Yumi's Odd Odyssey, known as Farewell Umihara Kawase in Japan, will finally be available on the North American 3DS eShop on March 20th, according to publisher Natsume:

This is the first time the series has ever ventured outside of Japan in its 2-decade history, but Natsume has expressed in interviews its desire to bring the latest game to overseas fans, and that digital distribution has been seen as a good way of helping lower the risks and costs involved.

The titular protagonist of Yumi's Odd Odyssey wields a fishing line and hook, swinging, flinging, and navigating herself through a multitude of levels. The series has drawn a cult following of fans outside Japan who came across its unique style in various ways, including a playthrough of the original Super Famicom title on GameCenter CX. No official word has been given regarding a potential release of Yumi's Odd Odyssey in Europe or Australia.

Will you bite on Yumi's Odd Odyssey, or is it just not hooking you? Let us know in the comments.

Sheltair's new $25 million hangar-office complex now open

Aviation development company Sheltair will celebrate the grand-opening of its new $25 million westside office-hangar complex at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport Wednesday, Nov. 13. In October, Sheltair completed the 134,806 square foot facility on more than 11 acres of land on the west side of the airfield, as part of a three-phase development project. (Arlene Satchell)

The roughly $25 million complex marks the completion of the first phase of a three-part development project at the Fort Lauderdale facility that's expected to be done in 2015, Sheltair said.

The aviation development company, which has 20 airport facilities in Florida, New York and Georgia, provides fuel, ground handling and other services to owners and operators of corporate and leisure aircraft. It also builds and leases hangars and office space to aviation-related companies.

"Sheltair strives to be on the cutting edge of aviation construction and development, and this project coupled with the advantages and growth potential at this airport is and will be a wonderful example in the aviation community," Sheltair CEO Jerry Holland said in a statement.

Work on the 134,806-square-foot facility at 1470 Lee Wagener Blvd. was completed in October after breaking ground in April 2012. Spread across more than 11 acres, the complex is the first new general aviation facility to be built on the airport's west side in more than a decade, according to Sheltair.

Increased demand for its services, customers' expanding fleets and the Fort Lauderdale airport's rising international profile were among reasons for the expansion, company officials have said. Sheltair is also seeking to grow its business from Brazil, Mexico, Canada and Europe.

"We are pleased Sheltair Aviation has decided to expand their facilities at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport," said Kent George, the airport's director of aviation.

Beside its traditional services, Sheltair also manages the country's busiest general aviation federal inspection station for international flights here in Fort Lauderdale, George noted.

Tenants in the new facility will have access to Sheltair's round-the-clock terminal, which offers aircraft refueling, cleaning, a 24-hour U.S. Customs office, Hertz car rental, cafe and executive boardroom and other amenities. They'll also have direct access to the airport's new 8,000-foot south runway, now under construction and set to open September 2014.

I ask because I have just ordered some laying pullets expecting chicks on the 28th and today found one of my hens who has been slacking big time on the egg production on the nest. I thought nothing of it and came back later to collect her egg; She was gone from the nest but she had pulled off alot of feathers and looks like she is getting ready to brood. It's bad timing of coarse with all the chicks on the way but maybe I will put a few of my Light Brahma x silkie eggs under her and see if they will hatch. That way if she decides to leave the nest after a few days I won't be so disappointed.

ShinBit is receiving a Melarsomine injection to kill the adult heartworms. So Melarsomine is an adulticide and is the Immiticide referred to in the heartworm treatment report.. Remember the adult worms can live in the heart and pulmonary arteries which is why heartworms get their name. Melarsomine is the only medication currently being used to kill adult heartworms. Because it is injected into the muscles of the back, the injections can be painful.. Doxycycline is also used to kill the Wolbachia organism infection that often accompanies heartworm disease. This organism is thought to also provide some sort of protection for adult heartworms and may cause inflammation in the lungs of the infected animal after the adult heartworms die.. The dying heartworms can cause obstructions in the blood vessels of the lungs. Exercise can increase the risk of an embolism and serious side effects so ShinBi must be kept quiet and inactive during his heartworm treatment.

WILL I HAVE TO EAT AND DRINK THINGS THAT I DON'T LIKE AND TAKE A LOT OF SUPPLEMENTS?

No! You'll never have to eat anything you don't like. But, you'll be encouraged to discover foods that support and nourish you. Over time your taste buds will change and you will start seeking out these foods naturally. With regards to food and drinks it's about switching to healthier options that are right for your body type, as opposed to whatever it is you may have been eating before. But, it's not about perfection - you'll learn to still enjoy 'treat' foods now and again without any bingeing or guilt.

You’ll never be pressured to take any supplements that are suggested to you.

​

CAN I DO THIS IF I HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION?

​

If you have a medical condition, then I recommend sharing the information with your physician/doctor. You can always adjust the meals to accommodate your health needs.

​

Note: This is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

I AM UNABLE TO EAT DAIRY OR GLUTEN AND HAVE OTHER FOOD INTOLERANCES, WILL THIS AFFECT MY ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE?

Not at all. You can list foods that you don't like or have an intolerance to and this is all incorporated into your profile. No matter what your eating habits look like now, this plan will help you to make them better.

​

HOW DOES THIS COURSE RUN?

The first session is creating your online profile and determining your body type through bone measurements and questionnaires. This usually takes one and half hours. After that it is an hour long one on one coaching session every fortnight. We can meet in person, online or over the phone - what ever suits you.

​

WHAT IF I FEEL TOO BUSY TO DO EVERYTHING?

Response of Triatoma infestans to pour-on cypermethrin applied to chickens under laboratory conditions.
This article reports the effects of a pour-on formulation of cypermethrin (6% active ingredient) applied to chickens exposed to Triatoma infestans, the main vector of Chagas disease in rural houses of the Gran Chaco Region of South America. This study was designed as a completely random experiment with three experimental groups and five replicates. Third instar nymphs were fed on chickens treated with 0, 1 and 2 cc of the formulation. Nymphs were allowed to feed on the chickens at different time intervals after the insecticide application. Third-instar nymphs fed on treated chickens showed a higher mortality, took less blood during feeding and had a lower moulting rate. The mortality rate was highest seven days after the insecticide solution application and blood intake was affected until 30 days after the application of the solution.

Allergy and Asthma: Allergic Rhinitis and Allergic Conjunctivitis.
Allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis are among the most common conditions seen in family medicine practice. Most cases are due to seasonal allergens, such as pollens, or year-round allergens, such as dust mites, mold, and animal dander. The clinical diagnosis can be made when symptoms of nasal congestion, sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal or ocular pruritus, or eye tearing are present along with physical findings, such as clear rhinorrhea, pale nasal mucosa, or red watery eyes. Patients should be assessed for any comorbid conditions, such as asthma or eczema, and for symptoms that indicate impaired quality of life, such as poor sleep, daytime somnolence, or irritability. Prevention involves allergen avoidance and environmental controls. Monotherapy with oral antihistamines, intranasal steroids, or intranasal antihistamines are the initial management options for nasal and ocular symptoms. Antihistamine eye drops are fast-acting and safe for management of ocular symptoms; intranasal antihistamines are effective for nasal symptoms. Current guidelines recommend against combining intranasal steroids and oral antihistamines, as this provides no additional benefit. Select patients also may benefit from allergy skin testing or consideration for allergen immunotherapy.

Semiconductor chip power is typically supplied on-chip at a single, predetermined voltage level. Chip designers typically specify a single, predetermined voltage level for reasons of standardization and convenience. Accordingly, as chip standards migrate from one on-chip voltage level to another, difficulties arise during transition periods. During such times of transition, new chips designed to operate at voltage levels according to the new standard voltage level may desirably be mounted on circuit boards and be incorporated into electronic systems designed to operate at the former standard voltage level.
Unfortunately, semiconductor chips designed to the new standard voltage will not generally make provision to accommodate the voltage level previously widely recognized and followed. It is typically presumed that either the entire electronics system into which the new chip design is to be incorporated will operate at the new voltage level, or that some off-chip solution will be provided to create voltage compatibility between subsystems and chips operating at separate voltage level.
Additionally, in the general case, a chip which operates at a given voltage level is not able to recognize that it has been provided with a nonstandard voltage level. There has been a failure of semiconductor chip designers to provide an on-chip solution for power provided at an arbitrary voltage level to be automatically converted to a desired internal operating voltage level. This creates serious compatibility problems for the semiconductor industry daring a period of accelerating miniaturization.
This increased miniaturization of chip geometries in the semiconductor industry makes it increasingly necessary to develop new solutions and chip designs which can accommodate a plurality of on-chip voltage levels. One aspect of the trend toward miniaturization is the use of increasingly thin gate oxide layers for CMOS devices fabricated in the industry. This has resulted in an increased recent motivation and an urgent need for semiconductor circuits to be able to accommodate both 5.0 volt and 3.3 volt on-chip voltage levels. It is anticipated that in the near future even lower on-chip voltage levels, such as for example 2.2 volts and 1.1 volts are likely to develop into the required circuit design norm.
It is accordingly an object of the invention herein to provide an on-chip voltage conversion solution for semiconductor chips manufactured during technology transition periods in which the semiconductor industry worldwide converts from one standard internal semiconductor chip voltage level to another.
It is an object of the invention herein to develop semiconductor circuit chips which are operable at a plurality of internal semiconductor chip voltage levels.
It is yet another object of the invention herein to provide an on-chip semiconductor design approach which converts internal voltage levels from a standard 5.0 voltage level to 3.3 volts.

Q:

central limit theorem VS standard deviation of multiple group means

I understand that we can estimate confidence interval of sample mean using CLT. However, I am wondering if we could treat mean value of each sampled group data as a single data entry and estimate their standard deviation to finish this calculation? Or where is wrong about this approach? An example,
If I have the following 4 groups of measurements, which follows normal distribution with mean=30, stand deviation=10. 
    group_mean  group_sd Ob1     Ob2     Ob3    Ob4     Ob5
group1  33.43   5.92    30.24   43.15   27.49   32.98   33.30
group2  28.92   11.04   32.42   38.83   32.14   31.32   9.91
group3  26.53   7.18    19.34   22.86   33.37   35.11   21.95
group4  28.26   7.43    21.09   28.13   23.19   40.24   28.66

If I treat each group mean as a data point (33.43, 28.92, 26.53, 28.26) and the mean is 29.29 and standard deviation (sample) is 2.94.
So can I assume the confidence interval of sample mean = 29.29 +/- t*2.94??
Thanks in advance!

A:

Theoretically, the standard error is the standard deviation for the sampling distribution.  In this case, what you have proposed is to sample from the sampling distribution 4 times (obtaining 4 means). The standard deviation of these values should provide an approximation for the standard deviation of the sampling distribution...i.e., the standard error. Conceptually, if you are using the correct $t$-distribution (using the correct degrees of freedom), it seems as though this should produce a reasonable result.
Follow-up
I am not convinced this strategy will work unless the correct degrees of freedom are used for the grouped means data set. Here is a brief simulation that shows that you obtain about 2% incorrect conclusions with a 98% confidence interval treating the data as an aggregate data set. But using the group means with different critical values does not produce the same results:

### set random seed
set.seed(1234)
### formula for CI:  x-bar ± t.cv * SD/√n
### t_cv for 98% confidence interval with df=19 (and others)
t.cv <- qt(1-0.02/2,19)
t.cv2 <- qt(1-0.02/2,4)
t.cv3 <- qt(1-0.02/2,16)
### generate data sets with mean 50 and stdev 10
n.sim <- 10^5
check.TF.1 <- rep.int(NA,n.sim)
check.TF.2 <- check.TF.1
check.TF.3 <- check.TF.1
check.TF.4 <- check.TF.1
grps <- ceiling({1:20}/5)
for(i in 1:n.sim) {
   x <- rnorm(20,50,10)
   grp.Ms <- aggregate(x~grps,FUN="mean")[,2]
   CI <- mean(x) + c(-1,1)*t.cv*sd(x)/sqrt(20)

Have you ever watched how contagious a yawn is? If one person in a group yawns, the entire group joins in. This can be explained by empathy. Lack of empathy is the key characteristic that distinguishes a true, pathological, dangerous narcissist, from someone that is just really, really, arrogant.

The same area of the brain is activated in yawn contagion as is activated by empathy. Autistic children, for instance, do not show yawn contagion. Is it possible, that narcissists do not shown yawn contagion either?

I need your help with this. This is what I would like you to do.

1. In a group of average people, friends, co-workers or in line at the store, fake a deep long yawn and then pay attention to how many people yawn as well. This is the control, the first step. It is important to know that your fake yawn works with normal people.

2. If the step above does not result in other people yawning, work on your yawn until it is contagious reliably.

3. Yawn, in a way that you know elicits others to yawn with someone that you know is a narcissist. Observe their response.

4. Report back here, yes or no, whether or not known narcissists have yawn contagion.

One final appeal. This would be an incredibly useful and handy tool if it is accurate. What we don’t know right now is if it is accurate, so I would like you to try it. I know that many of you know narcissists! Please try this. If we had a simple, socially acceptable tool for pre-screening people for narcissism, think of how much simpler our lives would be.

Happy Yawning…

Doors of the European Union (EU) are open for Montenegro- this is what the President of European Parliament Antonio Tajani told in an interview with the public broadcaster of Montenegro (TVCG).

Montenegro is the leader among countries wishing to join the EU and that should happen in 7 years, Tajani also said. “We love Montenegro and we want to cooperate with it. Our doors are open for Montenegro.”

Despite challenges the EU has been recently facing (e.g. the next-year election, Brexit, migrant crisis and the enlargement policy), Tajani hopes our country will join the EU by 2025.

“We have 7 years more. Montenegro could become the full EU member state if only we worked hard. We also have to improve the stability of the EU. Montenegro is a frontrunner for 2025 EU membership,” Tajani told.

The European Parliament President emphasizes our country plays a key role for the stability of the Western Balkans, which is also very important for the stability of the EU.

Two Healthy Diets Modulate Gut Microbial Community Improving Insulin Sensitivity in a Human Obese Population.
Gut microbiota, which acts collectively as a fully integrated organ in the host metabolism, can be shaped by long-term dietary interventions after a specific diet. The aim was to study the changes in microbiota after 1 year's consumption of a Mediterranean diet (Med diet) or a low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet (LFHCC diet) in an obese population. Participants were randomized to receive the Med diet (35% fat, 22% monounsaturated) and the LFHCC diet (28% fat, 12% monounsaturated). The study was conducted in 20 obese patients (men) within the Coronary Diet Intervention With Olive Oil and Cardiovascular Prevention (CORDIOPREV) study, an ongoing prospective, randomized, opened, controlled trial in patients with coronary heart disease. We evaluated the bacterial composition and its relationship with the whole fecal and plasma metabolome. The LFHCC diet increased the Prevotella and decreased the Roseburia genera, whereas the Med diet decreased the Prevotella and increased the Roseburia and Oscillospira genera (P = .028, .002, and .016, respectively). The abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis (P = .025) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P = .020) increased after long-term consumption of the Med diet and the LFHCC diet, respectively. The changes in the abundance of 7 of 572 metabolites found in feces, including mainly amino acid, peptide, and sphingolipid metabolism, could be linked to the changes in the gut microbiota. Our results suggest that long-term consumption of the Med and LFHCC diets exerts a protective effect on the development of type 2 diabetes by different specific changes in the gut microbiota, increasing the abundance of the Roseburia genus and F. prausnitzii, respectively.

The Arabidopsis arenosa complex is closely related to the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Species and subspecies in the complex are mainly biennial, predominantly outcrossing, herbaceous, and with a distribution range covering most parts of latitudes and the eastern reaches of Europe. In this study we present the first comprehensive evolutionary history of the A. arenosa species complex, covering its natural range, by using chromosome counts, nuclear AFLP data, and a maternally inherited marker from the chloroplast genome [trnL intron (trnL) and trnL/F intergenic spacer (trnL/F-IGS) of tRNALeu and tRNAPhe, respectively]. We unravel the broad-scale cytogeographic and phylogeographic patterns of diploids and tetraploids. Diploid cytotypes were exclusively found on the Balkan Peninsula and in the Carpathians while tetraploid cytotypes were found throughout the remaining distribution range of the A. arenosa complex. Three centers of genetic diversity were identified: the Balkan Peninsula, the Carpathians, and the unglaciated Eastern and Southeastern Alps. All three could have served as long-term refugia during Pleistocene climate oscillations. We hypothesize that the Western Carpathians were and still are the cradle of speciation within the A. arenosa complex due to the high species number and genetic diversity and the concurrence of both cytotypes there.

Like many kids who grew up in the ’70s, Simon Pegg was always a fan of Star Trek. But he never imagined that one day, he would get to play a main character and act alongside one of his idols.

Simon Pegg landed the role of a lifetime when he became the new Scotty in the latest Star Trek series. But for the actor, his memories of Star Trek as a child were much different from those that others had. Pegg told MTV that he became a fan as a young boy, but not by watching the original series with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy.

The British actor said he learned to love the story through an animated series in the 1970s that came out after the original show ended.

“I was watching that before I saw the live-action show in the very early ’70s and then watching the original TV show in ’78 or ’79 when I was on holiday. BBC2 used to show it at 6 o’clock every night, so I’d watch it while I had my dinner,” Pegg said. “I used to just love it because it was this strange, odd, kind of thoughtful show that was all about sci-fi, which I love. I have very strong memories of it as a child.”

That inspired child grew up to be a successful actor and filmmaker, but nothing could compare to meeting one of his childhood heroes. Pegg was one of the only Spock fans who got to meet the actual character.

“What was weird was actually getting to act with Leonard Nimoy and acting with a character that I’ve known since I was a kid, not just the actor, but the character,” he said. “When Spock spoke to me as Spock, it was mind blowing.”

Pegg’s film The World’s End is in theaters now. He teamed up with actors he has worked with on many of his other films, including Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead.

The World’s End is about childhood friends getting older and going home again. Pegg said it came at the right time, and he is glad they waited to make the film they have been thinking about for years.

“I don’t think we could have made the film when we had the idea, because we needed another six years of living in order to say what we wanted to say,” he told The New York Times back in August.

The World’s End has already pulled in nearly $40 million worldwide. Star Trek Into Darkness is now available on Blu-ray and DVD.

"Mortal man," he said, "denounce the rulers of Israel. Prophesy to them, and tell them what I, the Sovereign Lord, say to them: You are doomed, you shepherds of Israel! You take care of yourselves, but never tend the sheep.

3
You drink the milk, wear clothes made from the wool, and kill and eat the finest sheep. But you never tend the sheep.

4
You have not taken care of the weak ones, healed the ones that are sick, bandaged the ones that are hurt, brought back the ones that wandered off, or looked for the ones that were lost. Instead, you treated them cruelly.

5
Because the sheep had no shepherd, they were scattered, and wild animals killed and ate them. 1

6
So my sheep wandered over the high hills and the mountains. They were scattered over the face of the earth, and no one looked for them or tried to find them.

7
"Now, you shepherds, listen to what I, the Lord, am telling you.

8
As surely as I am the living God, you had better listen to me. My sheep have been attacked by wild animals that killed and ate them because there was no shepherd. My shepherds did not try to find the sheep. They were taking care of themselves and not the sheep.

9
So listen to me, you shepherds.

10
I, the Sovereign Lord, declare that I am your enemy. I will take my sheep away from you and never again let you be their shepherds; never again will I let you take care only of yourselves. I will rescue my sheep from you and not let you eat them.

11
"I, the Sovereign Lord, tell you that I myself will look for my sheep and take care of them

12
in the same way as shepherds take care of their sheep that were scattered and are brought together again. I will bring them back from all the places where they were scattered on that dark, disastrous day.

13
I will take them out of foreign countries, gather them together, and bring them back to their own land. I will lead them back to the mountains and the streams of Israel and will feed them in pleasant pastures.

14
I will let them graze in safety in the mountain meadows and the valleys and in all the green pastures of the land of Israel.

15
I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will find them a place to rest. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken.

16
"I will look for those that are lost, bring back those that wander off, bandage those that are hurt, and heal those that are sick; but those that are fat and strong I will destroy, because I am a shepherd who does what is right.

17
"Now then, my flock, I, the Sovereign Lord, tell you that I will judge each of you and separate the good from the bad, the sheep from the goats.

18
Some of you are not satisfied with eating the best grass; you even trample down what you don't eat! You drink the clear water and muddy what you don't drink!

19
My other sheep have to eat the grass you trample down and drink the water you muddy.

20
"So now, I, the Sovereign Lord, tell you that I will judge between you strong sheep and the weak sheep.

21
You pushed the sick ones aside and butted them away from the flock.

22
But I will rescue my sheep and not let them be mistreated any more. I will judge each of my sheep and separate the good from the bad.

23
I will give them a king like my servant David to be their one shepherd, and he will take care of them. 2

24
I, the Lord, will be their God, and a king like my servant David will be their ruler. I have spoken. 3

25
I will make a covenant with them that guarantees their security. I will get rid of all the dangerous animals in the land, so that my sheep can live safely in the fields and sleep in the forests.

26
"I will bless them and let them live around my sacred hill. There I will bless them with showers of rain when they need it.

27
The trees will bear fruit, the fields will produce crops, and everyone will live in safety on his own land. When I break my people's chains and set them free from those who made them slaves, then they will know that I am the Lord.

28
The heathen nations will not plunder them any more, and the wild animals will not kill and eat them. They will live in safety, and no one will terrify them.

29
I will give them fertile fields and put an end to hunger in the land. The other nations will not sneer at them any more.

30
Everyone will know that I protect Israel and that they are my people. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken.

31
"You, my sheep, the flock that I feed, are my people, and I am your God," says the Sovereign Lord.

Café Yumm!

Café Yumm! is a fast casual restaurant chain with outlets in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.

Founded in Eugene, Oregon, Café Yumm! outlets focus on fast, casual, cheap, and healthy cuisine, and some menu items feature the company's original signature sauce.

History
Café Yumm! was founded in 1997 when owners Mary Ann and Mark Beauchamp converted their unsuccessful juice bar into a fast casual restaurant. Central to the new menu were the Yumm! Bowl and its Yumm! Sauce, both developed earlier by Mary Ann Beauchamp at her former restaurant, Wild Rose Café & Deli. The company opened a second location in Eugene in 1999 and a third in 2002, and in 2007 the company began to franchise. The chain grew to 15 locations by 2015, with two franchises in Bend, Oregon. 

The chain opened its 23rd location in Eagle, Idaho, in February, 2019, as part of a three-outlet plan that includes two future Boise locations.

Estimated annual revenue for the company is $10.1 million with an estimate of 54 employees.

Menu
The Café Yumm! menu consists of five categories: three sizes of rice bowls layered with organic beans, Yumm! Sauce, and Deluxe Toppings (shredded Tillamook® cheddar cheese, tomatoes, avocado, sour cream, black olives, and cilantro), sandwiches and wraps, salads, soups, and bentos. More than 50 percent of the food served at Café Yumm! restaurants is certified organic.

Yumm! Sauce 
Café Yumm! co-founder Mary Ann Beauchamp developed the recipe for Yumm! Sauce in the 1980's. The company's original signature sauce is made with a base of almonds, garbanzo beans, soy beans, lemon juice, oil, herbs, and nutritional yeast. The sauce is used on a variety of menu items at Café Yumm! restaurants and a commercial version of the sauce is sold in over 160 grocery stores throughout the Pacific Northwest and through the company's online store.

Reception and Awards

Café Yumm! has been named The Register-Guard's Readers’ Choice for "Best Lunch Bargain" and "Favorite Vegetarian" in readers' polls many times since 2009. The company was also recognized as "Most Environmentally Friendly Business" in 2009. Café Yumm! has been named in the Eugene Weekly's "Best Of" for a variety of awards including "Best Vegetarian", "Best Eats Under $8", and "Best Cheap Eats" from 2014 to 2018. 

QSR Magazine included Café Yumm! in the 2018 40/40 List of America's Hottest Startup Fast Casuals.

The basic hypothesis of this proposal is that the ability of alpha adrenergic agonists to stimulate the Na+ pump of vascular smooth muscle may be related to the activation of Na+ influx and/or intracellular Ca++ release which are alpha1-mediated events or the influx of extracellular Ca++ which is an alpha2-mediated event. The project will be aimed at investigating this hypothesis in both quiescent and proliferating cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. These culture systems may serve as a model of normal, differentiated vascular cells (quiescent) or as a model of certain disease states such as atherosclerosis or hypertension in which cells are proliferating. Cells maintained under quiescent or proliferating conditions will be characterized with respect to Na+ pump number by quantitating [3H]-ouabain binding, turnover rate of the Na+ pump by measuring ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake and numbers of alpha1 and alpha2 receptors by [3H]-prazosin and [3H]-yohimbine binding. After control values for each of these parameters have been determined, the short-term effects of selective alpha1 and alpha2 agonists and antagonists on Na+ pump rate will be monitored. The role of a particular receptor subtype or subtypes will be assesed by comparison of relative potencies of selective agonists and pA2 values of selective antagonists. A primary effect of alpha agonists in all cells possessing alpha receptors is the mobilization of extracellular or intracellular Ca++. Experiments will be performed to determine the role of Ca++ in alpha-mediated stimulation of the Na+ pump by manipulating these pools of Ca++ and observing the effects on alpha-mediated pump stimulation. An alternative mechanism may be an alpha-stimulated Na+ influx related to the activation of a membrane Na+-H+ exchanger. This possibility will be investigated by measuring changes in [Na+]i by flame photometry and [pH]i by uptake of the weak acid [14C]-DMO in the presence of selective alpha agonists and antagonists. It is also planned to assess the effect on Na+ pump parameters of long term incubations of vascular smooth muscle cells with alpha agonists. In addition, alpha receptor number will also be monitored. It is expected that significant data will be obtained regarding the control of active and passive ion movements in vascular smooth muscle. In view of the role that disturbances of ionic regulation are believed to play in hypertension, it is anticipated that these studies may contribute to the understanding of this disease process.

I've got Mongolia on my mind too.. I've spent 12 years living and studying in the US. Now I come to the conclusion that I should go back to Mongolia and contribute to its development through what I have learned in American schools. However, I am anxious about going back. One of the major fears that I have about going back is that there is a system in Mongolia that does not value academic and professional merit but promotes the power of connections and "buying" job posts. What would you advise to those like me who are contemplating a return to our homeland and pursue professional careers there? Thank you.

Joey Rosskopf (BMC Racing) won his second straight time trial title at the USA Cycling Pro Road Championships on Thursday in Knoxville, Tennessee.. The 28-year-old was strong throughout course, three laps of an 11.4-kilometer circuit totaling 34.2 kilometers. He set the fastest times at the early checkpoints and held on to finish with the day’s fastest mark of 39:46.. Sunweb’s Chad Haga finished second, 28 seconds down.. “I couldn’t have asked for better legs. It was pretty hard to match Chad Haga’s time on the first lap especially,” Rosskopf said. “I felt like I had the advantage to know the time checks, to base my own ride off of them. The only option to win is to go out and match the times and do better. If you fade, at least you tried. Luckily I felt good enough to do that.”. Brent Bookwalter gave BMC a third podium finisher, 34 seconds back.. Aevolo Cycling’s Gage Hecht delivered the fifth fastest time, two minutes down on Rosskopf, to finish as the day’s best-placed under-23 rider.

I.). Bueno, welcome to my new design! Hopefully, you’ll get to like it as I have. I based it on the theme called "Identity". The original, however, wasn’t fully compatible with WP2.5 — and it looked rather plain as is — so I had had to do some major recoding on the templates.. I did love my old theme very much ("Subtle for WordPress" by GluedIdeas), so here’s a tribute to it: a screen-capture of the blog just before I started upgrading WordPress and installing & tweaking the new theme.. Congrats Kuya Blogie.. Anyway, check out your screenshot’s MyBlogLog widget; I’m your latest visitor!. Hahaha.. Thanks, Mikko!. @Mikko – di ah.. ako ang latest.. check mo ulit.. hehe. ay sa screenshot pala. sorry ^_^

Epic are releasing a massive update to Fortnite’s Battle Royale map, splitting it up into different biomes and adding new types of play spaces, such as multi-story buildings and labyrinthine tunnel networks.

The map update is coming this week, but Epic can’t say which exact day it will arrive yet.

You can see some footage of the updated map in the developer diary posted last week:

Epic launched Fortnite’s Battle Royale mode back in September with a map the team knew they could improve. “One of the things we wanted to do to make it better was to add more points of interest to the map,” lead level designer David Spalinski tells me. “Points of interest act as areas for players to congregate and meet and fight over various weapons and other types of valuable loot. They’re also an opportunity to add unique elements of gameplay, specific to that particular point of interest.”

Spalinski isn’t talking about adding in new systems and mechanics, but how spaces themselves can drive different kinds of play. “We have a new point of interest called Tilted Towers that is a city area, [which adds] a unique style of gameplay by having taller buildings and a higher density of locations. Each building is kind of like a labyrinth and they’re all close to each other.”

Another lead level designer, Sidney Rauchberger, points to a new area called Shifty Shafts that “adds a contrasting kind of gameplay.” Rauchberger explains that is “essentially an underground mine. It’s very windy, it’s got a lot of close quarters, tight angles, it’s darker. It’s frantic.”

These new kinds of spaces will infuse the Battle Royale mode with a greater variety of play and, considering the way the map closes down as the circle of death shrinks, this can significantly affect how the late-game plays out. “Because the circle is going to determine where you will end,” Rauchberger says, “you’re going to be pushed into some interesting scenarios that will force you to adapt your style of play – games ending in the maze are going to be very tense.”

The new biomes, which see the map split into swamp, grasslands, farms, and mountains, aren’t just to give more visual variety, but also to give players the tools to better orientate themselves.

“You start to gain a little bit of memory,” Spalinski says, “like ‘Oh, I’m in the mountain area, that means I’m on the western side of the map’, or ‘I’m in the swamp areas, that means I’m on the southern side of the map’. It helps give you a sense of place.”

The team also took the opportunity to redress the current points of interest on the map. “A lot of that refreshing came from playing the game with the community, listening to their feedback, reading on the internet what people had to say about certain areas that they may love or hate,” Spalinski says. “People like to go to certain areas a lot of times or stay away from others, and we like to see why that is and try to make them a little it better.”

With that feedback in mind the team made minor adjustments to a number of locations, making them more appealing. “It could be as small as ‘Hey, this area doesn’t have enough ammo, it would be great if I didn’t have to leave it to keep fighting other people’. We listened to that kind of feedback and looked at and balanced the areas so they’re creating the kind of gameplay that our users desire.”

Epic say the update is only possible because of improvements they’ve made to how the engine streams in content. “Before we had to fit everything in at once,” Rauchberger says, “now we’re able to allocate more resources because we’re able to split up the world better.”

It also means that there is the possibility that Epic will do a similar scale of update to the map in the future. “We’re always trying to see if there’s space to continue to improve,” Spalinski says. “When we released initially, internally, we felt without our new streaming technology that there were certain things we were incapable of doing […] and there were certain things we didn’t know needed to be done until it was out there […] and the community had played it and it was just going to take a little it of time to collect the things we didn’t know.

“This map update addresses some of the things that we wanted to do and some of things we learned along the way. We’re most likely going to be able to repeat that process of learning about what we’re about to release and where the opportunities as a result of that and the community will be able to inform us to some degree.”

Sober Blood

Twenty-two years for a plastic chip
That says how long ago I quit
Don’t tell the truth that’ll never change
I still want to everyday

I gave up what was once my life
A family–my kids, my wife
And don’t you know not a day goes by
When I ain’t trying to make it right

If I’d only known all of the things that I know now
I can’t help but wonder how my life would have turned out
I might die alone although the papers may not show
That the sober blood of a good man is gone

I ain’t missed one of them meetings since
The day that I signed up for this
But the lessons learned won’t ever heal the pain
Of a family still suffering

On my knees, I ask the Lord
Questions that He’s heard before
Just what can I do for forgiveness now?
I ask of You this final hour

If I’d only known all of the things that I know now
I can’t help but wonder how my life would have turned out
I might die alone although the papers may not show
That the sober blood of a good man is gone

Here I stand at Heaven’s doors
Wondering why, not really sure
Then I hear a voice calling out my name
I guess it’s true that Jesus saves

If I’d only known all of the things that I know now
I can’t help but wonder how my life would have turned out
I might die alone although the papers may not show
That the sober blood of a good man is gone

Robert Kugler, with Bella

Robert Kugler, with Bella

Cruising through the streets of Philadelphia and exploring the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.

Rolling around a park in Cleveland.

Watching the water flow at Niagara Falls.

Standing atop a rock in the Adirondack Mountains in New York.

Hanging out at Harvard; chilling in front of Boston's Fenway Park.

It was the worst possible news you could get about your best buddy.

Bone cancer, so a leg is amputated. But it gets worse. The cancer’s spread to the lungs. Now it’s a terminal condition.

So what do you do?

Robert Kugler decide to take his best friend — a three-legged chocolate lab named Bella — on one last, legendary ride.

“This is one of the biggest connections I’ve ever had to another living being. I don’t care that it’s a dog,” said Kugler, who’s from Broken Bow, Nebraska.

A devastating diagnosis

Kugler found out last year that Bella was dying of cancer. He had adopted her as a puppy nine years ago and wasn’t anyway ready to let her go.

“I just didn’t want her to be gone one day when I came home,” he said.

So Kugler began with Bella a trip of a lifetime. Kugler’s a Marine vet, so they headed off to Chicago back in November to the Marine Corps Ball.

His social media feeds — Twitter, Facebook and Instagram — documented their travels as they headed from there to points east and south:

Bella posing in front of a mural in Detroit

getting petted by some Salvation Army bell ringers in Bowling Green, Kentucky

checking out the sunset over Lake Erie

rolling around a park in Cleveland

Watching the water flow at Niagara Falls

standing atop a rock in the Adirondack Mountains in New York

hanging out at Harvard; chilling in front of Boston’s Fenway Park

cruising through the streets of Philadelphia and exploring the Lincoln Memorial in Washington

Bella and Kugler have either camped out in his Toyota 4Runner or couch-surfed with his friends along the way. Kugler’s doing this trip, not just for Bella, but for others too.

“I want to inspire people to get outside and live,” he said. “Love each other for who we are and make friends.”

They’re now in Florida, on the Gulf coast side, enjoying St. Petersburg and the white sand beach in Siesta Key. Well, not totally enjoying them, since the Sunshine State’s intense heat is pretty rough on Bella.

“The cold is easier to combat with a dog than the heat,” Kugler joked. He says the waters are so warm in Florida right now that they’re not exactly “refreshing” to her.

So now Kugler’s thinking of heading west, stopping for a bit back home in Nebraska before introducing Bella to the nation’s majestic national parks, like Yellowstone and Yosemite. He hasn’t really planned it out with too much detail. And that’s part of the charm of this long goodbye.

“Continuing to move and see the country is a good excuse to spend time with my dog,” he said. Being spontaneous can sometimes be a headache, since it means spending a huge amount of time “figuring out where we’re going to sleep,” but it also means enjoying unplanned little adventures.

“You come across a little gravel road and wonder, ‘where does this go?'” So you make the turn and find out, Kugler said.

The greatest gift

Doctors gave Bella just six three to six months left to live last year; she’s survived much longer than that, but Kugler knows Bella’s time is drawing short. He said a few weeks ago, he watched her, playing in the waters on a beach and envisioned a peaceful end for her.

“Some days I’m completely prepared. I pictured her just swimming out to sea,” he said. “But there’s other days when I’m like, oh my God, I can’t bear the thought of it.”

But whenever and wherever it happens, he’ll be with her. It’s part of the job of being best buds with a dog.

“We take on these animals, which means we’re gonna take on their life and their passing,” Kugler said. “To be there with them when they pass is the greatest gift you can give anybody.”

When Bella’s gone Kugler said he’ll volunteer more, like he has in the past for organizations that help veterans, like Team Rubicon and Team Red, White & Blue. And yes, he’ll continue to hit the open road.

“I want the freedom to travel. I don’t want a home that’ll keep me in one spot.”

Until then, Kugler thinks we should all be a little more like Bella: “Wag more; bark less.”

My work stems from process. I enjoy learning new techniques and manipulating them in new ways. I work on a broad range of projects including clothing, upholstery, restoration, jewellery, painting and sculpture. I find that by keeping my practice broad different ideas feed into each other to produce more interesting results.. I also aim to make my work as sustainable as possible. I want my products to be cherished and cared for and to make people feel happy. I feel that texture and attention to detail play a part in this as they help people to feel connected to an object. Quality is also a major factor in the life span of a product so I try to ensure the best workmanship in all that I make.. I grew up on Telegraph Hill and I enjoy the chance to take part in community projects such as the Hill Station.

Tasting Notes. Opici Homemade Style Barberone White is a full bodied wine made from a blend of white grapes. The wine has a full, slightly sweet floral aroma.

The Lawi overshoes made from lycra provide the cyclist with an aerodynamic advantage. The overshoes are very light weighted and due to the used fabrics, the shoe cover fits perfectly around your cycling shoe. On the underside of the product, a recess is applied to let the heel and the cleat come out of the overshoe.. In addition, to provide an aerodynamic advantage, the product also protects your cycling shoes against dirt. This is ideal for mountain biking or cycling during bad weather conditions. The product is therefore easy to wash out.

. Step over the stile into a world that no one knows exists. A world that overturns everything you know about the goodness of people and creates a mirror image of evil. Five years about I found this true story haunting, today I find it just as compelling. What you will see is the worst catastrophe you can imagine. When a young girl comes into a police station and claims her father is having sex with her, the authorities have no idea how big this situation is and how pervasive it is in the culture of a group of people that call themselves the Goler Clan. And it is not just a single act on one person but a whole series of crimes committed generation to generation. Truly there is no explanation that can be found, no escape from the depravity. The idyllic charm of the Annapolis Valley is penetrated by Evil so strong you can taste as you read. It enters your heart and mind never to let it go.

Construction News

A proposal to build a new 120-bed hospital in Albuquerque may be altered to allow for a smaller facility due to budgetary considerations.

After months of review and discussion, members of the University of New Mexico’s Board of Regents last summer agreed to let a project to build a new hospital advance to the design phase.

As proposed, the project would also include half a dozen operating rooms and clinical offices.

Initial plans additionally called for the hospital to be built on land owned by UNM just northeast of the University Boulevard and Lomas Boulevard intersection.

But now, some seven months after that vote, Dr. Paul Roth, UNM Health Sciences Center’s chancellor, has suggested a smaller facility may be more in order.

During a recent regents’ meeting, Roth said that although the need for more hospital beds remains unchanged, the university should conduct further studies before proceeding with what is anticipated to be a project that could cost as much as $250 million.

So far, the school has reserved some $200 million to build the hospital.

The project was earlier regarded as only the first phase in the eventual construction of a $684 million hospital with just over 400 beds.

UNM officials have long maintained that a new hospital is especially needed not just because it would provide more bed space, but also because the current structure built in the 1950s is no longer adequate for the hospital’s needs.

Telomere length and its relationship with chronic diseases - new perspectives for periodontal research.
The ageing process is accompanied by a variety of cellular modifications, and telomere shortening is a common finding. Large epidemiological studies have reported an association between shorter telomere length in peripheral leukocytes and several inflammatory diseases of the elderly including diabetes, atherosclerosis and, recently, periodontitis. The primary aim of this study was to critically discuss available evidence regarding the potential mechanisms relating shorter telomeres to periodontitis. A narrative literature review was performed to report evidence relating shorter telomeres to the ageing process and inflammation. Then, we searched MEDLINE (1950 to May 2012) and ISI WEB OF SCIENCE (1950 to May 2012) databases for the combination of the terms 'telomere' and 'periodontitis'. Although these associations suggest a possible role of telomere attrition in the onset or evolution of chronic inflammatory diseases, only two studies addressed the relationship between telomere length and periodontitis. We suggest that the chronic inflammatory burden observed in people with chronic periodontitis could represent the driver of telomere shortening. However, further evidence is needed to confirm whether inflammation is the cause or the consequence of the shorter leukocyte telomere length observed in people with periodontitis.

Pharmacokinetic changes of ipriflavone in rats with acute renal failure induced by uranyl nitrate.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of ipriflavone were compared after intravenous (20 mg/kg) and oral (200 mg/kg) administration in control rats and in rats with acute renal failure induced by uranyl nitrate (U-ARF rats). It was expected that the time-averaged nonrenal clearance (Cl(nr)) of ipriflavone in U-ARF rats could be significantly slower than in the control rats, since it was reported that ipriflavone was metabolized via the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1/2 and 2C11 and the expression and mRNA level of CYP1A2 were not changed, but those of CYP2C11 were decreased in U-ARF rats compared with control rats. Unexpectedly, after intravenous administration in U-ARF rats, the Cl(nr) of ipriflavone was significantly faster than in the controls (40.8 compared with 29.0 ml/min/kg). This may be due to an increase in the glucuronide conjugate formation of ipriflavone metabolites in U-ARF rats. After oral administration of ipriflavone in U-ARF rats, the AUC(0-24 h) was significantly smaller (194 compared with 295 microg min/ml) than in the controls.

Americans were voting in numbers unprecedented since women were given the franchise in 1920. Secretaries of state predicted turnouts approaching 90 percent in Virginia and Colorado and 80 percent or more in big states like Ohio, California, Texas, Missouri and Maryland.Though the exact numbers won't be determined until all the votes are counted in the next few days and weeks, a history-making high percentage of Americans voted, according to CNN and the Wall Street Journal:

More than 30 million voters had already cast ballots before Tuesday in early voting. Nearly 100 million more were expected on election day. Hundreds of thousands of voters waited from long before daybreak or for hours on end to make their choices known.

Michael McDonald, a politics professor at Virginia's George Mason University, predicted nearly 65% of the electorate would have voted by the time all polls closed -- matching or eclipsing the turnout in the presidential election of 1960 featuring candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Not since 1908, when the U.S. was convulsing through a shift from the machine party politics of the 19th century to the free-for-all of modern campaigns, has so large a proportion of Americans participated in a presidential election.

It was a good job! I'm glad you noticed. Maybe once you veer out of fantasyland you'll be able to see just how good a guy is that we just elected - smart, honest and articulate, all the things that the last President was not.

Grand Central Theatre. 33 Grand Central Terminal,. New York,. NY. 10017. 33 Grand Central Terminal,New York, NY 10017. 4 13 comments). Auditorium with 242 seats pictured in this 1937 trade report: Boxoffice. The April 1, 1937, issue of Motion Picture Daily said that the opening of the newsreel theater being built inside Grand Central Station had been set for May 3.. I passed by it many times but never went in. (In the early 1970’s, when I was going to college and Amtrak trains on the old New York Central lines were still leaving from Grand Central, I had to change stations in New York.) I distinctly recall that on one occasion, oe of the last times I saw the theater in operation, the program was the 1971 documentary “The Hellstrom Chronicle”, so the end must have come around 1973 or thereabouts.. Another thing: it probably was an inspiration for a strip in the comic series “Julis Knipl: Real Estate Photographer”, which takes place in such a theater.

New home, same life

New home, same life

My family and I finally moved into our house in the Diamond New Housing Scheme. I can’t say that I like it nor can I say I hate it. The traveling is hard and the morning traffic is harder but the place has a certain quietness to it that I like.

It’s been a long time since my mother, younger brother and I have shared a home together. At my age, I think I’ve spent too much time chasing life and chasing causes and not enough time seeing the people I love. A big part of loving people is witnessing their lives and caring about what you witness. I’ve been working on it.

And of course, I’ve got some interesting neighbours and naturally I’ve got that one neighbour that’s the epitome of jackassifiyishness. Almost every weekend they vibrate my windows with their huge music box while their battalion of children back-ball and juk the floor, the wall and each other. Sigh. I’m trying hard to mind my own business.

Just before the rain started this morning, I helped my mom wash. We used blue-soap, hard-brush and scrubbing-board. These days I look forward to washing with mom. I’ve seen her age these last few years and it forced me to accept that my time with her is not endless. Time is not endless for us.

I wait up for my brother at nights now and we do dumb things or watch pointless TV. I’m watching him become a man and I know that I won’t always be around to witness his life first hand. There’s no telling where life will take us. My mother’s eldest sister has lived in another country for most of their lives and they haven’t seen each other in years. One day, distance may stretch between my brother and I and we’ll fill that space with memories and Skype and annual visits.

This is also the first time in more than 15 years that I haven’t lived with Nani. She is there in her house and I am here in mine. Sometimes, it feels as if our worlds are not the same and never were and never could be but every now and then we meet and we laugh. Laughing makes everything better.

Life will never be perfect and happiness is not constant. But who wants that? Seriously, perfect and constant are predictable and boring.

Facial Implants. Bergen Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery in Hackensack, Westwood, Ridgewood NJ. Facial implants are used to enhance certain features of your face, including your cheeks or your jaw line. The surgery may be elective, or part of the reconstruction of the face due to an accident or illness, or needed as the result of prior surgery on the face. Through a facial implant, a maxillofacial surgeon can aesthetically improve facial contours.. Depending on your medical history and your overall objectives of this surgery — our doctors can recommend several courses of action. Surgery can be done with local anesthesia with an oral sedative to help you relax or general anesthesia which means you’ll be put to sleep. The length of surgery will depend on which part of your face is affected, but it commonly lasts between one to two hours. You may want to consider lower jaw, cheek or chin implants.. -.

(Reuters) - Hudbay Minerals on Tuesday vowed to appeal a court ruling that barred the Canadian miner from building a major copper mine in the United States after losing its bid to have a judge revisit the decision.

U.S. District Judge James Soto late on Monday said there was no basis to reconsider an earlier ruling that overturned approvals for the company’s contentious Rosemont project in southeastern Arizona, delivering a setback for Hudbay as it seeks to revive plans for the stalled $1.9 billion open-pit mine.

Hudbay’s director of investor relations, Candace Brule, said the company was disappointed with the decision and would proceed with an appeal as it studies next steps for the project.

“This ruling confirms that the court continues to misinterpret decades of precedent and the federal regulations and mining laws that govern the Rosemont project,” she said.

At issue is the validity of mining claims that would allow the company to dispose of mine waste on public lands adjacent to its operations.

The U.S. District Court for Arizona in July overturned approvals issued by the U.S. Forest Service for the mine, siding with environmental and tribal groups opposed to the plan.

Hudbay in August said it would appeal that ruling but it first asked the court to reconsider the decision on grounds it overstepped its authority.

However, Soto said there was no basis to reopen the case, according to a copy of the decision seen by Reuters. “Mere disagreement with a previous order is an insufficient basis for reconsideration,” the judge wrote.

Hudbay had planned to start construction of Rosemont by the end of this year, with first production expected by the end of 2022.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto says Texas' decision to deploy National Guard troops along the border is "unpleasant" and "reprehensible."

Last month's deployment had previously drawn Mexico's ire. It says the border should not be militarized and issues should be solved jointly.

In an interview with the newspaper El Universal published Friday, Pena Nieto said Texas' move could affect bilateral relations.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry has criticized border security and suggested last month that Islamic terrorists could be entering the U.S. from Mexico, a charge Mexico has dismissed as "absurd."

Texas says it needs to deploy National Guard troops to stop drug traffickers. The number of Central American migrants entering Texas also spiked earlier this year, but the flow has since declined.

NEWS. September 2013 High-Efficiency Ducted Steerprop Azimuth Propulsors for three vessels to be built in China. High-Efficiency Ducted Steerprop Azimuth Propulsors for three vessels to be built in China.. In late August and early September 2013, Steerprop Ltd. signed contracts with Chinese customers to deliver main propulsion azimuth propulsors for three offshore support vessels due to be built in China in 2014. All three vessels will be equipped with two 2000 kW SP 25 D Ducted Azimuth Propulsors. The propulsors will be delivered in mid-2014.. All of these propulsors will be equipped with the Steerprop HJ3 high efficiency nozzle. These high efficiency nozzles are hydrodynamically optimized to improve bollard pull without compromising free running efficiency. This combination of thrust and efficiency is sometimes very important in vessels that require both high bollard pull and efficiency such as Platform Support Vessels or other Offshore Support Vessels.

Q:

How do I find out which processes are causing the most disk activity?

I am hoping to find a way to do more performance monitoring--specifically, I hope that monitoring disk activity on a per-process basis will help me decide which programs are causing the most trouble (aside from the AV).   I'd rather avoid a shotgun approach.
For windows XP, is there a process monitor that can give me a solid idea of which processes are slowing me down by causing the most page faults, etc?  Thanks!

A:

Perhaps enabling the I/O reads and writes in the task manager (ctrl+shift+esc).  When looking at the processes in task manager select View then Select Columns.  Look for the I/O read optiona nd I/O write option and click them.  
This is what I get:

A:

While I prefer the accepted answer, there is another way with the existing task manager.

Task manager > Performance (tab) > Resource Monitor (button) > Disk (tab)

A:

I like the freeware Process Explorer.  It provides a bit more detail than the Windows Task Manager, including per-process I/O graphs.  Great for immediately spotting processes doing a lot of disk I/O.

Efficient infection from cDNA clones of cucumber mosaic cucumovirus RNAs in a new plasmid vector.
Full-length cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV) cDNAs were cloned into a new plasmid vector containing a modified plant virus promoter designed to transcribe the inserted sequence from its first nucleotide. cDNA copies of CMV strain Q (Q-CMV) genomic RNAs 1, 2 and 3 cloned into this vector were infectious when inoculated together, producing symptoms indistinguishable from those caused by wildtype Q-CMV infection. The infectivity of the clones could be substantially increased by excision of the viral insert together with the transcriptional promoter and terminator prior to inoculation. A diagnostic but silent mutation was introduced into the RNA 2 cDNA and found to be stably maintained in viral infection, allowing distinction of the recombinant virus from native contaminants. The infectious cDNA clones supported the replication of CMV satellite RNA when co-inoculated with biologically active Q-CMV satellite RNA transcripts. Using the infectious cDNAs described, it was found that a newly-identified overlapping gene (2b) encoded by Q-CMV RNA 2 was not essential for either systemic viral infection of Nicotiana glutinosa or replication of the satellite RNAs.

Jennifer Hinton at the Guardian:. The issue of austerity versus stimulus is often framed as the entire debate – if you don’t support one, you must support the other, because there are no alternatives. This is the same binary debate that has been going on for more than 100 years between the state versus the market. Yet, these dichotomies distract people from thinking about what’s really important – the goal of these policies, which is to grow the economy.. No analysis I’ve read thus far has questioned the damaging role that the endless quest for economic growth plays. Neither austerity nor government stimulus will ever be able to address the debt crises and recessions of the twenty-first century because what we’re dealing with here is an inherent contradiction of capitalism.

Q:

Was Michael Fassbender actually under the head for most of the movie?

In Frank (2014), the titular character Frank wears a big fake head for most of the movie. Is it Michael Fassbender who's under that head most of the movie? Or did he just act in the scenes in the last 15 min of the movie?

A:

I follow Jon Ronson (the writer of "Frank") on Twitter, and he has answered that question a few times, reporting that Fassbender did wear the mask all the time. There is a Q&A with the cast of the movie on the Collider website, and Michael Fassbender gives more details.

FASSBENDER: Yeah, I found it really liberating.  The only thing that
it took a bit of getting used to – or never really getting used to –
was when we were doing the performances, the sound in there.  You
know, I would go away and I was learning an accent and I’m practicing
it like this and then once you put the head on, there’s a reverb thing
that’s going on in there and it kind of puts the hearing off a little
bit, and it’s hard to sort of locate some stuff, but that was it.
The
rest was a lot of fun.  It was really cool.  It was like, as soon as I
put the head on it gave me an element of mischief.  It gives it sort
of the anarchic quality of Chris Sievey’s original Frank Sidebottom
character.  I think [he] really sort of came out in that.
And also,
it’s exactly what Lenny was saying.  For the other actors, it never
mattered that I couldn’t make eye contact really with other actors
because Frank is Frank and Frank lives in his own universe, and so I
was hoping for them, it would be the same.  Is he listening?  Is he
not listening?  Did he hear that?  They’re used to him anyway.  Except
for Domhnall’s character, which is a new introduction, everybody’s
used to Frank with the head on.  ‘Oh, that’s just Frank doing his
thing,’ or whatever it is.  Whether I was engaged or not engaged, both
times I think it was a help for me and hopefully for the other guys
that were responding to him.

And later, from the same interview:

FASSBENDER: It was hot and sweaty in there sometimes.  If you’re
running around in there, you can’t breathe as easy as you would
without it, but like I say, I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed having the head
on.  I actually wanted to bring it on to my next job.  They wouldn’t
let me.  [Laughs]

Although, they did have a second head for the stuntman. The only time Fassbender wasn't wearing it.

GLEESON: There’s another one for the stuntman that had little bits cut
out.  The one time it’s not Michael is when the guy gets knocked over
by the car.

This is why I find LORAC’s new $28 Ready, Set, Splash kit appealing…

That, and the quick-drying, waterproof formula.

The set’s four twist-up pencils come in colors that work well with most of my favorite summer eye looks.

Ultra Black, Navy, Charcoal and Jade will take you from poolside to dinner party in the blink of a cat eye, and when I want a smudgy vibe, I can just flip one over, and use the sponge tip on the back side.

From the left: Ultra Black, Charcoal, Jade and Navy

All of them are waterproof along the lash line. I just have to remember to keep my hands away from my eyes — no rubbing! Otherwise they start to disappear.

When I use these, I always try to remember to use short strokes, because they’re a little on the hard side. If I’m not careful, they’ll skip and look uneven.

If you’re hoping to wear these along your water line, you might want to pause (or as Tabs says, “paws”) first. I need from 3-4 layers to get the formula to really stick there, giving it about a minute between layers to dry.

Best for: Matte finish eye liner fans with a hankerin’ for a waterproof pencil to wear along their lash lines. And glide, these don’t, so you probably should be okay with harder textures.

Wow, love the colors! And like you said, I do love the look of the double color wing. All set to go and buy ’em, and then I noticed you said they “do not glide”, boo hop, I guess I’ll pass on these pretties after all.Allison recently posted … Guerlain Le Top Coat Gel: Manicure Savior?

6 Ways Monthly Meal Planning Can Save Money!

Have you tried Monthly Meal Planning? It can save you time, money, and your sanity, for real!

It’s the fifteen minute countdown for you to come up with an answer before you are sure to hear: “Mom! What’s for dinner?”

But, you haven’t had time to even think about dinner, much less plan for it and you know if you don’t come up with something fast – you’re going to be consumed by hungry little monsters… well, you know what I mean! lol

The next thing that pops in your mind… and theirs? Fast food… it’s just easier and faster, everyone will be happy and you won’t have to wash dishes after. But, stop and think: now you’re about to spend FOUR TIMES what it would have cost you to make a meal at home.

Let’s talk about how to fix this problem, save you money, and lower the stress of dinnertime.

Once you learn how to effectively meal plan you will become completely infatuated with MONTHLY meal planning! Weekly planning is great, but. monthly planning takes your stress levels down to an all time low! One more thing off your plate (no pun intended) means more time for other important things in your life.

Don’t be overwhelmed by the thought of becoming a monthly family meal planner! Even if you’re a weekly meal planner, all you’ll need is a couple hours, one day a month, to plan for the next month. Get out your planner, favorite recipes, and of course Pinterest, and start making your menu and grocery list.

You can also save a good amount of money with weekly planning. Once you give monthly planning a try you’ll be shocked that you can actually lower your grocery budget by as much as 50% and more!

Let’s look at these 6 ways monthly meal planning will save you even more money:

Skip The Drive Through

The very first thing monthly planning is going to eliminate is the urge to hit the drive through. Since you already know what you will be making for dinner each night, you already have the ingredients ready to go, it really is a no brainer!

Every time you buy fast food you’re spending about four times the cost of making your meal at home. That certainly adds up!

No Last Minute Store Runs

How many times have you been halfway through preparing dinner and realize that you are missing a key ingredient? Quickly you try to scramble up the kids (who are already hungry remember?) and make a run to the grocery store.

Not only is this super stressful, chances are you are not going to strictly buy that one ingredient you needed in the first place. It’s a little scary how the costs of a few extra items each time you are at the store add up. Monthly meal planning is going to drastically reduce the number of times you go to the store each month and as a result minimize this extra spending saving you even MORE.

Save That Gas

It’s simple. The less you have to drive your car the less gas you will use and the less money you will need to spend on gas. Once you start monthly meal planning you can save as much as over $100 each month on gas!

Making less last minute trips to the store and doing one large shopping trip at the beginning of the month are both ways you are going to save money on gas.

No Waste

You know what I mean, that moldy old produce in the back of the fridge. It’s enough to make you sick (in more ways than one) when you have to throw out food. That’s just like throwing money in the trash.

When you monthly meal plan there isn’t going to be any moldy veggies hiding in the crisper since you will only be buying exactly what you need. No more impulse buying because you think that you need an extra head of lettuce because maybe you will use it for a meal this week. No more throwing your money away!

No More Dinnertime Stress

Are you a stressful spender? You might not even realize it yet but you might be. When the last minute dinner stress sets in, you are bound to spend more money than necessary.

You will be amazed at how getting an entire month of meal planning out of the way is going to lower your stress levels and more than just at dinnertime! You will be freeing up more time in your week, and as a result you will have more time to think about all the other things that need your attention. You’ll be spending less money on groceries and gas meaning less stress paying the bills because you’ll have more to apply elsewhere. Monthly meal planning equals less stress!

Glasgow

This Scottish city is big on space and full of creativity.

Perched on the River Clyde is Scotland’s biggest city. Glasgow is actually the third largest city in the UK, with a population of 600,000 people. Here you’re walking through one of the Industrial Revolution’s pivotal districts. With a rich history in engineering, textiles and shipbuilding still evident wherever you wander.

Today, Glasgow is also famous for its arts and culture scene. With the School of Art, Zaha Hadid’s award-winning Riverside Museum, and Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum all making waves. Visitors also flock to Hampden Park for a taste of football history.

And with plenty of space and a curious population, it’s no surprise Glasgow has the nation’s second highest retail spend after London.

Scaramouche opened its doors on February 28, 2009 with the group exhibition, "The Practice of Joy Before Death; It just would not be a party without you" which brought together an eclectic and exciting group of artists living and working in the New York area.. The gallery is dedicated to the bold and enlightening journeys of both the emerging and established artist. Working in a variety of media, from the traditional to the more unusual and innovative, these artists explore contemporary reality through site-specific installation, with particular emphasis on conceptual and identity-based painting, photography, video and performance work.. It is Scaramouche’s mission to introduce artists from around the globe, often premiering their first U.S. solo exhibitions. In addition to showing the work of gallery artists, Scaramouche regularly produces group exhibitions comprised of diverse artists representing a broad range of work.

For as long as I can remember, sport, athletics and fitness have been an integral part of my life. From competing in track and field and soccer at an early age in Trinidad, and then moving onto baseball when I moved to Canada. In high school I joined the football and rugby teams,I remember and to this day still love the feeling that comes with competing. The validation of the practice, and hours alone spent training. The camaraderie amongst you and your teammates after a tough win, and tough losses. People often say that sports are a great tool for teaching life lessons. In my case they were a tool that i used to develop confidence, self awareness, and build life long friendships. It also taught me discipline, commitment, and accountability.

I really didn’t feel like doing this today. I’m in a bad mood for a fucking good reason. Hope everything sorts out.. But. It is the last day of March so here it fucking goes.. I’ve wanted this type of shorts/skirt dark blue with dots (stars) since last year, and I finally found it. Second-hand. I paid 25 kunas for it (4,50 $) but it is to big so I will have to do a little re-do with a sewing machine. No problem.. The shirt is sleeveless and I loooove the material. That was less than a dollar in a sale in textile house.. Sorry for all the “fuckings”, I can’t be in a good mood all the time.. Sometimes only the F-word will do 🙂. Hopefully you will have days ahead where the F-word will turn into an H-word (whatever is a “happy” word for you) 🙂

Duct Tape - a Doom 3 mod

Under the crazy presumption that a roll of duct tape has to exist somewhere on the Mars facility, the Duct Tape mod sticks flashlights to your machinegun and shotgun. In order to preserve the atmosphere, these new lights are much narrower (and a little brighter) than the standard flashlight, and are only available on the basic weapons. The pistol is not equipped with a flashlight, so as not to spoil the early sections of the game.

Download

A readme.txt within the archive contains installation instructions. Note that the file now contains files for both Doom3 1.3 and Doom3: Resurrection of Evil. For Doom3 1.3, copy the pak008.pk4 file into your /base folder, for Resurrection of Evil, copy the pak002.pk4 file into the appropriate folder (no idea what it's called as I don't have it). Be careful not to overwrite your existing /base/pak002.pk4 folder.

Misc/FAQ

Duct Tape was downloaded over 80,000 times in the first 24 hours of its release (not including downloads from the mirrors at various mod sites).

A toggle to turn the light on and off is coming. Perhaps.

The smaller cone is intentional (see above); if you want it as large as the flashlight, either use Duct Tape 0001 or replace lights/flashlight6.tga in pak005.pk4 with lights/flashlight5.tga from pak001.pk4

Not adding the flashlight to all the weapons is also intentional (see above).

The Doom3 SDK is not available - all you need to create mods like this is in the .pk4 files (use an unzip utility on them).

It's a mod - that it changes the game to something not intended by id is a given. Most find the game more fun using it, you may not.

Q:

Do NSArrays stay sorted when saved then retrieved from a plist

Simple question do NSArrays stay sorted when saved to a plist and then retrieved? 
I am having a sorting issue when i retrieve my array from my plist so i was curious.
I think it may also be a problem with this line. Do these maintain the order from titles followed the order of titleArr?
NSMutableArray *allTitles = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
[allTitles addObjectsFromArray:titles];
[allTitles addObjectsFromArray:titleArr];

How I save to plist
imageInfo = [[NSMutableArray array] init];

    NSMutableArray *Listing = [NSMutableArray array];
    [imageInfo addObject:Listing];

    NSDictionary *Images = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                            allTitles, kKeyTitle,
                            allMediaUrls, kKeyThumbUrl,
                            allWidths, kKeyThumbWidth,
                            allHeights, kKeyThumbHeight,
                            nil];
    [Listing addObject:Images];

    NSArray *sysPaths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory ,NSUserDomainMask, YES);

    NSString *documentsDirectory = [sysPaths objectAtIndex:0];

    NSString *filePath = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"image.plist"];

    NSLog(@"Plist File Path: %@", filePath);

    BOOL didWriteToFile = [imageInfo writeToFile:filePath atomically:YES];

    if (didWriteToFile) {
        NSLog(@"Write to .plist file is a SUCCESS!");
    } else {
        NSLog(@"Write to .plist file is a FAILURE!");
    }

A:

Yes if titles and titleArr are sorted than allTitles  will also be sorted. 
First all objects of titles will be added and than at all objects titleArr will be added as addObjectsFromArray method starts adding object array towards the end of receiving array.
Here is more info from Apple Docs

Adds the objects contained in another given array to the end of the
  receiving array’s content.

So yes plist  will have sorted array.

If you get a server of your own, it will work independently, so it will have its own Os and you could later install server side apps directly or script-driven sites via a hosting Control Panel. While keeping the Operating System updated is not always considered an absolute necessity, it can be a rather important task for a variety of reasons. A more modern OS version may have better support for certain hardware, so you could get better performance for the internet sites and web apps you install. Your server shall also be more secure since updates normally include security patches that resolve small problems which may enable unauthorized people to access your content. Last, but not least, more modern script versions, which are also released for both enhanced security and for additional features, may require a later version of the Os in order to work correctly and with their full capabilities.

Blazers. Blazers. The Blazers is one of the most versatile and wearable garments in a man’s wardrobe.

Justification of exclusion criteria was underreported in a review of cardiovascular trials.
Ethical guidelines for human subject research require that the burdens and benefits of participation be equally distributed. This study aimed to provide empirical data on exclusion of trial participants and reasons for this exclusion. As a secondary objective, we assessed to what extent exclusion affects generalizability of study results. Review of trials on secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. One hundred thirteen trials were identified, of which 112 reported exclusion criteria. One study justified the exclusion criteria applied. Ambiguous exclusion criteria due to the opinion of the physician (28 of 112 = 25%) or physical disability (12 of 112 = 11%) were reported. Within groups of trials that studied similar treatments (ie, beta-blocker, clopidogrel, or statin therapy), baseline characteristics differed among trials. For example, the proportion of women ranged between 23.1-47.4%, 2.1-38.9%, and 10.6-50.6% for the clopidogrel, beta-blocker, and statin trials, respectively. Nevertheless, no evidence was found for heterogeneity of treatment effects. Almost none of the articles justified the applied exclusion criteria. No evidence was found that inclusion of dissimilar participants affected generalizability. To allow for a normative discussion on equitable selection of study populations, researchers should not only report exclusion criteria but also the reasons for using these criteria.

Q:

Removing emails from all mailboxes with certain text in subject

So, we had an errant program kick off about 15,000 emails to our users.  I have our spam filters now blocking these on the edge until that gets resolved, but now I would like to clean our our users' mailboxes for them.  Is there anyway with Exchange 2007 to remove all emails with certain text in the subject line?  It would need to be a partial match because the subject changes slightly for each email.
I am trying to do this with Forefront's manual scan job + content filter, but it does not seem to like partial matches on the subject.

I haven't used it myself, but the export-mailbox PowerShell command should be what you need using the -Deletecontent option along with the -SubjectKeywords option.  Here's the link from MSDN on export-mailbox.  I also found this blog post with some good information.

The present invention relates to a handheld spraying device adapted for at-home kitchen use and, more particularly, to such a device employing a quick disconnect feature that allows the user to replace the spraying mechanism with mechanisms of different shapes, sizes and spraying features without having to replace the connecting hose assembly.
Handheld spraying devices are becoming increasingly popular for in-home kitchen use for a variety of applications ranging from dishwashing to the spraying of vegetables. For different applications, different nozzle sizes and shapes and spraying patterns are preferred. While a variety of quick disconnect mechanisms have heretofore been developed to permit quick and easy disassembly of a spray nozzle for cleaning or replacement, such mechanisms are often relatively complicated and thus are relatively expensive to manufacture and difficult to use and/or require the use of separate tools. As a result, such devices have not met with widespread acceptance. It would be highly desirable if a disconnect assembly could  be incorporated into a handheld spraying device that was of simple construction, inexpensive to manufacture and could be easily utilized to change the spraying mechanism without having to replace the connecting hose assembly and without the need for tools or complicated multi-step procedures to provide a plurality of spray features for different applications. The present invention provides such an assembly.

Intermountain Healthcare Teams with GE Healthcare in Effort to Reduce Patients' CT Radiation Dose by up to 50 Percent

Salt Lake City–Intermountain Healthcare today announced a joint effort with GE Healthcare to help further reduce radiation dose in Computed Tomography (CT) procedures at its facilities by up to 50 percent*. Intermountain and GE Healthcare will collaborate to further reduce patients' radiation dose through the GE Blueprint for low dose, a comprehensive solution combining technology, people and processes. The GE Blueprint program will include a special focus on reducing radiation during pediatric imaging procedures, and was announced today at Intermountain's Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City.

CT imaging is a critical tool in helping physicians diagnose disease and has positively impacted millions of adults and children. Through collaboration with GE Healthcare and implementation of innovative imaging technologies and system-specific solutions, Intermountain will continue to lead in further reducing radiation dose while maintaining exceptional image quality in diagnostic procedures. The program will include a focus on the unique needs of pediatric patients, leveraging technologies and protocols to help doctors match body size and type to appropriate scans.

"Ensuring high quality images at the lowest possible radiation dose is a priority in every diagnostic imaging procedure at Intermountain, including an emphasis on the specific needs of children in our care," said Dr. Keith White, medical director of Imaging Services for Intermountain Healthcare. "Through our work with GE Healthcare, we continue to invest in the very latest solutions to optimize imaging, delivering the highest standards of care to all patients."

"GE Healthcare has long been committed to working with health care providers, including the nation's leading hospitals, to help them continuously reduce radiation dose in CT imaging," said Steve Gray, vice president and general manager of CT & Advantage Workstation for GE Healthcare. "We look forward to collaborating with clinical leaders at Intermountain Healthcare and building upon GE's announcement last year of more than $800 million of investment in low-dose technologies over 15 years."

Traditionally in CT, high-image quality often required greater patient exposure to diagnostic radiation, and conversely, lower dose levels for the patient usually meant lower image clarity. Over the last four decades, CT technology and processes have evolved. Together with GE Healthcare, Intermountain is helping change the equation by continuing to lower radiation dose while maintaining diagnostic image quality - in adult as well as pediatric imaging.

* GE Blueprint's goal is to work with healthcare providers to reduce their average patient exposure by up to 50 percent, based on longitudinal tracking of average dose. The dose reduction goal is the result of a comprehensive program covering a full array of dose reduction principles. It is not solely based on equipment features. Individual site achievement will vary and any percentage reduction is dependent on the initial baseline for that site. In all cases diagnostic image quality must be maintained.

Q:

Bash beginner: Edit value and add new values

I have a group of files (of varying line number) that always finish like this
[ molecules ]
; Compound        #mols
Protein_chain_A     1
SOL             12161

What I'd like to do using bash is subtract 2 from the value for SOL and add a new line like so within the file (the ideal would be with two tabs between the SOL and CL and their respective values)
SOL       12159
CL        2

I've tried bits and pieces with awk and sed but it keeps bugging on me. Would it be best to just use something else like Python?

A:

I would use the language I know the best (Perl in my case). But bash and its tools can serve you well, too:
{
    head -n-1 "$file"
    read sol num < <(tail -n1 "$file")
    echo $sol$'\t'$((num-2))
    echo CL$'\t'2
} > "$file".new

TEMECULA: City wrapping up review of wireless antenna plan

The city is getting ready to wrap up what has turned into a
monthslong review of Houston-based
Crown Castle
International's
plan to install a huge wireless antenna system
across a wide swath of Temecula.

Since March, the city Planning Commission has approved 35 of the
39 antennas that will make up the system, which initially will be
used by
MetroPCS
to enhance
its local coverage.

Many of the antennas, which are nodes in a grid that covers the
majority of the city's southern and eastern reaches, are light
poles with antennas attached to the side.

In areas where city residents didn't want extra light, they will
just be poles with antennas that look like stereo speakers attached
to the sides.

Stuart Fisk, city senior planner, said Friday that Crown Castle
is working with residents on placing the final four nodes and he
expects that the commission could consider the last batch in
November.

Illustrating the challenges Crown Castle has faced as it has
worked to find places for its nodes, Fisk said a resident who lives
near Crowne Hill Drive asked for a pole that had been approved to
be moved away from her home, to
Crowne Hill and Pauba Road.

The commission was set to look at that new location this week,
but the item was postponed because residents who live near the
corner were concerned about the antenna.

So it's back to the drawing board for Crown Castle, a company
that last year bought New Path Networks Inc. to boost its wireless
infrastructure business.

Fisk said some of the other issues to be worked out are
relatively minor. Crown Castle is working to secure permission to
use an existing wood utility pole in one location instead of
installing a new metal pole, and it is looking at moving a pole
near the clubhouse in the
Paseo
del Sol neighborhood.

As the commission has reviewed each of the nodes in the past few
months, it has heard from residents worried about radiation that
will be emitted from the devices.

The commission, however, cannot consider those types of concerns
when approving or denying the application because of federal law.
It can only rule on narrow issues such as aesthetics.

Other residents have asked why the city needs more wireless
coverage, especially in neighborhoods already wired by large
carriers.

Patrick Richardson, director of planning and redevelopment, has
responded by saying the city has to treat Crown Castle as a
utility, and utilities are allowed to use the public right of way
---- in this case, sidewalks and the like ---- to install
infrastructure for the public good.

As for how the city would handle applications by other companies
looking to follow in Crown Castle's path, Assistant City Attorney
Bill Curley said that the city would ask future companies to work
with existing infrastructure rather than build new poles.

Along those lines, Crown Castle reps have said that the system
will be able to handle additional carriers in the future, such as
AT&T, Verizon and Sprint.

Ceramide stimulates prostaglandin production by human amnion and decidual cells.
To determine whether ceramide regulates prostaglandin (PG) production by cultured human amnion cells and decidual cells independently of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Cells were grown in monolayer culture and then incubated with varying concentrations of ceramide, IL-1 beta, ceramide in the presence and absence of IL-1, and control media. Production of PGE2 was determined using a specific radioimmunoassay. Ceramide induced a significant concentration-dependent increase in PGE2 production by amnion cells and decidual cells. However, PGE2 production induced by IL-1 beta was significantly more than with ceramide alone, and there was no potentiation of PGE2 production with coincubation of ceramide and IL-1 beta. We suggest that term human amnion cells and decidual cells are responsive to ceramide independent of IL-1 beta and that generation of these substances in response to an infection in the uterus may lead to increased PG production by human gestational tissues, indicating that there are several mechanisms leading to PG production by these cells.

[Anti-tetanus vaccination after 3 cases of tetanus in a basic rural health area].
a) To find the prevalence of anti-tetanus vaccination in a health district, and b) to detect difficulties in the implementation of corrective measures, after the appearance of three cases of tetanus in 6 months. An observational descriptive crossover study. Primary care. Rural health district with 18266 inhabitants. People of both sexes over 14 from the 3 population nuclei, which had the best records of attendance and vaccination in the health district. Vaccination coverage at the start and end of the intervention for 328 people chosen by systematic randomised sampling. clinical records. At the start of the intervention there was less vaccination coverage among males, over-50s and people living in small nuclei of population. During the study period vaccination coverage increased more in the nuclei where there had been a tetanus case. Vaccines were lacking at the start of the intervention. A low use of clinical records in the health district was detected, which posed difficulties for the research. Except for one of the population nuclei, very few people at the start of the study were recorded as correctly vaccinated. It is seen that the health service responded slowly to such serious cases as these. It is suggested that primary health care activities should be programmed more in accord with the health problems prevailing in each area. With an illness like tetanus we should not wait for a case to occur before acting.

[Mycobacterium kansasii infection after liver transplantation].
Infections are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients because of treatment with immunosuppressive agents. Infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are infrequent but may be a major cause of morbidity. Treatment is associated with therapeutic limitations due to drug interactions with immunosuppressive agents and enhanced toxicity. Treatment of NTM infection most commonly involves surgery, reducing the doses of immunosuppressive medications and/or therapy with antimycobacterial medications The American Thoracic Society recommends isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol. The current duration for treatment of pulmonary disease caused by Mycobacterium kansasii is 18 months. We describe the case of an immunosuppressed liver transplant recipient with poor outcome due to acute cholangitis who also developed concomitant infection with an uncommon organism, M. kansasii, in the late posttransplantation period.

The survival of foot-and-mouth disease virus in raw and pasteurized milk and milk products.
The Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus (FMDV) is not a public health threat, but it is highly contagious to cloven-footed animals. The virus is shed into milk up to 33 h before there are apparent signs of the disease in dairy cows, and, in extreme cases, signs of disease may not appear for up to 14 d. During this time, raw milk can serve as a vector for spread of the disease both at the farm and during transport to the processing plant by milk tanker. Raw milk and milk products fed to animals have the potential to cause infection, but the potential for pasteurized milk products to cause infection is largely unknown. Current minimum pasteurization standards may not be adequate to eliminate FMDV in milk completely. The purpose of this paper is to assess the literature on the thermal resistance of FMDV in milk and milk products, to identify the risks associated with ingestion of pasteurized products by animals, and to lay a strategy to prevent the spread of FMDV from contaminated milk.

Hyundai says it will set a new standard for the lower end of the electric-vehicle market with its line of Ioniq EVs. The automaker says it will also launch an all-electric EV with a 200-mile range by 2018 and within two years of that will sell an EV with a range of 250 miles. The 2016 Hyundai Sonata PHEV plug-in hybrid is the brand’s first model to run on battery power alone, but the company promises much more to come. Hyundai has already said its Ioniq hybrid model would top the current industry leader, the Toyota Prius, in terms of efficiency. The Ioniq will be offered in three versions: a gas-electric hybrid; battery electric; and a plug-in hybrid.. Hyundai says that the new Ioniq (pictured) is just the beginning of electrification for the company. Next up is an entry-level battery electric with a 200-mile range, not unlike the current Chevrolet Bolt. (PHOTO: HYUNDAI)

Q:

Are expectation of with replacement and without replacement same? When?

I have $k_1$ red balls and $k_2$ green balls in a box. These balls are select by a uniform distribution. Randomly select $n$ balls from the box. Let $X$ be random variable that counts number of red ball after $n$ trails. What is expected number of red ball after $n$ trails if

These balls are uniform randomly select with replacement
These balls are uniform randomly select without replacement

Are these expectation similar? When?
This is what I did:
For with replacement case, I followed the answer at What is the probability that selects $i$ red ball and $n-i$ green ball, with replacement? and got the result as
$$E_1(X)=n \frac{k_1}{k_1+k_2}$$
In case of without replacement, I follow the Hypergeometric distribution 
$$E_2(X)=\sum_i^{k_1}  \frac{\binom{k_1}{i}\binom{k_2}{n-i}}{\binom{k_1+k_2}{n}} i$$
Thanks all 
This is MATLAB simulation for two cases. I saw that these expectation are same. Why?.
k1=8;k2=8;n=13;
%% With replacement
sum_E1=n*k1/(k1+k2);
%% Without replacement
sum_E2=0;
for i=0:k1
    if ((n-i>k2)|(n-i<0))
        continue;
    else
        sum_E2=sum_E2+i*nchoosek(k1,i)*nchoosek(k2,n-i)./nchoosek(k1+k2,n);
    end
end
sum_E1
sum_E2

A:

Actually, no, it is not a uniform distribution. I hope you found out that in case 1, $X$ follows a binomial distribution with $n$ trials, and $p = k_1/(k_1+k_2)$. You should be familiar with the fact that
$$E[X] = np.$$
Further, you seem to be familiar with the fact that in case 2, $X$ follows a hypergeometric distribution with $n$ trials, $N = k_1+k_2$ total balls, and $G = k_1$ red balls. You should be familiar with the fact that
$$E[X] = n\cdot \frac{G}{N}.$$
Notice that $n\cdot G/N = n\cdot k_1/(k_1+k_2) = np$. The most you can draw in case 2 are $k_1+k_2$ balls, so the two will be the same when $0\leq n\leq k_1+k_2$. Also, I assume that "These balls are select by a uniform distribution." means that you draw the balls fairly/impartially from the box, not that there is some underlying uniform distribution that is not revealed.

Or Kachlon could be the latest Israeli to attend the renowned Juilliard School of dance, drama and music in New York. The winner of last month's Born to Dance reality television series can now be found overseas auditioning for a spot in the school's Dance Division. The auditions in New York began on March 3 and ended yesterday. Among the Dance Division's alumni are the celebrated choreographers and dance company directors Lar Lubovitch, Paul Taylor, Bruce Marks, Susan Marshall, and Martha Clarke. While Kachlon found fame through his participation in the Channel 2 TV show, he made it known that his choosing to be a dancer was not easy socially. In Hadera, kids in his class called him the "gay nerd". The handsome 18-year-old was a favorite from day one of the contest. Although other reality TV winners, especially those from Born to Sing, have gone on to be local celebrities, Kachlon made it clear that he just wants to dance. In the coming days, we should know if Kachlon is headed to the top of the dance world.

Precious metals investment terms A to Z

CBOT (Chicago Board of Trade)

Chicago Board of Trade, established in 1848, is a commodity exchange and a designated contract market that offers traditional commodity and other financial instruments to traders, subject to the exchange rules and regulations.

In 2005, CBOT transformed from a non-profit organization to a for-profit organization with an IPO on the NYSE, listed as CBOT Holdings Inc. (Ticker: BOT). In 2007, the exchange merged with Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to form the CME Group. Now CBOT, along with CME, NYMEX and COMEX, operates as a designated contract market (DCM) of the CME Group.

Although the exchange dealt with only agricultural commodities in the initial days of establishment, now it offers options and futures contract on precious metals, energy and even U.S. Treasury bonds. The exchange was an open auction market for decades; however, it has added electronic futures trading facility in recent years. Enormous market volume in commodity related contracts ranks CBOT as one of the top exchanges in commodity space.

In the Salento countryside, shaped for centuries by olive trees, members of the Farmers’ Cooperative Agricola Nuova Generazione extract only the best parts from the olives using increasingly modern tools and methods that nonetheless respect past traditions. The experience of those who manage the various processing phases guarantees the quality of the products, which reach the market directly by means of leading transport companies without passing through intermediaries, which sometimes alters the products’ characteristics. In 2006, the Cooperative opened a factory for processing table olives, thus increasing the range of their product offerings. The farmers’ cooperative, established in Martano in 1979 by a group of 20 young farmers, currently comprises 1400 members to whom it tries to offer maximum profitability from the work and maximum productivity from the land with permanent employment in agriculture. In February 2010 the Cooperative carried out a merger and incorporated two other cooperatives, the Cooperativo di Corigliano D’Otranto oil mill and the Cantina Campi Latini di Seclì, thus expanding their product offerings with wines and becoming a food farming reference point for the Salento area. If you visit the farm from October to January, you can participate in the olive harvesting and pressing and you can take home the oil you make.

I’ve been extremely curious about Sweetpea & Fay’s J’Adore Les Levres liquid lipsticks for a while now–well over a year, actually–but I didn’t decided to order from them until this past Black Friday. I was initially intrigued by their sizeable line of colors, including unusual ones like blue and yellow. They usually sell for $9.99, but with the Black Friday sale I paid $5.99 for each. I ordered three colors:

Nordic, described on the site as “an opaque greyish blue matte shade”

Ukulele, described on the site as “a pastel pink/purple shade with a completely opaque look”

and Nantes, described on the site as “a stunning dark rose color with maroon undertones”

My natural lips:

Nordic:

Ukulele:

Nantes:

Arm swatches (Nantes, Ukulele, Nordic from top to bottom):

(All photos were taken in natural light with no editing.)

After swatching all of the colors on my lips, I feel like all of the descriptions are pretty accurate*. I do think that the site describing some of the shades as “opaque” is somewhat redundant, as all of the colors appear to be designed as opaque shades, but I can understand why they would want to restate it in lighter colors where natural lip color might show through. The lipsticks are very opaque and thick; while they are described as “liquid”, they wear more like a cream lipstick. The texture is very soft and doesn’t feel drying at all. Their staying power seems to be about the same as other lipsticks of similar textures: they’ll last a few hours if you’re not eating, but won’t hold up too well against greasier foods (I tested this with Trader Joe’s Mac n’ Cheese, which is delicious but not very lipstick-friendly). They are described as having “a soft french vanilla flavor,” which I find to be true, although they do still have a slight cosmetic scent underneath–they smell pleasant, but you can tell it’s a lipstick.

You really need to use a lip brush to apply these; if you try to apply straight from the tube, it would be very messy. Luckily, a lip brush is included in every order. You simply squeeze some product onto the brush, then begin in the center of the lower lip and spread outwards. I find these easy to work, particularly when compared to other liquid lipsticks, due to the more solid nature of the product. However, they do take more time than a traditional lipstick; each swatch took me about five minutes to get right.

Final verdict: 8/10 stars. I like the thick texture and opacity of the lipsticks, although I know that it isn’t going to be everyone’s cup of tea. I think that there are enough color options that everyone could find something that they would like, too. However, they can be untidy to apply (as seen in my lip swatch of Nantes) and I noticed that Nantes did stain my arm after the swatch, which should probably be expected of the darker colors in their line. *I would also like to note that the images on the site aren’t always representative of the actual colors, even though the descriptions are accurate. While my Nordic and Ukulele are pretty close to those shown on the site, my Nantes is noticeably darker than the site swatch. I would recommend looking around for swatches of specific colors on blogs if you’re considering buying.

Overall, I would repurchase these lipsticks.

Briefly, a cinemagraph may be described as a still photograph in which some repeated movement action occurs within a portion of a scene within the photograph. Cinemagraphs may be considered as something between a photograph and a video that seeks to capture a moment of action within an otherwise still photograph. In some aspects, a cinemagraph appears to the observer somewhat similar to an animated Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) image, a motion Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) image, or other video format. In these example motion images, a motion of some aspect of the image is perceived as a repeating or continued motion between images in the sequence of images.
While cinemagraphs provide for interesting animations, present approaches often require that the process of compositing the cinemagraph from a video sequence be performed manually using sometimes complex image editing software, often involving significant user interactions; and/or the use of tools which can only run on a personal computer or server, thus requiring the offloading of the captured video from the camera or mobile device to said computer—a burdensome and time consuming requirement. Many people may be reluctant to attempt to create cinemagraphs. Thus, there is a desire to provide improved mechanisms for creating of cinemagraphs, in a way which is both automatic and quick, providing the user with the result immediately on the camera without further intervention. Therefore, it is with respect to these considerations and others that the subject innovations have been made.

Dear readers,. I would like to create 15 Pdf's and 15 Mp3's for 15 different band instruments (Flute, Clarinet, Oboe, etc.) of "Row Row Row Your Boat" from one official version of sheet music.

Technology in the Classroom. Posted: Tue Jun 05, 2012 11:14 pm. As a future ESL teacher, I have come to realize that there is a huge shift in education to incorporate more technology into lessons and in the classroom. In my undergraduate education classes, I am required to include technology components into my lesson plans. I think it is important to find the right balance with how much technology you use in your lessons. I'm not sure how much technology would be considered too much, but you also want to make sure you use it enough to keep students engaged and are keeping up with the technology shift. What are some pros and cons with a constant use of technology? Also, what are some creative ways to use technology besides the standard PowerPoint presentation. I am new to the ESL field and don’t know how to be creative with technology. I also am concerned about cultural differences and students not knowing how to use certain technologies.

The later addition of a second sighting vane of another length, with a second scale calculated for it, provided a means to determine if the stave was in fact correctly placed relative to the eye by setting both vanes to the same angle marks on their respective scales and comparing them. But this could not actually be done during a sighting. A second problem was that the scale was not linear; the divisions are wide apart at low angles when the vane is well forward on the staff, but compacted when the vane is closer to the eye when high angles are being measured. These defects were inherent in the design of the instrument, and no later attempts at improvement could completely address them.

TOKYO — A former US nuclear regulator says cleaning up Japan’s wrecked Fukushima plant is a bigger challenge than the work he led at Three Mile Island and that ongoing radioactive water leaks are a minor part of that task.

Lake Barrett was appointed this month by plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. as an outside adviser for the decades-long decommissioning process. He led the Three Mile Island accident cleanup for nearly a decade as part of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

He said that the meltdowns in three of the reactors, massive radiation leaks, and the volume of contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, on Japan’s northeast coast, make it a more complicated cleanup.

‘‘In comparison to Three Mile Island, Fukushima is much more challenging, much more complex a job,’’ Barrett told a Tokyo news conference.

Compared to the magnitude of that task, the leakage problem is a ‘‘very low health impact and not a concern,’’ he told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview later Friday. The attention on the contaminated water leaks is ‘‘out of proportion,’’ and is hurting the overall cleanup process by slowing things down, he said.

The 1979 core melt accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania involved one reactor. All the radioactivity was contained in one building, where 8,000 tons of contaminated water were trapped.

In Fukushima, the catastrophe was precipitated by a massive earthquake and tsunami, whose aftermath are further adding to the difficulties of containing and cleaning up after the meltdowns of the three reactors. Moreover, buildings at the Japanese plant were destroyed or damaged by hydrogen explosions, which released massive radioactive elements into the air and sea.

But despite worries over the massive quantities of water needed to cool the reactors, the risk of radiation-contaminated water to public health is minimal, Barrett said.

Ringwood, Queensland

Ringwood is a locality in the Lockyer Valley Region, Queensland, Australia.

Geography 
Ringwood is located on the Warrego Highway which forms its southern boundary. The southern half of the locality is about 110–130 metres above sea level and is predominantly used for crops and grazing. The northern half is more rugged rising to an unnamed peak at 340 metres at the locality's north-western edge; this land is undeveloped bushland. The locality is almost entirely freehold land.

WASHINGTON — Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, could lose his seat to Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke because he is not likable enough, Office of Management and Budget Director suggested at a meeting of Republican National Committee donors in New York Saturday.

"Do people like you? That's a really important question," Mulvaney said, according to a person who was in the room. "What we have is a very real possibility we will win a race for Senate in Florida and lose a race in Texas for Senate. Ok. I don't think it's likely, but it's a possibility. How likable is the candidate? That still counts."

Some of his remarks were first reported by the New York Times on Saturday. Cruz's office did not immediately respond to NBC's request for comment.

"What we have is a very real possibility we will win a race for Senate in Florida and lose a race in Texas for Senate," Mulvaney told donors. "I don’t think it’s likely, but it’s a possibility. How likable is the candidate? That still counts.” Jacquelyn Martin / AP

Mulvaney, who did not use Cruz's name, was making a larger point that he believes the battle for control of Congress will be decided on a state-by-state and district-by-district level rather than the force of a political wave benefiting Democrats.

"Is this going to be the same thing for the Democrats as it was for the Republicans in 2010," when a Tea Party wave helped him win a House seat and gave Republicans control of the chamber. "I say this at the risk of giving the wrong answer to the question: the answer is no. It’s not."

Mulvaney said Democrats aren't bringing new voters into the process.

"It’s hard to bring new people in to a movement of hate," he said. "Anger doesn’t really attract people."

The other reason he doesn't see a wave, he said, is "we had a signature piece of legislation to run against. We had Obamacare. What is the signature piece of legislation that they’re against? The tax bill?"

Mulvaney said Republicans will win some races in which Democrats are favored and vice versa.

"What is going to be the distinguishing factor between those two outcomes?" he asked rhetorically. "Our candidates."

He pointed specifically to Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who lost a special election last year amid allegations of decades-old sexual misconduct.

"The president asks me all the time, why did Roy Moore lose?" he said. "That’s easy. He was a terrible candidate."

Blockbuster is losing big when it comes to at-home videos, so they are cutting back on expenses and on advertising in the U.S. to make up for it.. US same-store sales fell 15.9% in the 4Q and revenue dipped 18% to $1.08 billion compared to last year.. By closing its 500 weakest stores, the video-rental company hopes to reduce expenses by $200 million, the Financial Times reports.. Jim Keyes, chief executive officer, said the company was working with Rothschild, its financial advisors, on ways to increase its liquidity, including a possible recapitalisation.. Under Mr Keyes, Blockbuster is seeking to establish its brand in rapidly emerging new channels such as digital downloads and vending kiosks.. But they've already been beat to the punch. Netflix and Redbox dominate market share when it comes to digital downloads and vending kiosks, and Blockbuster will have a difficult time growing in those segments..

Patrick's pick for judge backs out. WBZ-AM. An Arlington attorney criticized for failing to disclose donations he made to two embattled politicians has withdrawn his candidacy to be a judge.. David Aptaker sent a letter to Gov. Deval Patrick Friday stating “an honest mistake on my part has become too much of a distraction in the approval process.”. Patrick had nominated him to be an associate justice of the Middlesex Family and Probate Court.. Aptaker donated $350 to former Middlesex Register of Probate John Buonomo and $200 to former state Sen. James Marzilli. Buonomo has since been convicted of theft and Marzilli resigned after being charged with sexual assault.. Judicial candidates are required to detail donations on a questionnaire.. The governor’s legal counsel, William “Mo” Cowan, says Patrick understands and respects Aptaker’s decision.

"`Feminism and Feminist Issues' is an anthology in which the ideas, observations
and perceptions of a set of esteemed authors are showcased in the form of research papers.
The papers deal with various aspects of feminism and feminist issues. Both feminism as
well as feminist issues are the topics of hot discussion in the global scenario. Wether in
an Indian village, across India, across the continent or across the globe, the status of
women remains the same. Woman is a vulnerable target for crime. The more of world tries
for empowering woman, the worse is her status in the world. It is quite shocking that
despite all the efforts by the Governments, NGOs and other organizations to ensure women
safely and to empower them, the rate of crime against women rockets up without any
restriction. Why? It remains as a puzzle. This anthology Feminism and Feminist Issues
deals with the status of women as it was, is and should be. It would be really an
eye-opener to all those who still keep an underestimated view about woman. It enlights the
readers with the innovative vision about woman and about how a society is expected to
treat its women. The esteemed authors of this anthology are from reputed institutions
across India. Their deliberations in this book give wider scope for aspiring youngsters to
explore deeper for effective research work."

Buried deep beneath the city’s main football stadium, the dance floor is an Olympic swimming pool (the DJs are at the deep end), Bassiani feels like the epitome of post-Soviet clubbing. It regularly attracts internationally famous artists, and has fostered its own line of Georgian DJs too (it even has its own record label). It's queer-friendly, dark and loud, though the place has some serious face control so don’t come in a suit. 2 Akaki Tsereteli Avenue

Diclofenac epolamine (Flector) patch: evidence for topical activity.
This review focuses on previously unpublished clinical and pharmacokinetic data with the diclofenac epolamine (diclofenac hydroxyethylpyrrolidine) patch supporting the hypothesis of a topical effect of this formulation. Previous studies have shown that 1 or 2 weeks of treatment with diclofenac epolamine provides pain relief for various localized musculoskeletal conditions such as ankle sprains, epicondylitis and knee osteoarthritis. The reduction in pain after application of the first patch in 155 patients with painful knee osteoarthritis was significant at the 1-hour time point and was superior to placebo at the 3-hour time point and at all time points thereafter. Comparable results were found in a study of 274 patients with acute ankle sprains, in which pain relief was also significantly superior to placebo at the 3-hour time point. Corresponding single-dose (patch) application for 12 hours in ten healthy volunteers demonstrated that diclofenac first appears in plasma at a mean of 4.5 hours after application (range 2-8 hours). Hence, the patch provided pain relief at a time point at which no diclofenac is assumed to be in plasma, which demonstrates local action in terms of tissue diclofenac accumulation under the patch. This is further supported by an apparent plasma diclofenac half-life of 9-12 hours after patch application, which implies the presence of a tissue reservoir, as the half-life after oral intake of diclofenac is 1-2 hours.Steady-state plasma diclofenac concentrations are present before 3 days' application (two patches/day) and are in the order of 1-3 ng/mL. The bioavailability in terms of systemic exposure from the patch compared with oral intake (75 mg/day) is in the order of 1%. Such low diclofenac concentrations are without systemic effects, as demonstrated by the fact that no drug-related gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers or cutaneous events characteristic of Steven-Johnson syndrome have been reported during 15 years of diclofenac epolamine patch use.These data provide support for the notion that diclofenac epolamine patch provides pain relief through accumulation of diclofenac under the site of application, without any evidence of systemic effects.

Quantitative shunt imaging in the evaluation of therapeutic surgery in a patient with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.
A case of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) in a 32-year-old woman who underwent successful left upper lobectomy is presented. A whole-body technetium-99m-labeled macro-aggregated albumin scan was used to demonstrate intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt, and shunt fraction was calculated as 39%. The patient underwent a follow-up scan after the operation; shunt fraction was calculated to be within normal limits (5%). The whole-body technetium-99m-labeled macro-aggregated albumin scan seems to be a simple and noninvasive test in the demonstration and quantitation of the degree of the right-to-left shunt in pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. The whole-body technetium-99m-labeled macro-aggregated albumin scan may also be useful for evaluation of the hemodynamic changes after surgical treatment and follow-up of the patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.

alloy article has a protective layer thereon, either in the form of an environmental coating or a the bond coat for a thermal barrier coating system. The protective layer has a high content of hafnium and/or zirconium to improve the adherence and properties of the protective layer. To introduce the hafnium and/or zirconium into the protective layer, the nickel-base alloy substrate, to which the protective layer is applied, is prepared with an initially elevated content of the hafnium and/or zirconium. A conventional bond coat is applied to the substrate. In an interdiffusion treatment performed during coating and/or subsequently, hafnium and/or zirconium diffuses from the substrate into the bond coat.

CA 125 in the management of endometriosis.
CA 125 is expressed by eutopic and ectopic endometrium. In women with advanced endometriosis, plasma concentrations are increased towards the end of the luteal phase and during menstruation but not during the follicular and early luteal phases. In women without endometriosis, such cyclic changes of CA 125 in plasma are not observed. In women with cystic ovarian endometriosis, plasma CA 125 concentrations are markedly elevated. Measurement of CA 125 in ovarian cyst fluid is the method of choice to differentiate a cystic corpus luteum from an ovarian endometriotic cyst, a frequent and difficult clinical problem. CA 125 can be used to diagnose deeply infiltrating endometriosis with a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 87%. These figures underestimate the clinical importance, since plasma CA 125 concentrations are mainly important for the diagnosis of deeply infiltrating endometriosis types II and III, which are the most severe forms and which are clinically easily missed. Because of the strong association of deep endometriosis and pelvic pain, the assay of CA 125 in plasma may be advocated in all women with unexplained pelvic pain as an aid in the diagnosis of deeply infiltrating endometriosis. Following surgical excision of endometriosis, CA 125 can be used to monitor the completeness of surgery.

It’s commonly found in curry. Curcumin occurs naturally in the spice turmeric and gives it that characteristic yellow color. People have been using curcumin in ancient Ayurvedic medicine for over 1000 years due to its wide-ranging health benefits. Curcumin is also commonly used in curries and cooking throughout Asia.. It’s safe to take. Unlike many modern medicines, the health benefits of curcumin are not tempered by problematic side-effects. Curcumin has low toxicity, and at worst, high doses have been known to cause stomach upsets.. It improves brain function. A recent long-term study has shown that a supplement of curcumin taken daily over 18 months improved cognition and recall ability in those over 50. It is thought that curcumin may work by breaking down the “gunk” that forms in the brain and which is thought to play a critical role in the development of Alzheimer’s.. The supplements were also shown to …

Worcestershire farm saved from £300,000 tax bill

A farm in Worcestershire has been saved after tax specialists successfully negotiated tax relief worth up to £300,000.

The land was owned by a mother and father but farmed by their son, who was at risk of being forced to sell when his parents both died within a short period of each other.

Gary Priest, partner at Midlands law firm mfg Solicitors, had been working for the family before the parents passed away.

Mr Priest reviewed the family’s complex position on inheritance tax to help them claim agricultural property relief (APR) which would otherwise have been denied due to the ownership arrangements.

The father and son went into business as partners, but the father needed to survive for two years for relief from inheritance tax.

He passed away within the two-year period. After he died, the mother and son went into partnership, but she also tragically died within two years of becoming a partner.

However, she inherited her late husband’s business activity, which added together, exceeded two years allowing the relief to be claimed.

Mr Priest said: “This was a complicated case underpinned by a family tragedy – the loss of two loving parents within a few years of each other.

“The APR to which the family should have been entitled was worth a colossal sum of money – potentially £300,000 - and if we had not acted while both parents were still alive, the entitlement to the money would have been lost forever.

“They were a genuine, hard-working farming family who just happened to have a business out of step with the rules until they sought the right legal advice.”

and

and two similar queries
select *
from news
where companyid = 1
    and date >= '01/01/2010'
    and date <= '01/31/2010'
order by date;

select *
from stockprices
where companyid = 1
    and date >= '01/01/2010'
    and date <= '01/31/2010'
order by date;

and I am getting two completely different actual execution plans
Query1: Relative to the batch: 86%  

SELECT (COST 0%) <- Nested Loops (Inneer Join)(Cost 0%) <- Index Seek (NonClustered) [News].[IX_Date](Cost 1%)
                                                          <- Key Lookup (Clustered) [News].[IX_CompanyId](Cost 99%)

Query 2: Relative to the batch: 14%  

SELECT (Cost0%) <- Sort (Cost 33%) <- Clustered Index Scan (Clustered) [StockPrices]IX_CompanyId

I am not sure why? Can you advice something?

A:

The first one is using a seek on a non covering clustered index in date order and a key lookup to get the remaining columns for rows matching companyid = 1.
The second one is doing a scan on a covering index and then sorting the filtered result. 
This is a cost based decision depending on what proportion of the table is estimated to match and the width of the two indexes (some example calculations here). 
Key lookups are expensive as each one requires performing a clustered index seek to locate the page and row concerned. This means multiple pages must be read for each row found by the nonclustered index seek (as many pages as the depth of the clustered index). Moreover the clustered index page found for one row may very likely not be correlated to the page for the next row, entailing lots of random IO.
As a result the tipping point before the plan switches to an index scan can be a very low proportion of the table. The fact that the non covering index can avoid a sort in this case may make the tipping point a bit higher than otherwise.
Look at the estimated rows from each. Also consider that the News table contains various string columns and likely fits less rows on a clustered index page than the numeric values in the StockPrices table - so a full clustered index scan on News may well be relatively more expensive and cause a higher tipping point.

Independent Co-Educational Day & Boarding School for Ages 2 - 18. The Best of British Boarding by the Sea.. Fantastic Year 6 transition day art lesson. Two groups of Year 6 students had short ‘taster’ lessons in art today as part of their experience in the Senior Department.. They learnt about the paper ‘cut outs’ by Matisse, and after reviewing and understanding the images, and use of formal elements such as shape, colour and composition, students responded by creating their own collages, inspired by natural, organic coral and leaf shapes.. Each student’s work has been combined together to produce two large scale pieces.. The groups worked very well and showed good potential as future artists! Hope they enjoyed their day!

Lansdowne Station. Baltimore, MD. - 3 Levels. - 641 Parking Spaces. Lansdowne Station is a new redevelopment project just inside the Baltimore beltway on Washington Boulevard (Route 1). The redevelopment project includes over 400,000 sf. of retail space, 55,000 sf. of office space and a new parking structure.. KEC was the engineer of record for design of the entire garage from foundations through the roof, including integral retaining walls. One unique aspect of the garage is that it is designed to incorporate retail space at the ground level with parking above. With 60 ft by 27 ft. typical bay sizes, the design using post-tensioned concrete provides expansive column-free space for retail businesses at the ground level. The store front is built integrally with the concrete frame without the need for additional steel framing for the stores.

Isotropic blackbody cosmic microwave background radiation as evidence for a homogeneous universe.
The question of whether the Universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic on the largest scales is of fundamental importance to cosmology but has not yet been answered decisively. Surprisingly, neither an isotropic primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) nor combined observations of luminosity distances and galaxy number counts are sufficient to establish such a result. The inclusion of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in CMB observations, however, dramatically improves this situation. We show that even a solitary observer who sees an isotropic blackbody CMB can conclude that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic in their causal past when the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect is present. Critically, however, the CMB must either be viewed for an extended period of time, or CMB photons that have scattered more than once must be detected. This result provides a theoretical underpinning for testing the cosmological principle with observations of the CMB alone.

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of isoeugenol (CAS No. 97-54-1) in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice (gavage studies).
Isoeugenol is one of several structurally similar phenylpropenoid compounds produced by plants. It has been extracted from calamus, savory, basil, ylang-ylang, clove, tuberose, jonquil, nutmeg, tobacco, sandalwood, dill seed, mace, gardenia, petunia, and other flowers. Isoeugenol can also be produced by isomerization of eugenol, which occurs naturally in clove, pimento, bay leaf, and cinnamon. As a fragrance with a spicy, carnation-like odor, isoeugenol is incorporated into numerous household and personal hygiene products, including perfumes, cream lotions, soaps, and detergents. As a flavoring agent, isoeugenol is added to nonalcoholic drinks, baked foods, and chewing gums. Isoeugenol was nominated by the National Cancer Institute and was selected for carcinogenicity testing because of widespread human exposure through its use as a flavoring and fragrance agent and because of its structural similarity to phenylpropenoids such as safrole, isosafrole, eugenol, methyleugenol, estragole, and anethole, most of which are known rodent carcinogens. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were administered isoeugenol (99% or greater pure) in corn oil by gavage for 3 months or 2 years. Genetic toxicity tests were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study except one 600 mg/kg male and one 37.5 mg/kg female that were killed in dosing accidents. Mean body weights of all exposed groups of males were significantly less than that of the vehicle control group; however, only the decrease for the 600 mg/kg group exceeded 10% and was considered related to isoeugenol exposure. Liver weights were significantly increased in 300 and 600 mg/kg females. The incidences of minimal atrophy of the olfactory epithelium of the nose were significantly increased in 150 mg/kg or greater males and in 300 or 600 mg/kg females. The incidence of atrophy of olfactory nerve bundles was significantly increased in 600 mg/kg females. Minimal to mild periportal hepatocellular cytoplasmic alteration occurred in all 300 or 600 mg/kg females. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. The mean body weight of 600 mg/kg males was significantly less (12%) than that of the vehicle controls. Liver weights of 300 and 600 mg/kg males were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. Minimal to moderate atrophy of olfactory epithelial tissue and nerve bundles was observed in 600 mg/kg males and females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 105 weeks. Survival rates of exposed male and female rats were similar to those of vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 300 mg/kg male rats were 9% greater than the vehicle controls at the end of the study. The general lack of toxicity and nonneoplastic lesions indicates that rats might have been able to tolerate higher doses. Two male rats in the 300 mg/kg group had rare benign or malignant thymomas, while two other males in this group had rare mammary gland carcinomas. Low incidences of minimal atrophy and minimal to mild respiratory metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium were increased in 150 mg/kg males and 300 mg/kg males and females. Similar incidences of minimal to mild olfactory epithelial degeneration in 300 mg/kg males were also increased. Incidences of keratoacanthoma of the skin were decreased in 150 and 300 mg/kg males. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 104 (females) or 105 (males) weeks. Survival of 300 mg/kg males was significantly decreased compared to the vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 300 mg/kg male and female groups were less than those of vehicle controls at the end of the study, 10% and 15% less, respectively. In all groups of exposed males, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly greater than those in the vehicle control group; incidences of multiple hepatocellular adenoma were also significantly increased. Incidences of clear cell focus were significantly increased in 75 and 150 mg/kg male mice. There was a significant positive trend in the incidences of histiocytic sarcoma in females, and this neoplasm occurred in multiple tissues. Incidences of respiratory metaplasia in olfactory epithelium in all exposed groups and of atrophy and hyaline droplet accumulation in all exposed groups except 75 mg/kg females were significantly greater than those in corresponding vehicle control groups. Incidences of minimal to marked hyperplasia of Bowman's gland were increased significantly in all exposed groups. Incidences of minimal to mild necrosis of renal papilla and mild to moderate necrosis of renal tubules were increased significantly in 300 mg/kg females. Incidences of forestomach squamous hyperplasia, inflammation, and ulceration (males only) increased with exposure and were significant in the 300 mg/kg groups. The incidence of glandular stomach ulcers was low but significantly increased in the 300 mg/kg groups. Isoeugenol was not mutagenic in two independent assays in bacteria (S. typhimurium and E. coli) conducted with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S9 liver enzymes). Neither did it induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9 activation. Frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were not increased in peripheral blood of male mice exposed to isoeugenol by gavage for 3 months; however, an increasing trend and a threefold increase in the 600 mg/kg group indicate a positive result for this test in female mice. Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of rarely occurring thymoma and mammary gland carcinoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in female F344/N rats administered 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined). There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of histiocytic sarcoma. Exposure to isoeugenol resulted in nonneoplastic lesions of the nose in male and female rats; of the nose, forestomach, and glandular stomach in male and female mice; and of the kidney in female mice.

So the postman came a little while ago..... Amongst the crap there were two things of note. Firstly a letter confirming that I had been unsuccessful in a job interview earlier this week. Second the new Howies winter catalogue arrived :o). Regular readers might have notices that my posting frequency has been rather low over the last few weeks. Truth be told, this whole job thing has been playing on my mind. It's been something I've been thinking about a great deal, but I've not really wanted to share about it on here. As I like my writings on here to be about stuff that I'm currently thinking about, I've kinda opted for not sharing much at all.. Sorry.. Anyway, life goes on, I'm just off into our local secondary school to have a chat with the head of R.E., and then I'm helping out at their new after-school club. I get to play with computers and things. Tis a hard life I know.

District nursing origins can be traced back to 1859 when philanthropist William Rathbone pioneered the provision of nursing within poorer communities. 1887 saw the Queen’s Nurses established and in 1889 a training institute was set up in Edinburgh. For over 100 years, Queen’s Nurses promoted health and wellbeing in the communities of Scotland. Today, the Queen’s Nursing Institute Scotland promotes excellence in community nursing to improve the health and well-being of the people of Scotland. Dr Alison O’Donnell (RCN History of Nursing Society) and Clare Cable (QNIS Chief Executive and Nurse Director) will explore the fascinating history of the QNIS, focussing on the role which Queen’s Nurses adopted in health promotion. This presentation will draw on materials from the QNIS Archive, maintained by the RCN.

Gatorade: Oswaldo Vizcarrondo Campaign. All soccer fans know that Oswaldo Vizcarrondo is famous for his attitude towards hard work and perseverance. Those are two values that our client, Gatorade, relied on to tell the story of one of the most important athletes of Venezuela's national soccer team in the last decade.. While recording this video in Argentina and Venezuela we discovered exactly how serious and determined an aspiring soccer player has to be to make the leap to the International level. The focus of Gatorade during this documentary was to capture people’s attention and to inspire them to be like Vizcarrondo.

Step 11: Darken the shapes of Pluto's eyes, and draw a long oval inside each eye for his pupils. Shade in the pupils except for a small circle on the top that represents glare.. Step 12: On top of Pluto's eyes, draw a curved line that resembles the lowercase letter m. This is Pluto's brow.. Step 13: Move on to drawing Pluto's jaw. Inside the U shape below the top part of his muzzle, draw two of lines to create the inside of his mouth. Then at the bottom of it, draw a couple of curved lines make Pluto's tongue.. Step 14: Finish drawing Pluto's lower jaw by following the initial line as a guide and curving it all the way up to his ear.. Step 15: To draw Pluto's ear, simply darken the shape and close the curve at the top with a rounded curve. Draw a couple of curved lines on top to represent folds of skin.

The Yankees have sold Triple-A first baseman Steve Pearce to the Baltimore Orioles for cash after he exercised a June 1 opt-out clause in his contract, according to Chad Jennings of the Journal News.. Pearce, 29-years-old, absolutely crushed the ball at Triple-A this season. In 52 games he had an amazing line of .321/.422/.574/.996. Usually a line like that would at least get a team to give you a chance in The Show, but the Yankees were set at first base and with Eric Chavez healthy it didn’t make a lot of sense to promote him.. So they sold his rights to the Orioles rather than lose him for nothing. Hard to blame them for that, but hopefully it doesn’t come back to haunt them as he will join the O’s Major League team.

NE 45th Street Viaduct

Seattle's topography has always been a challenge to transportation, especially along west to east routes. A concerted effort in the 1930s to ease automobile traffic led to a series of bridge projects including construction of the NE 45th St Viaduct that would provide a direct route from Sand Point Way and Laurelhurt to Highway 99. At that time, the land at the base was mostly farmland. The project was approved in 1935 by Ordinance 65629 with major community support from the University Commercial Club. Construction did not begin until 1938. (The street designation was E 45th Street until 1961 when the directional designation was changed to NE.)

The viaduct was funded with a combination of federal Public Works Administration (PWA) dollars ($103,550), state gasoline tax revenue ($200,000), and a small appropriation in 1939 from the City Street Fund ($8,000). Other PWA-funded projects in 1938 included the Montlake Boulevard pedestrian overcrossing, 24th Avenue Southwest paving, East Madison Street repaving, and the Ballard Bridge.

The project was completed in September 1939 with great fanfare. A celebration luncheon was held at the Edmond Meany Hotel on September 28, followed by a parade that included the Husky Marching Band. The procession made its way from the Meany to the dedication ceremonies where Mayor Langlie cut the ribbon in front of several thousand spectators.

In 1955, funds were approved to widen the viaduct from two to three lanes; construction took place in 1956-1957. The construction was estimated to cost $192,000 and the funds were approved as part of a $10 million traffic improvement bond issue approved by Seattle voters in 1954. Additional funds for this project were approved in 1956, increasing the appropriation from $218,000 to $248,000. A 1956 scale of wages shows that carpenters earned $2.80 per hour in that year. The additional funds in 1956 were for a bus stop and for approaches to University Village. During the construction, traffic was limited to one lane eastbound. Westbound traffic was asked to detour to Blakely Avenue and Ravenna Place. Once the construction was finished, two lanes were designated for westbound traffic and one for eastbound. By the mid-1950s, the farmland was gone, but a Carnation plant and Shell station could be seen on NE 45th.

During a 1972 Engineering Department survey of bridge needs, it became evident that the wooden trestles on the east end of the viaduct were compromised by a 1966 fire and needed to be replaced. After two public hearings, it was determined that there would be no big changes to the viaduct. Work began in January 1976. Federal funds were used to help fund the project, and additional funds were approved in 1976 for rail replacement. In 1976, carpenters earned $8.90 per hour. For various reasons, mostly related to the pilings used and the noise of the pile-driving machine, the work took longer than expected. Neighborhood groups and businesses, as well as the University of Washington, made their concerns about the delay known to the City. The viaduct was closed from January to October 17th, 1976.

In 1983, City funds were approved for deck rehabilitation on the viaduct. Adverse weather and an initial unavailability of specialized equipment needed for the project required the completion date to be postponed until the spring of 1984. A temporary asphalt overlay was installed to enable the viaduct to be used during the time construction was stopped and restarted.

After a fire in January 1996, the viaduct was briefly closed so an inspection could be made of the supports on the west end.

In 2010, the viaduct was closed again for several months for a major project to replace the west approach. Portions of the approach dated back to 1938 and needed to be replaced for safety reasons. The project was budgeted at $30 million and was expected to last about six months.

Rising to the Challenge for Alzheimer’s. GEW’s UK Sales Manager, Chris Nuttall, has recently successfully completed the arduous Three Peaks Challenge in aid of charity. Chris and his teammates took on the challenge on 29th June, which unfortunately for them also turned out to be one of the hottest days of the year. Nevertheless, they persevered and completed the course in only 11 hours and 48 minutes.. In what can only be described as blistering heat, they set out on the 26-mile challenge across the three highest peaks in Yorkshire, all in aid of a great cause. The training they had put in stood them in good stead, although Chris commented afterwards that ‘his feet told a different story’.. Chris thanked everyone at GEW for their sponsorship and support, which contributed to the highly impressive total sum raised… Chris’s NuttyBullers Team raised a massive £3,093.42 for The Alzheimer’s Society.

Effect of interaction with coesite silica on the conformation of Cecropin P1 using explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulation.
Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out for the antimicrobial peptides (i) Cecropin P1 and C-terminus cysteine modified Cecropin P1 (Cecropin P1 C) in solution, (ii) Cecropin P1 and Cecropin P1 C adsorbed onto coesite -Si - O - and Si - O - H surfaces, and (iii) Cecropin P1 C tethered to coesite -Si - O - surface with either (PEO)(3) or (PEO)(6) linker. Low energy structures for Cecropin P1 and Cecropin P1 C in solution consists of two regions of high α helix probability with a sharp bend, consistent with the available structures of other antimicrobial peptides. The structure of Cecropin P1 C at low ionic strength of 0.02 M exhibits two regions of high α helix probability (residues AKKLEN and EGI) whereas at higher ionic strength of 0.12 M, the molecule was more compact and had three regions of higher α helix probability (residues TAKKLENSA, ISE, and AIQG) with an increase in α helical content from 15.6% to 18.7% as a result of shielding of electrostatic interactions. In the presence of Cecropin P1 C in the vicinity of -Si - O - surface, there is a shift in the location of two peaks in H - O - H density profile to larger distances (2.95 Å and 7.38 Å compared to 2.82 Å and 4.88 Å in the absence of peptide) with attenuated peak intensity. This attenuation is found to be more pronounced for the first peak. H-bond density profile in the vicinity of -Si - O - surface exhibited a single peak in the presence of Cecropin P1 C (at 2.9 Å) which was only slightly different from the profile in the absence of polypeptide (2.82 Å) thus indicating that Cecropin P1 C is not able to break the H-bond formed by the silica surface. The α helix probability for different residues of adsorbed Cecropin P1 C on -Si - O - surface is not significantly different from that of Cecropin P1 C in solution at low ionic strength of 0.02 M whereas there is a decrease in the probability in the second (residues ISE) and third (residues AIQG) α helical regions at higher ionic strength of 0.12 M. Though the total α helical content of adsorbed and tethered Cecropin P1 C was lower for hydrophilic Si - O - H surface compared to hydrophobic -Si - O -, hydrophobicity of the surface did not significantly affect the α helix probability of different residues. The conformation of Cecropin P1 C in solution is closer to that of tethered to -Si - O - with (PEO)(6) than that tethered with (PEO)(3) as a result of less surface interaction of tethered polypeptide with a longer linker. At low ionic strength of 0.02 M, tethered Cecropin P1 C to -Si - O - is found to exhibit lower α helix (13.0%) compared to adsorbed (15.6%) for (PEO)(3) linker with this difference being insignificant for larger (PEO)(6) linker molecule. Experimental values of % α helix inferred from circular dichroism spectra of Cecropin P1 in solution as well as in adsorbed state on silica surface compared well with the corresponding values obtained from MD simulation thereby validating the simulation procedure.

Structure and thermal expansion of the tungsten bronze Pb₂KNb₅O₁₅.
The structure and thermal expansion behavior of the tetragonal tungsten bronze oxide Pb2KNb5O15 were investigated by neutron powder diffraction and high-temperature X-ray diffraction. Below the Curie temperature, T(C) (orthorhombic phase, T(C) ≈ 460 °C), the cell parameters a and c increase with temperature, while b decreases. The thermal expansion coefficients are α(a) = 1.29 × 10(-5) °C(-1), α(b) = -1.56 × 10(-5) °C(-1), and α(c) = 1.62 × 10(-5) °C(-1). Temperature-dependent second harmonic generation (SHG), dielectric, and polarization-electrical field (P-E) hysteresis loop measurements were performed to study the symmetry and electric properties. We show that the distortion and cooperative rotation of NbO6 octahedrons are directly responsible for the negative thermal expansion coefficient along the polar b axis. It is suggested that Pb-O covalency, especially in the large and asymmetric pentagonal prisms, may be related to orthorhombic distortion and abnormal spontaneous polarization along the b axis. This study shows that tungsten bronze families are possible candidates for exploring negative thermal expansion materials.

So let’s get out of the weeds and talk about some high level scenarios that might resonate for your organization.. Employee appreciation is normally one of the biggest drivers of employee engagement. Employees want to be recognized for doing a good job, making an extra effort or just solid and steady performance as a dependable team member. So what can be done? Here are a few ideas:.

First prize!. Just heard that Flip has won the 2012 Immanuel College Book Award, voted for by pupils at the independent school in Hertfordshire . . . my first prize as a teen/YA author! (I was starting to get twitchy – from 13 shortlistings and longlistings, FLIP hasn’t won any of the seven prizes that have declared so far.). I’m especially flattered to have won this one, given the strength of the shortlist – Gregory Hughes, Patrick Ness, Garth Nix, Delphine de Vigan and Carlos Ruiz Zafon. My spy in the camp tells me Flip pipped Mr Ness’s excellent A Monster Calls by eight votes. I am very grateful to all the pupils who voted for my novel and to Ethan Cohen, in Year 7, who nominated it in the first place.

The business of a contact center is to provide rapid and efficient interaction between agents and customers, or prospective customers, using various interaction methods and media, including phone, fax, e-mail and messaging. A manager in a contact center typically uses force management software (FMS) to produce a schedule that includes agents assigned to work activities for specific time periods. During the workday, the FMS produces staffing statistics. The manager uses staffing statistics to adjust the number of agents assigned to particular activities when the contact center performance is either above or below contact center goals (e.g., a desired service level.) If performance exceeds the goals, the manager can reduce the number of agents. If performance does not meet goals, the manager can add more agents to the schedule.
Skills-based routing attempts to find the best available match between the needs of the customer and the various proficiencies or skills of available agents. Providing staffing statistics in a skills-based environment is difficult. One problem is providing an accurate count of agents. A multi-skill agent could be counted against more than one (skill) queue. A conventional FMS simply counts an agent with multiple skills against all queues, resulting in an miscount. Furthermore, a conventional FMS reports one combined count, rather than a count for each skill-related queue.

Hu arrives in Sudan

Hu's visit comes amid hopes he would push Khartoum to co-operate with the UN on Darfur.

02 Feb 2007 10:25 GMT

Hu Jintao, seen here in Liberia, is on an eight-nation Africa tour [AFP]

"I am extremely happy to visit Sudan at the invitation of president Omar al-Bashir," Hu said in a statement at the airport.

"Although the distance between China and Sudan is great, the friendship between the two people is deeply rooted."

'Bilateral relations'

A small crowd of Chinese residents and Chinese UN peacekeepers here waved Chinese and Sudanese flags as the two leaders reviewed a presidential guard.

Officials in Khartoum said Hu's visit was geared toward "bilateral relations and other important issues of common interest," without specifying if these would be commercial matters or would include human rights issues.

But Beijing has raised expectations that Hu may bring some pressure on Khartoum to show flexibility in ending Darfur's bloodshed.

Chinese officials ahead of Hu's visit urged Sudan to cooperate in finding a solution in Darfur in rare public pronouncements under China's traditional refusal to interfere in what it considers other countries' internal affairs.

"This visit is going to be a great boost for the distinguished Sudanese-Chinese relations in various fields," al-Bashir said on Thursday.

China, which is the biggest foreign investor in Sudan and buys two-thirds of the country's oil exports, has used its veto-wielding status at the UN security council to prevent harsh measures against Sudan over the Darfur conflict.

Sudan has refused demands it allow UN peacekeepers into the region, calling "neocolonial" a UN security council plan to replace an overwhelmed African Union force in the region with some 22,000 UN peacekeepers.

Dental caries, sugar-eating habits and toothbrushing in groups of 4-year-old children 1967-1997 in the city of Umeå, Sweden.
Four-year-old children in the city of Umeå, northern Sweden, have been the subjects for studies of dental caries at regular intervals between 1967 and 1997. Similar methods and criteria were used in all studies and the children were selected from the same catchment areas. The results of this study signified a shift in the trend towards a declining caries prevalence among 4-year-old children. There was a slight non-significant increase in the number of children with caries as well as in the mean dmft and dmfs values between 1992 and 1997. The mean dmfs value was 7.8 in 1967 and declined to 4.5 in 1971. It was 2.9 in 1976 and 2.0 in 1980 and 1987, 1.8 in 1992 and increased to 2.0 in 1997. Ten percent of the children were immigrant or refugee children in 1997 compared to 6% in 1992 and they had a significantly higher caries prevalence than children with a Swedish background (p<0.001). In 1997, 58% of the children had one or more daily intakes of sugary snacks such as buns, cakes sweets, soft drinks, etc. There was an increasing consumption of sweets and soft drinks between 1987 and 1997.

The Tokyo Sky Tree is a broadcasting tower under construction in the Narihirabashi/Oshiage area of the Sumida ward in Tokyo, Japan. After the construction completes, it will be the tallest artificial structure in Japan at a height of 634.00 m (2,080 ft). The present Tokyo Tower (333 m) is not tall enough for complete digital terrestrial television broadcasting coverage due to the construction of many high rise buildings in the central part of the Tokyo Metropolis..

The group drove out of the airport with $5 million in cash before police arrived. Nobody was arrested.. “Everyone who passes through the Viracopos Airport is at the mercy of thugs,” said Alberto Carvalho, a director at the National Union of Airport Workers, who has documented several instances of muggings, carjackings and kidnappings of employees in the vicinity of the airport. The highway that leads to the airport is notorious for crime, and several kidnapping attempts on the road made headlines here in recent years. “The airport is completely unprepared to deal with these risks,” Carvalho said.. The heist is part of a crime wave that has made transporting goods in Brazil particularly dangerous...”. Read more:

Half of the American electorate now agree with President Trump about special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia collusion investigation.

The results from a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll released Monday show 50 percent of registered voters agree with Trump's claim that he is the target of a "witch hunt" and that he has been subject to more investigations than his predecessors due to politics.

Forty-seven percent of respondents disagreed, while 3 percent had no opinion.

The poll was conducted following reports in recent weeks indicating Mueller was winding down after 34 people and three companies have been indicted or taken guilty pleas as part of the investigation, none having to do with Russian collusion. However, the special counsel's office said Friday former Trump campaign official Rick Gates is still helping "several ongoing investigations," indicating the probe still has a ways to go.

The poll also took place after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort got sentenced to roughly seven and a half years in prison for conspiracy and fraud, far less time than what Mueller's prosecutors recommended.

The newly released phone survey of 1,000 voters was conducted Wednesday through Sunday as Trump tweeted more barbs at Mueller, including one on Friday that asserted Mueller should not have been appointed and there should be no report from the special counsel. "This was an illegal & conflicted investigation in search of a crime," Trump said.

The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, showed a stark partisan divide, with 86 Republicans agreeing Trump is the victim of a "witch hunt." Among Democrats, the number was significantly lower, 14 percent, but among independents 54 percent agreed, while 42 percent did not.

[Byron York: With Mueller office emptying, dramatic predictions remain unfulfilled]

Bayalaata

Bayalāṭa  or Bayalāṭada () is a form of Yakshagana found in southern Indian region of Karnataka featuring stories from Indian epic poetry and the Puranas rendered as dance and drama. Bayalāṭa literally means open theater drama and marks the end of harvest season. The most popular theme for bayalāṭa is the story of Kōṭi and Cennayya, which has deep-rooted significance for the people of Tulu Nadu. There are generally five types of Bayalayas -Dasarat,Sannata,Doddata,Parikatha and Yakshanaga .Parijat and Yakshagana are narrated by single sutradhar while other three forms are performed in corus of three-four, aided by Vidhushaka.

The Yakshagana stage is set before the village temple on a sandy beach or in open fields. A low platform about 16' 10 20' with bamboo poles at each corner garlanded with flowers, plantain and mango leaves, and roofed with matted palm leaves. At sunset the sound of a chande, a high pitched drum, announces forthcoming performances.

Browsing Medical Oncology by Subjects. Now showing items 1-1 of 1. - Imaging in gastrointestinal stromal tumours: current status and future directions.Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) have distinct biological and treatment-related features posing challenges for imaging. In this review the importance of imaging in different stages of patient management is discussed, emphasizing the unique characteristics of GISTs. Potential pitfalls of using the standard response criteria on conventional imaging have been highlighted. These include size measurements, which may not adequately reflect response rates, pseudo-progression, and spurious new lesions. Furthermore, the role of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in early response evaluation and in the detection of both primary and acquired resistance is explored. The current role and future directions of use of both conventional and metabolic imaging in the management of GISTs are discussed.

Don't get so caught up in SAT scores and grades+ READ ARTICLE. In an era of rising tuition and worries about “paper classes,” it’s easy for students (and parents) to get overwhelmed about making the right decisions during the college admissions process.. Admissions expert Pamela Donnelly, author of the recently published 4 Keys to College Admissions Success, offers several tips for families looking for a way to stay sane.. The process “is a blip on the chart of a much larger movie called life,” Donnelly says, encouraging students to not get so caught up on SAT scores and grades that it becomes overwhelming. Once applications are in, Donnelly wants students to “let it go” and celebrate the completion of the process rather than stressing about where they may get in.. Catch more of her tips in the video above.

Q:

How to input password to git pull command?

I have written scripts for Windows and Linux to essentially set up a new users workspace with all the git repositories from our server.
I would like the user to enter the password for our server once, store it in a local variable, pass that variable to each git pull command, then erase the password variable and exit.
How can I input the password when the git pull command requests it? Both for Windows batch file and a Linux shell script.
Here is code from the Linux script:
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter password: "
read pswd
clear #No screen peaking

#This is repeated for each repo
location=folderName
mkdir $location
cd $location
git init
git remote add origin git@<server>:$location.git
git pull origin master 
#Above prompts for password & is where I want to automatically input $pswd

I've tried various things recommended on SO and elsewhere, such as piping, reading from .txt file, etc. I would prefer to not need anything more than plain old windows cmd and Linux terminal commands. And as this script is just for set up purposes, I do not need to securely store the password permanently with something like ssh agent.
I'm running Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.10, but this script is meant for setting up new users, so it should ideally work on most distributions.

A:

Synopsis:
git pull "https://<username>:<password>@github.com/<github_account>/<repository_name>.git" <branch_name>

Example:
git pull "https://admin:12345@github.com/Jet/myProject.git" master

Note: This works for me on a bash script

A:

I would really recommend to not try and manage that password step, and delegate that (both on Linux and Windows) to git credential helper.
See:

"Git http - securely remember credentials"
"How to use git with gnome-keyring integration"

The user will enter the password only once per session.

This valley is a strange 196-mile (315km) scar that sits almost right in the middle of the Martian equator on the northern edge of the Valles Marineris canyon, almost 8 km-deep trough stretching 315 km in an east-west direction and 125 km from north to south at its widest point.

Q:

Git repo access issue

I have added ssh key to my git repo through below command and now getting below error:
CMD git config --global url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf https://github.com/

 Error : User1’s-MacBook-Pro:untitled folder ndpiparava$ git clone  https://github.com/XXX-Asft/XXXX
Cloning into 'XXXXX'...
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

I have realised that I have made mistake by setting up ssh instead of Https.
Is there any way that I can remove my ip from ssh list for my remote git and start using https?

A:

git config --global url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf https://github.com/

This means any url starting with https://github.com/ will be rewritten with ssh://git@github.com/.
There is no "ip from ssh list for my remote git" to remove.  
You can simply delete that global config setting.
git config --global --unset url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf

And you can remove your public key you set on your GitHub account.



Written by the B&B Crew. Thursday, 29 July 2010 15:00. Trusted Fully Cycle and Reprazent member Krust is about to launch his label Rebel Instinct. Krust himself sees it more of a "creative hub, an outlet for all of his own creative projects", but that's pretty much the definition of a label now isn't it?. Next to being an outlet for all or Krust's own creative projects, the label will also function as a breeding ground for new talent. The label is said to be a hub where likeminded people can work on their ideas alone or together. "Krust: At its heart it is an entertainment company with social implication."The coming months will see Krust releasing his own material on the label as well as a book titled Look Before You Leap which will feature additional music from George Kurtz, Mark Day and Krust's own band The Rules..

Efficacy of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage (PTCD) in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.
For patients with pancreatic cancer who suffer from obstructive jaundice, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage (PTCD) is the treatment of choice. However, there are no standards for palliative care for patients undergoing this treatment. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of post-palliative treatment in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer who were previously treated with PTCD. The 47 patients included in this study had unresectable pancreatic cancer, presented with obstructive jaundice, had no prior history of chemotherapy, and underwent PTCD. They were divided into two groups. Group A was composed of 21 patients who received post-palliative treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, or chemoradiotherapy). Group B consisted of 26 patients who were under best supportive care (BSC). We compared the median overall survival time between the two groups to evaluate the efficacy of post-palliative treatment. The median overall survival time (MOST) of patients undergoing PTCD was 7.19 months. MOST was 9.07 months for patients in group A (P = 0.017 vs. group B) and 5.52 months for those in group B. Among the patients receiving post-palliative treatment, 12 (57% of patients) received only a single therapy (either chemo or radiation), and 9 (43%) received chemoradiotherapy. Their median overall survival times were 8.31 and 11.15 months, respectively (P = 0.325). Post-palliative treatment in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer previously treated with PTCD is more effective than only best supportive care alone. Patients receiving both chemo and radiation may benefit more in terms of overall survival compared to patients receiving only one or the other.

The other day, one of the buddies of Governor Doug "Cup or Waffle Cone" Ducey was quoted as saying that Arizona needed to get rid of Common Core and instead institute "Arizona" standards for education.. What makes this so funny is that Arizona has no education standards. We've proved this for many years now. Many of our elected officials are proud of this fact. Indeed, they run on a promise of maintaining it. And since they continue to be elected and re-elected, the typical Arizona voter must agree with them.. We also have no standards for political candidates. We prove this on a daily, if not hourly, basis, too.. Obviously, these two missing standards go hand in 29, 2015. Today's Chuckle

(VIDEO) How to Improve PPC CampaignsWritten by Pace Lattin. September 23, 2013 # 9:27 am # Expert Guides, Specials #. Great article I agree with all of the above. Only bit I’d add is a clear focus on the call to action itself. A PPC or Pay-per-action campaign can be great tools, but the action itself better be something that converts those leads into customers or you’re still going to see that high bounce rate.. Particularly liked the competitor idea, I hadn’t thought of that strategy in the Adwords environment..

Oxfam’s new report, ‘Reward Work, Not Wealth,’ reveals how the global economy enables the wealthy elite to capture vast wealth while hundreds of millions of people struggle to survive on poverty pay.. Eighty two percent of the wealth generated last year went to the richest one percent of the global population, while the 3.7 billion people who make up the poorest half of the world saw no increase in their wealth. This research includes the stunning new finding that the economy created a new billionaire every other day over a period of one year. The report is being released as political and business elites, including President Trump, are heading to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum..  as Reward Work, Not Wealth.

Mechanism of the inhibitory action of linoleic acid on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
Linoleic acid, but not stearic acid, inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 8325. Growth inhibition was associated with an increase in the permeability of the bacterial membrane. The presence of a plasmid conferring resistance to penicillin (PC plasmid, e.g. pI258blaI-) increased the growth inhibitory and membrane permeability effects of linoleic acid. Under growth inhibitory conditions, linoleic acid was incorporated into the lipid of both PC plasmid-containing and PC plasmid-negative bacteria and there was little difference between these cultures in the uptake or fate of linoleic acid. Experiments using a glycerol auxotroph of S. aureus suggested that free linoleic acid, rather than lipid containing this acid, inhibits growth. Linoleic acid probably inhibits growth by increasing the permeability of the bacterial membrane as a result of its surfactant action, and the presence of the PC plasmid increases these effects.

Effect of processing parameters on the electrophoretic deposition of carbon black nanoparticles in moderately viscous systems.
Polymer-melt-based manufacturing processes for nanostructures offer high-rate, environmentally friendly, and commercially viable alternatives to solution-based methods. In this work, electrophoresis of a model carbon black and polystyrene system with moderate viscosity was used to investigate the viability of adapting nanoassembly processes to the high viscosity environment of polymer melts. The presence of polystyrene did not prevent deposition of carbon black, but deposition rates decreased at shorter deposition times; deposition was not linear with increasing applied voltage; and greater solution concentrations reduced the critical voltages (i.e., the voltage at which the rate of deposition changed). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results and comparison of experimental data with Hamaker's model showed that about 1.6% of the available polystyrene was initially deposited with the carbon black. At voltages above the critical voltage, the deposited mass was less than the Hamaker prediction, indicating the formation of electrically insulating layers on the electrodes. The overall behavior suggests that polymer melt-based processes could be employed for high-rate fabrication of nano-optical devices, biochemical sensors, and nanoelectronics.

Something familiar - I hope. The grid produced by Romek Marber for the standard penguin paperback jacket. Consistency and an underlying structure are the watchwords for the book project. Marber's grid was the skeleton for hundreds of book jackets it enabled variety and diversity whilst maintaining a visual/branded consistency that made the appreciation of difference all the more acute - arguably the grid creates opportunity for the Illustrator/Designer. So thinking about a 'system' for the book products when considering option 1 bear in mind that a visual structure, like the underlying grid, gives you a certain secure freedom.

Because salmon is packed with so much protein, it is extremely easy to digest and only takes about 12 hours to do so. There are other types of seafood such as shrimp and calamari which can take up to 24 hours to digest and they are considered to be the â€œheavyâ€ types of seafood.. Red meat can also take a long time to go through the digestive tract which is why it shouldnâ€™t be consumed on a regular basis but rather in moderation. There are a number of great things about salmon, including the high amount of omega-3 fatty acids in it which can do all sorts of great things for the brain.

The pick-up sensors are characterised by extreme long life due to their non-contacting and therefore almost wear-free mode of operation. Measurements are carried out by scanning a gear tooth or pulse wheel. The speed sensor is placed at a particular distance above the wheel.. Pick-up sensors use the Hall effect to capture driving speed. Rotational direction can also be determined. Two Hall elements are arranged in a relative geometrical position to one another within the pick-up sensor so that both revolution and rotational direction can be determined. The output levels of both receivable signals, galvanically separated from each other, are processed for a wide range of supply voltages.

Milyika Carroll

Milyika Carroll (born 1958), also known as Alison Carroll, Alison Milyika Carroll, or "Windlass" Carroll, is an Aboriginal Australian artist. She is also a community leader on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia.

Life
Milyika was born in 1958, in Ernabella, northwest South Australia. At that time, it was a Presbyterian mission for Aboriginal people. After finishing primary school here, she went to high school in Alice Springs, at Saint Philips College and Yirara College. She moved back to Ernabella after finishing school. She briefly worked at the community's craft centre, making hand-painted bookmarks and gift cards. She also learned to use batik methods, which had been introduced to the community in 1971.

After about one or two years of working at the craft centre, Carroll decided to become a health worker. She did her training in Adelaide, and then went back to Ernabella to work in the clinic. She still worked at the craft centre sometimes, learning under her mother.

Carroll is married to Pepai Carroll, and they have five children.

Community work
Carroll has been involved in the administration of Ernabella Arts for several years. She served as its chairperson from 2001 to 2003, as its manager from 2004 to 2007, and then as chairperson again from 2007 to 2010. She was also the chairperson of Aṉanguku Arts and Culture Aboriginal Corporation from 2004 to 2006, and then became its director. Aṉanguku Arts is the organisation that coordinates and supports development of the art economy on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands. Her husband Pepai has also served as the organisation's chairman.

In April 2008, Carroll was chosen to attend the Australia 2020 Summit in Canberra, where she and Makinti Minutjukur represented the APY communities. She has since been involved in school administration in Ernabella, including serving as the chairwoman of the Governing Council of Ernabella Aṉangu School since 2011.

Artwork
Carroll is known for painting, printmaking, batik, ceramic and textile works. She uses several printmaking methods, including lithographs, etchings and screen printing. Her painted designs are called , which are designs and symbols that mean something to her. They represent her identity and her own view of the world, and are associated with her family's Dreaming legends. The designs are abstract, and come from ancient ceremonial designs (historically painted on the body or rock).

Carroll has had her works held in many public and private galleries both in Australia and other countries. Example of her batik works are held in the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, the State Library of South Australia in Adelaide, and the British Museum. The National Museum of Australia and the National Gallery of Australia both contain multiple examples of Carroll's printings, etchings, batik works, and textile paintings.

One of her earliest works, a painting done on paper, was chosen as one of the finalists for the first National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 1984. In 2011, Carroll's uncle, Dickie Minyintiri, became one of the oldest people to win the award.

Recognition
Carroll won the Premier’s Award for Lifetime Achievement at the South Australian Ruby Awards in 2018.

The Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation (RIRRC) was awarded a gold medal in the Solid Waste Association of North America’s (SWANA) 2013 Excellence Awards for their retrofitted Materials Recycling Facility Tuesday in Long Beach, Calif. The award was for the national competition in the Recycling Systems category and the quasi-public organization was honored at SWANA’s WASTECON conference.

“It means a lot to us,” said RIRRC Executive Director Michael OConnell, adding that SWANA is the premiere association in the country and this is considered the best award one can receive. “It’s not a small task. We’re really happy about it.”

According to a press release from SWANA, awards recognize “outstanding solid waste programs and facilities that advance the practice of environmentally and economically sound solid waste management through their commitment to utilizing effective technologies and processes in system design and operations, advancing worker and community health and safety, and implementing successful public education and out reach programs.” In order to win awards, programs must also be fiscally and environmentally responsible.

RIRRC entered the competition in May, providing great detail about their new facility. Beginning in fall 2011, the process began to transition the facility from a dual stream system to “a highly automated and efficient 50 tons per hour single stream facility.”

“It allows us to separate plastics we couldn’t separate before,” said OConnell about the new facility, which was completed in spring 2012 and just finished it’s first fiscal year of operation.

OConnell believes they won the award because it was a large task to complete, they remained operational during the retrofitting and the project was completed with no issue.

“I’ve never seen something so complex turn on and be able to work properly,” said OConnell about the retrofitting of the facility. “We were not only able to fund this internally without taxpayers funding, we were also on time, on budget and meeting all of the special requirements.”

OConnell also said the size of the Johnston-based operation could play a part in its success.

“We’re a big facility,” said OConnell, adding he believes the RIRRC facility is one of the biggest in the world, processing almost 100,000 tons of materials each year. The property is 1,100 acres and the facility serves nearly 1.05 million Rhode Islanders.

The retrofitting of the 77,260-square-foot Materials Recycling Facility was also cost-effective. An evaluation was completed prior to the transition to determine what equipment could be re-purposed, which reduced the cost and maximized the investment. OConnell said the $16.9 million cost of the project was funded internally.

“We had been saving and planning for a number of years,” said OConnell.

According to their application, by refitting the existing building and not starting from the ground up, the proposed cost was cut in half.

OConnell also pointed out that the single stream system has proven incredibly successful and the tonnage went up 11 percent in FY13 after the system became operational. According to their application to SWANA, baled product shipments have increased by 15 percent because of more materials coming in, lower loss of recyclable to residue and continuous inbound tonnage increases.

“It’s considered easier for consumers because they don’t have to separate [recyclables]. It’s also easier for businesses because they only need one dumpster,” said OConnell. “The message to the consumer is to make it simple.”

He added that the simplicity of using a single stream system would lead to continuous increases in recycling across the state over the years.

“This is really the way everyone’s been going,” said OConnell of the single stream system.

OConnell added that communities that have made the move over to the automated system with the larger receptacles have seen an increase of 15 to 20 percent in recycled materials.

The application also states that the facility has seen improved performance in all areas including improved product quality, operational efficiency, reliability, diversion and safety.

Updates were also made to the education center to reflect the transition to the new system. One feature is a virtual tour featuring 12 flat screen monitors with videos detailing the steps in the recycling process.

“I think if you came in and saw it, it would speak for itself,” said OConnell.

Former midfielder Mohamed Aboutrika was voted the greatest player in Egyptian history in a FIFA poll, overcoming the likes of Mohamed Salah, Mahmoud Al-Khateeb, and Hossam Hassan.. Aboutrika topped the poll with a sweeping 56 percent, followed by Salah taking 36 percent of the votes. Khateeb gathered 6 percent of the votes, while Hassan took 2 percent.. Aboutrika, now retired, led Egypt’s national team for nearly a decade and is widely considered to be the most admired Egyptian player in his generation.. During his career, Aboutrika plates for Al-Ahly, and led the team to five CAF Champions League trophies. The club also won the Egyptian League five times and the Egyptian Cup twice with him on the team.. Aboutrika is currently resides in Qatar. He was accused in 2017 of funding the banned Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt’s government designated as a ‘terrorist’ organization.. In 2015, a government committee which was established to seize and manage Brotherhood properties and funds froze Aboutrika’s assets.

There are many situations in which businesses request information from suppliers, customers and potential customers, for example to obtain contact details, to understand customer requirements to enable targeted marketing, or to obtain feedback on existing services so that improvements can be made. Electronic forms may be completed and sent on-line to a business when ordering products and services, or to provide requested information. There are problems associated with the use of electronic forms, and each of the other known ways of obtaining requested information also has problems.
A service provider or product manufacturer may publish an order form on their Web site to enable customers to order products and services. Hyperlinks to the order form may be provided within other Web pages, or the URL for accessing the form may be published in a magazine or newspaper. A potential customer can navigate to the location of the form on the Web and then fill in the form on-line or download the form over the network for later completion. A reliable network connection is necessary for accessing and submitting on-line forms. Users of bandwidth-limited wireless devices are often reluctant to spend time navigating through a Web site to find the appropriate form, and so any requirement to locate a form via a network reduces the number of people completing the form. If storage space is limited, the device user may also be reluctant to save multiple forms onto their device. Any requirement for users to manually enter long URLs introduces the likelihood of errors.
Another option is for a corporation to transmit a form to their customers' mobile telephones or other devices when requesting information. A number of projects have proposed specifications and languages for Web-based forms (such as the W3C's XForms, the Extensible Forms Description Language (XFDL), the Form Automation Markup Language (FAML) and Wireless Markup Language (WML) forms) and some are compatible with low-bandwidth devices with a small user interface. Forms have the advantage of controlling the format in which data is entered and hence limiting the scope for user errors when entering data.
However, a broadcast solution has the problem that the form may be received correctly only by a subset of the target audience (such as, in the case of WML, users of WAP-compliant telephones that are currently switched on and accessible via the network). Even if correctly received, the recipients may still choose not to save the forms onto their devices, for example because the recipient has no interest in the form at the time they receive it, and possibly also because of concerns about wasting storage or unwillingness to incur the costs and delays of communicating with a WAP server. If a form is imposed on a mobile device user at a time when it is not convenient to complete the form, there is a high likelihood that the form will be deleted. There is a need for data collection methods which are very convenient for end users to increase the proportion of end users willing to participate.
Some corporations have attempted to collect information from potential customers via Short Message Service (SMS) text messaging. SMS messaging has the advantages of convenience and low cost, and the possibility of asynchronous message delivery by telecommunication network providers gives scalability and a degree of reliability of communications. A corporation running a competition or advertisement may invite competitors to submit entries by text messaging for these reasons, or a corporation may wish to target advertisements at young people (who often use text messaging extensively). For example, television broadcasting corporations sometimes invite viewers to use SMS messaging to vote on the outcome of a program, hoping to boost ratings by encouraging a sense of audience participation.
However, errors often arise because text messaging users fail to comply with the data format requirements of the data requester. A corporation may require responses from its customers in a particular format to enable accurate automated addition of responses to a database, and so the corporation may provide format instructions. For example, spaces between a customer's answers and commas between sections of the customer's address may be treated as delimiters within a transmitted data string that are used to control how the information within a response is entered into the corporation's database. A great many users fail to follow the instructions correctly and either enter their information incorrectly or give up because of the effort involved. These issues, and the limited screen size of many mobile devices, mean that the information requester may not solve the problem by publishing detailed instructions.
Let us assume that a corporation requires address details to be entered in a format such as ‘number street name’, ‘district’, ‘city’, ‘postcode’ (or zip code), ‘country’, to enable the information to be automatically entered into the correct database fields. However, the address “21 Belvue Road, Chariton, Southampton, SO19 3YT, UK” is entered by a user as “21, Belvue Road, Chariton, Southampton SO19 3YT, UK”. In the absence of address validation and automatic correction, the address may be interpreted as follows:
‘number and street name’ = ‘21’‘district’ = ‘Belvue Road’‘city’ = ‘Charlton’‘postcode’ = ERROR‘country’ = ‘UK’
The example shows how minor errors in data entry can result in database errors or input data being rejected as invalid. In this example, the ERROR message appears if ‘Southampton SO19 3YT’ is recognized as an invalid post code but is not automatically corrected. This example is representative of a very common problem for corporations wishing to obtain information via text messaging. The combination of formatting errors and users' reluctance to invest much time and effort typically results in a much smaller number of valid responses than the data-requesting corporation hoped for.

Weekend reading: a State of Politics article about proposed legislation for a WPA-style jobs program in New York State. Jeremy Cohan recently sent along a short article from State of Politics about a recent bill introduced by New York State Assemblywoman Pat Fahy, aimed at helping Millennials laid off from their jobs due to the COVID-19 shutdown. The legislation would create a new WPA-style program that would provide employment in fields like “contact tracing, conservation and climate mitigation.” In the article, Fahy says:. “Nearly one-third of those under 35 are out of work with the majority in low-wage, retail sector, or gig-economy jobs […] Creating the WPA-PR would provide young New Yorkers with good-paying jobs in the creative economy and bolster the state’s arts and cultural institutions. A bold investment like the WPA-PR would help create and train a new state green workforce, build clean-energy infrastructure, and reinvigorate the promise of the American Dream in NY.”.

Price Adjustment within a Framework of Symmetric Oligopoly. An Analysis of Pricing in 380 U.S. Manufacturing Industries 1958-71. AbstractThis paper is concerned with the generation and testing of predictions on price adjustment from a model of symmetric oligopoly. Two types of industry demand regimes are considered, linear and iso-elastic. It is shown that these can be distinguished by a simple test, and linear demand is given strong support. It is then shown that the industry conjectural variation may be treated as a function whose properties can be established by non-linear estimation of the price adjustment 253..

RECALL: Chunky Monkey Among Two Flavors With Possible Allergen. A consumer goods company based in London has issued a U.S. recall of two types of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream.. Unilever has recalled Ben & Jerry's Coconut Seven Layer Bar and Chunky Monkey Ice Cream flavors as of April 15, according to an announcement on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration website. The recall is of the 2.4 gallon tubs of the Coconut Seven Layer Bar, and the pint-sized containers of Chunky Monkey.. The decision to pull the products was based on the discovery of potentially undeclared tree nuts on the packaging, which could potentially result in a life-threatening allergic reaction. UPC codes, and other specific information pertaining to the items recalled, can be found on the FDA website.. No reports of illnesses as of yet have been made public. The recalled ice cream brands are commonly found in stores across the country. For more information on the Ben & Jerry's recall, consumers can call 833-236-1237.

Electrical connections between an integrated circuit device formed at one substrate and another integrated circuit device formed at a different substrate can be achieved by stacking one of the integrated circuit devices on top of the other backside-to-frontside to create a ledge at the bottom device. When stacked in this manner, wire bonds can be formed between interconnects at the ledge of the bottom integrated circuit device to interconnects at the top integrated circuit device or at an underlying substrate, such as a package substrate. Alternatively, direct face-to-face flip-chip bonding between two integrated circuit devices can be achieved by forming conductive bumps at one of the devices, and bonding the devices together face-to-face. In yet another embodiment, direct back-to-front bonding between two integrated circuits can be achieved by forming through-wafer vias that include conductive bumps at the back-side of one of the devices and bonding the devices back-to-front. Current practices of forming through-wafer vias include forming a metal plug surrounded by an insulating layer through the substrate of the integrated circuit, whereby the insulating layer isolates the metal plug from the surrounding semiconductor substrate material. During operation a signal is provided between the backside of the integrated circuit's substrate to a frontside of the substrate through the metal plug. Forming metal through-wafer vias such as these can require a number of difficult processes, and create material miss-match stresses that can damage a single crystal substrate, especially when elevated temperature are used subsequent to formation of device structures at the frontside of the integrated circuit. Therefore, a device and method overcoming these issues would be useful.

Intensive cytosine arabinoside therapy in small cell carcinoma of the lung.
Cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) 100 mg/m2/d was given by continuous infusion to patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung in two simultaneous studies. In a first study, 10 patients who had failed prior therapy were treated with Ara-C alone. No responses were seen in these heavily pretreated patients and toxicity was severe. In a second study, Ara-C was added to the known active combination of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and vincristine (CAV) in 25 patients with extensive-stage small cell carcinoma with no prior treatment. Despite a clinical response rate of 52% (28% complete remissions, 24% partial remissions), the median survival was 169 days. This aggressive therapy approach produced substantial toxicity and no therapeutic benefit over previous regimens. Continuous infusion Ara-C (100 mg/m2/d X 3 days) used alone, or combined with CAV is not a useful agent for cell carcinoma of the lung.

The etiology of arthrogryposis (multiple congenital contracture).
In laboratory animals, prenatal contractures have been induced by viruses, neuromuscular blocking agents, toxins, insecticides, hyperthermia, and limb immobilization. In agricultural animals, prenatal contractures are related to pregnant animals foraging on plants containing toxic alkaloids. Epizootics of prenatal contractures in cattle have been related to Akabane viral infections, which can now be prevented by vaccination. Human arthrogryposis (multiple congenital contracture) may occur in any synovial joint in a large variety of combinations. Several lethal syndromes commonly associated with prenatal contractures (Pena Shokeir 1 and 11, Potter's) provide supportive evidence for the following concept of prenatal contracture etiology. Evidence is provided that indicates that the following multiple etiologic factors are related to production of human arthrogryposis: mutagenic agents, mitotic abnormalities, toxic chemicals or drugs, hyperthermia, neuromuscular blocking agents, and mechanical immobilization. These multiple factors mediate their effect via the central nervous system (craniospinal motor neuraxis), motor end-plates, or by primary degeneration of muscle. The resultant effect is loss of muscle mass with imbalance of muscle power at the joints, which provokes a collagenic response (Law of the Connective Tissue). The collagenic response consists of partial replacement of muscle volume and collagenous thickening of the joint capsules. The latter process leads to joint fixation.

Bhattacharya, even when he was most powerful, chose to stay out of the spotlight and had almost managed a successful disappearing act.

Before Robert Vadra, there was Ranjan Bhattacharya, the foster son-in-law of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who reportedly pulled strings from the background while his father-in-law was Prime Minister and managed to evade attention, until Arvind Kejriwal chose to target famous son-in-laws.

Bhattacharya isn't easily described, primarily because he chose to actively shun the spotlight. Married to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's foster-daughter, Namita, Bhattacharya even while occupying his seat of power in 7 Race Course Road maintained a low profile at all times, including while on political tours, something Vadra has found it more difficult to adhere to.

"Robert's flamboyance, his Page 3 habits, put him in the firing line of those gunning for the Gandhi family. Ranjan did not exist for Vajpayee enemies," a political observer was quoted as saying in a Times of India report.

A graduate with economics honours from Delhi's Shri Ram College of Commerce, Bhattacharya reportedly met his wife while studying. He then joined the Oberoi Group and became the a general manager of the group's hotel in Srinagar, a Rediff column on Bhattacharya stated.

Bhattacharya reportedly lost both parents while he was still young and it brought him closer to his wife's family and Vajpayee, who he referred to as 'Bappaji'. His devotion was proven when he toured the nation with his father-in-law voluntarily in 1996, but was careful even then to ensure that none in the BJP could accuse him of mooching off his in-laws.

Appointed an Officer on Special Duty, while his father in law was Prime Minister, Bhattacharya stuck to the shadows but quickly became known as the man to go to in the PMO, but never over stated his power and ever affable, as the Rediff columnist noted:

His detractors complain he has a hand in every deal that goes through these days; from the Maruti settlement to Surjeet Singh Barnala's decision to not import sugar. But most concede that such allegations are part of a smear campaign against his father-in-law. Ranjan is more practical. Tell him this and he'll laugh and come up with three more allegations against him: 'There's also a rumour about me in some telecom scandal as well. How come you haven't heard that one?' he'll ask; and offer you some more coffee at his office in Delhi's Greater Kailash.

He could reportedly be found relaxing with ministers over a drink in the middle of the day, while his father-in-law met with foreign delegations, and at times even had a say in who would become the next finance secretary.

In his memoirs, A Lucknow Boy, former editor of Outlook Vinod Mehta spoke of how the magazine had flagged off various deals in which Bhattacharya reportedly had a more than important role to play:

Topping the list was the Rs 58,000-crore national highways project which had been moving at a frenetic pace because of the extra push being given by the PMO. The first lot of contracts had been awarded to a clutch of seven dubious Malaysian firms. The Rs 20,000-crore Reliance Hirma power project, referred to earlier, was also on Ranjan’s radar. He and the PMO were pushing the Reliance case for a counter guarantee which amounted to a gift for Reliance.

Mehta also wrote of how the PMO had decided to allow a telecom policy, allegedly pushed through by India's biggest industrial houses, which had led to ally Samata Party writing to the Prime Minister seeking to check Bhattacharya's influence.

However, Mehta soon discovered that Bhattacharya was out of bounds when Vajpayee told him in no uncertain words that Bhattacharya's conduct was as "pure as snow". It was followed by a series of IT raids on the proprieter of Outlook.

Bhattacharya's name also featured briefly during reports of the UTI scam and in the sale of government hotels, but the allegations never stuck, at least never long enough to matter, the Times report noted.

Bhattacharya quietly vanished once his father-in-law lost power and faded away from the political limelight. If it weren't for the Niira Radia tapes scandal and Kejriwal, who chose to drag him back into the spotlight, it might just have been a perfect disappearing act.

Conventional thermoplastic resins, for example, vinyl chloride resins such as polyvinyl chloride; acrylic resins such as polymethyl methacrylate; aromatic vinyl resins such as polystyrene and styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer; carbonate resins such as polycarbonate; amide resins such as Nylon 6; polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate; olefin resins such as polypropylene; and polymer alloys of those resins, for example, alloy of styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer and polycarbonate, alloy of .alpha.-methylstyrene-acrylonitrile copolymer and polyvinyl chloride and alloy of polystyrene and polyphenylene oxide are inherently low in impact resistance. In order to improve impact resistance of those resins and alloys thereof, generally there have been widely employed methods for adding, to rubber particles, graft copolymer particles obtained by graft-copolymerizing various monomers. Though the degree of improvement of impact resistance by the addition of the graft copolymer particles is remarkable, for further improving the impact resistance efficiently, there have been made many proposals of improving graft copolymer particles. The methods disclosed in those proposals are a method of lowering Tg of rubber particles (JP-A-2-1763, JP-A-8-100095), a method of regulating gel content of rubber particles, a method of matching particle size and particle size distribution of rubber particles in graft copolymer particles to those of thermoplastic matrix resin (S. Wu, Polymer Engineering and Science, 30,753 (1990)), a method of adjusting compatibility of graft copolymer particles with thermoplastic matrix resin (JP-A-2-251553), etc.
However improvement by those methods have reached their limits, and it is difficult to improve impact resistance more significantly. Also when an adding amount of graft copolymer particles is increased, there is a problem that other characteristics, for example, processability, weather resistance and economic efficiency are lowered.
Meanwhile crazing and shearing yield are an important factor on improvement of impact resistance of a thermoplastic resin. In order to cause such phenomena, stress concentration in a molded article is inevitable. For that purpose, rubber particles are added. Optimizing a size, shape and softness (Tg and degree of crosslinking of rubber) of rubber particles also has a great effect on the stress concentration, and it is anticipated that making a large cavity in the rubber particle previously has greater influence on the stress concentration ("Impact Resistance of Plastics" by Ikuo Narisawa, pp. 131, 155, published by Siguma Shuppan (1994)). However this proposal is hypothetical, and how it is realized is not disclosed.
In order to realize production of hollow graft copolymer particles, the present inventors have made various studies even with respect to different techniques which are not usually studied, and have found that when a technique for hollowing of particles which is known in the field of paints is applied, hollow graft copolymer particles can be prepared and that when such hollow graft copolymer particles are added to a thermoplastic resin, impact resistance can be further improved. Thus the present invention was completed.

The shortage of clean water in many parts of the world is a critical problem. According to the World Health Organization, 1.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water. As a direct consequence 1.6 million people die every year from diarrheal diseases (including cholera) attributable to lack of access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation and 90% of these are children under 5, mostly in developing countries.

Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability (LOHAS) describes an estimated $209 billion U.S. marketplace for goods and services focused on health, the environment, social justice, personal development and sustainable living. The consumers attracted to this market represent a sizable group in this country.

The problem of e-waste: Between the breakneck pace of technological progress and our voracious appetite for gadgets, we're accumulating piles of obsolete computers, cell phones, and other electronic junk. This stuff is hard to dispose of because it's full of many different materials and tends to contain toxins like mercury, lead, and arsenic. This junk is often shipped overseas where it's "recycled" with very little oversight and becomes an environmental and public health disaster.

Urban agriculture is the practice of cultivating, processing and distributing food in, or around a village, town or city. Social benefits that have emerged from urban agricultural practices are; better health and nutrition, increased income, employment, food security within the household, and community social life.

What would you give for someone or something to helps you find safe, healthy, and sustainable products while you shop? How about simply scanning the barcode of the product and immediately see detailed ratings for health, environment and social responsibility for more than 50,000 products and companies.

What chemicals are in your baby shampoo? Was sweatshop labor used to make your t-shirt? What products are the best, and what products should you avoid?
Increasingly, you want to know about the impacts of the products you buy. On your health. On the environment. On society. But unless you’ve got a Ph.D, it is almost impossible to find out the impacts of the products you buy. Until now…

Almost all consumer electronics (mobile phones, computers, monitors, printers, etc.) contain toxic materials such as lead, mercury, arsenic and a broad variety of other materials that pose a threat to the environment and health. The challenge is to extend device usage to end-of-life, safely mine existing eWaste for materials, and design new devices with planned reclamation using reclaimed materials where possible.

Finding a convenient, healthy snack can be difficult in workplaces and schools where fruit trees are long gone and the best on offer now comes from a vending machine stuffed with junk. In this troubled economic times, many schools are forced to shut down their cafeteria services and replace them with rows of vending machines.

In the US alone, consumers spent hundreds of billions of dollars in fast food alone. Modern consumers have an ambivalent relationship (characterized by guilt) with fast food, particularly in relation to children. This guilt is projected onto processed food, where bizarre tales of contamination and lax standards are widely believed. Trans fats which are commonly found in fast food have been shown in many tests to have a negative health effect on the body. Excessive calories are another issue with fast food. A regular meal at McDonald's consists of a Big Mac, large fries, and a large Coca-Cola drink amounting to 1430 calories

The local food movement in which sustainable food production, processing, distribution, and consumption is integrated to enhance the economic, environmental and social health of a particular place and is considered to be a part of a broader sustainability movement. Urban farming — the art of growing vegetables in cities has become increasingly trendy in recent years, led by health-conscious foodies coveting just-picked produce, as well as hipsters who dig the roll-your-own vibe.

Q:

History of the demise of Matrox from the world of 3D graphics cards

In the last century, a brand of video cards that rhymed with quality, Matrox, was very popular and the choice for professional applications and to some extent for 3D gaming.
The benefits of upgrading your computer with a Matrox Millenium were instantly visible, a very fast desktop on Windows, better-balanced colors, custom drivers for professional applications such as AutoCAD and so on.
At the mid-90s, 3D cards were all the rage and they managed to release an affordable, yet effective card for gaming, the Matrox Mystique.
Sometime after, they released (what I think) their best range of cards: the Matrox G200, followed by the Matrox G400. These back then were a popular choice as out of the box they provided dual screen, TV output, and accelerated video.
Back then, NVidia and ATI did exist but weren't as ubiquitous as they are now. Today, Matrox is mostly to be found in niche markets such as 'many displays' cards, the typical product you'll find used by public places with many displays such as airports
What happened back then that such a popular brand vanished over time?

A:

The 3DFX Voodoo graphics chip (1996) was superior to anything else at the time for 3D. The Matrox Mystique (1996) was a fine card, good 3D and 2D but not as good as the Voodoo for 3D (the Voodoo lacked 2D).
Later, the Nvidia RIVA 128 (1997) and ATI 3D Rage Pro (1997) competed with the Voodoo line, and Matrox was left behind.
The Millennium G400 (1999) was another fine card, ahead of its time with Environment Mapped Bump Mapping (EMBM) but at the time this feature was not well supported by the industry. The ATI Radeon 7200 (2000), Nvidia GeForce 2 GTS (2000), and 3dfx Voodoo 5 (2000) arrived later with the same feature but better performance and industry support.
The ultimate demise of Matrox in the consumer market came with the short-lived Parhelia (2002):

As had happened with previous Matrox products, the Parhelia was
  released just before competing companies released cards that
  completely outperformed it. In this case it was the ATI Radeon 9700,
  released only a few months later. The Parhelia remained a niche
  product, and was Matrox's last major effort to sell into the consumer
  market.

A:

I think 3D (read: gaming) just wasn't their target market.
The thing about Matrox cards was that they were always a bit more expensive, targeted at workstations and "high reliability" environments such as control rooms, security monitoring, emergency dispatch, power grid, traffic and light control, process automation and medical sector. Really any place that has a "reliability component" which requires a lengthy testing and validation process and where components can't fail.
AMD/ATi and nVidia didn't target this market in their 3D components because history has shown that they had no problem releasing cards that sounded like a vacuum cleaner and needed a ridiculously powered power supply. Matrox couldn't release these kinds of things and maintain their standing for reliability. It isn't to say that Matrox couldn't have (it could possible cheapen their brand image) nor is it to say that AMD/ATi and nVidia didn't release more reliable cards (they have), but the real cutting edge 3D gaming stuff is pushing the limits without regard for failure.
As for the turning point in the late 90's for "king of the hill" 3D GPUs, the thing that really separated the cards at the time was color depth and various 3D features (filtering, etc.). 3Dfx was the top, but ATi and nVidia ate their lunch simply by offering more features. I recall that reviews (e.g. Maximum PC) would state how Unreal looked so much better with the nVidia Riva TNT's 32-bit color in comparison to 3Dfx's 16-bit.
For what it's worth, the problem with 3Dfx and a bit of its downfall was that the TNT was a similar cost all-in-one solution which had equivalent performance to the 3Dfx Voodoo2. Yes, the Voodoo3 was an answer to that as a faster all-in-one card, but the problem is that it used the same chipset as the older Voodoo2. It competed on performance, but there were no new features. I don't recall enough of 3Dfx's history, but it might simply be when they started addressing color depth and other things, they had already lost the race. It is possible that they had been focusing too much their work with Sega as they were supposed to be the chipset for the Dreamcast, but that deal fell through as Sega went with NEC's PowerVR in the end.

This is a handmade card showing the illusion of an antique golden-silver disk with Lapis Lazuli inlays. There are four boars, many swans, and 4 hidden faces to discover. Inside the card there is a full colour inlay and an extra inlay with the following text: My Celtic Art Project. This is my contribution to my ‘Who are the Celts?’ course at Oxford Department for Continuing Education, week 5 ‘Make your Own Celtic Art’ (2017). At the end of a demanding week of studying participants were challenged to make their own Celtic art. I used Golden/Silver ink-pens, an ordinary Bic blue pen, art paper, a protector, and many rulers to create an illusion of a golden plate decorated with silver and Lapis Lazuli boars. Notice the boars, hidden faces, and many swans.. © by Paula Kuitenbrouwer. This engaging card comes in protective cellophane, a name card, and a seal sticker. All in all this is an art project card that will entertain its (new) owner and it leaves plenty of room for a handwritten text.

Egara Tenjin Shrine

, is a Shinto shrine in Kamakura. Having been founded according to legend by an unknown priest in 1104, it is one of the few extant religious institutions in the area to predate the advent of Minamoto no Yoritomo, who arrived here in 1181. Like all other Tenjin shrines in Japan, it enshrines the spirit of famous scholar and politician Sugawara no Michizane under the name Tenjin. For this reason, the kami is believed to be a protector of intellectual pursuits.

Having been unjustly sent into exile, where he died, Michizane was deified and enshrined to pacify his soul, which was believed to be angry as a consequence. Numerous calamities that followed his death validated this belief.

The shrine, described as "in bad shape" a century ago by Iso Mutsu,<ref>Iso Mutsu. Kamakura: Fact and Legend', Tuttle Publishing (1995/06) </ref> has been completely rebuilt and consists of an oratory (haiden) and of a sacrarium (honden''). Both are painted in the traditional Shinto vermilion color.

Hydraulic Oil Cleanliness: A Key to N/C Machine Maintenance

High uptime on numerical control (N/C) machining centers is the result of correcting any condition that may ultimately lead to some component failure. This requires an intimate knowledge of the machine hydraulic system and components, and that rare sense of what is right (or wrong) in the entire operation of a machine. A measurement of oil cleanliness can be most helpful.

A remarkable increase of N/C machines in manufacturing industries presents a challenge to develop personnel for proper care of these installations. Development of this skill in machine maintenance is the users' achievement.

Present day machines, with improved components and hydraulic systems, are less sensitive to hydraulic problems. Several years of experience has provided technical knowledge in the art. This information can be passed on by a machine builder to a user, or from one user to another, in symposiums such as this.

Nevio Marasović

Nevio Marasović (born 7 July  1983) is a Croatian film director and screenwriter. He is also a commercial director.

Biography

Film career 

Made his first feature film called The Computer Repairment at the age of sixteen.

Graduated film directing at the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Zagreb.
In 2005 he made a ghost commercial “Durex Lunch” which won numerous awards at different advertising festivals. “Lunch” also became an internet meme in the following years.

In 2010 Marasović wrote and directed his feature film The Show Must Go On, set in near-future Zagreb, seven years after the accession of Croatia to the EU, in which there are two depictions - one of the outside world, i.e. the third world war between the EU and unnamed countries, and the other of housemates in a Big Brother-like TV reality show, who are unaware that during their stay in the house a world war has started and who the main character, the producer of the show, decides not to inform, in order to give the viewers a view of the carefree world that once existed before the war broke out.

The Show Must Go On received Golden Arena for Best Screenplay, Golden Arena for the Best Special Effects, Best Newcomer award and the Critic’s Choice Movie of the Year award at the Pula Film Festival, Croatia’s national film festival.

The same year Marasović made a TV comedy show called Instruktor for Croatia's RTL television.
Along with a Croatian actor Stjepan Perić, Marasović was Instruktor'''s author and writer.

Browse through DLA Piper’s extensive guide to data regulations and enforcement around the world and it’s clear that the United States stands out compared with more robust protections in places like Canada and Europe. (Elsewhere, protections are lesser or nonexistent.) Many European countries have central agencies dedicated to data protection. In France, individuals must give their consent before a data broker can distribute his or her data. In the United Kingdom, websites have to notify visitors of data-tracking software. Many European countries require data brokers to give individuals the opportunity to review their data profiles, and to show them how to access, change, remove, or otherwise object to the data that has been collected.

There is some dissonance to the fact that data protections in the U.S. are so slim compared with other regulations in other nations. Culturally, Americans prize the right to privacy. And there are U.S. sectors, like health care, where protecting personal data is paramount. But Americans don't even know which pieces of their personal data is swirling around out there. Your name, age, past addresses, political party enrollment, whether you own a home—sure, you might expect that kind of stuff is to be shared by marketers and others who deal in data. But data brokers specialize in inference, too, so they can figure out all kinds of super-specific details about who you are and how you live.

"For example, a data broker might infer that an individual with a boating license has an interest in boating, that a consumer has a technology interest based on the purchase of a Wired magazine subscription, or that a consumer who has bought two Ford cars has loyalty to that brand," wrote the Federal Trade Commission in a report on Big Data this week.

The FTC has been pushing for Congress to do something about free wheeling data brokers for the better part of the last decade. All this data collection is happening without consumer consent, and some the profiling that seems innocuous is actually harmful, the commission argues.

One person profiled as low-income might be inundated with sub-prime mortgage offers. Another person profiled as a motorcyclist might be flagged by insurance companies for higher rates. The categories into which consumers are sorted are incredibly detailed, and they’re based on a mix of government data (like the political donations you made), publicly available data (like the relationship status on your Facebook profile), and commercial data (like how Aquafresh Extreme Clean is your favorite brand of toothpaste, a nugget of data that’s linked to you because you swiped your CVS rewards card before paying).

Big data knows your net worth. It knows that you have a dog. It knows when you’re most likely to use a coupon. It knows your favorite brand of detergent. It knows your dress size. It knows about your last speeding ticket, and when you got the oil changed. It knows you have a hunting license. It knows whether you're pregnant—and often before you have a chance to share the news. The New York Times in 2012 told the alarming story of a teenager whose father angrily complained to Target for sending his young daughter promotional mailings for cribs and baby clothes. It later turned out the girl was pregnant, just as her data profile predicted. She simply hadn’t told her parents yet.

Advanced retinoblastoma in Malaysian children.
Twenty children with retinoblastoma are reviewed who were treated at the University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur over a 10-year-period. They constitute 6.6% of childhood malignancies and without exception all presented with advanced disease. Hereditary cases were notably absent in the the series probably because past cases have almost invariably succumbed without an opportunity to transmit the gene. With enucleation and radiotherapy six of the patients have survived from 2 to 12 years. The addition of vincristine and cyclophosphamide has not been associated with improved survival.

DavolView In iTunes. To preview a song, mouse over the title and click Play. Open iTunes to buy and download music.. Biography. New age composer/keyboardist Davol had an early interest in music, receiving classical piano training as a child and studying jazz and classical harpsichord in college. Electronic music also interested him, and Davol began writing and recording his own pieces as a hobby while he studied microbiology. Some of the tapes he passed out to friends made their way to Silver Wave Records, who offered Davol a recording contract. In 1989, he released his debut album, Mystic Waves, and also received his Ph.D. in microbiology. Though he continued to write and record music, including his 1992 album The Nature of the Beast, Davol worked as a medical researcher until 1996, when he began writing music for multimedia along with his new age works. His fourth album, Open Book, was released in 1999. ~ Heather Phares

Survivance Among Social Impact Games. AbstractStudying social impact games can result in many outcomes, such as awareness or action around a social issue. Research can help inform best practices for the design process, strategies for reaching players, game mechanics for aligning with social impact outcomes, and methods for identifying the impact of the game on players and the wider community. One such research project is Survivance ()—a social impact game that addresses healing from intergenerational historical trauma experienced by Indigenous communities. Survivance was designed collaboratively with Indigenous game designer/researcher Elizabeth LaPensée and the non-profit organization Wisdom of the Elders, Inc. This paper seeks to contextualize the area of social impact games within the Games for Change movement, compare perspectives on social impact games, and create connections and comparisons with Survivance..

Elsas and Lennon on September 28, 1974. Today marks the 30th anniversary etched in the minds of Beatles fans around the world. John Lennon was murdered outside of his apartment building, The Dakota, overlooking Central Park.. “There was no precedent to any of this,” Veteran New York DJ Dennis Elsas reflects. “The assassination of a rock star, that was totally new.”. Elsas, six years earlier, had what many consider the definitive radio interview with Lennon. Elsas, working at the time for WNEW-FM, spoke with Lennon for two hours that Saturday afternoon. You can hear portions of that famous interview on Elsas’ website.. The legendary DJ for more than a decade has been an afternoon fixture at Fordham University’s WFUV (90.7 FM). He recalls for FishbowlNY that fateful night when the WNEW on-air staff and listeners mourned as one for the loss of the music and goodwill giant.

The industry is abuzz because of Oracle’s tightening on licensing for Sun products. (Read the press release from Oracle about their Sun acquisition.) Indeed, several of our own clients are pretty upset about the heavy-handed push by Oracle to force users of Sun products into expensive license purchases, especially for those that relied heavily on Sun’s relatively open licenses on some products, such as those for Sun Directory Server (DSEE) and Sun OpenSSO.. Novell has made a great move: If you own licenses for Sun software, such as Sun IM, you can swap those licenses, for free, for Novell licenses. All you pay is maintenance.. Smart move.. The real fear for many of our clients, and for you in the field, is not just the current upfront costs, but the long-term costs associated with being aligned with Oracle products.. Has Oracle pretty much destroyed the value of Sun? And are they destroying the market they acquired with the Sun purchase with heavy handed tactics?

Effect of anti-CD4 antibody treatment on inflammatory arthritis in MRL-lpr/lpr mice.
MRL-lpr/lpr mice develop an inflammatory arthritis in association with other manifestations of autoimmunity. Although a variety of immune cell disturbances have been described in these mice, the relationship of these abnormalities to the pathogenesis of arthritis has not yet been determined; the role of T cells is especially unclear since synovial hypertrophy and joint erosions have been noted in some studies in the absence of a significant T cell infiltrate. Therefore, to determine if T cells are required for arthritis in MRL-lpr/lpr mice, we evaluated the effects of prolonged treatment with a monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody. Knee joints from treated mice had markedly reduced arthritis compared to saline-treated control animals as measured by the degree of synovial hypertrophy and inflammation. Nephritis in these mice was concomitantly reduced. In contrast, rheumatoid factor levels were not affected by CD4+ cell depletion, despite significant effects on anti-DNA. These results indicate that in MRL-lpr/lpr mice anti-CD4 therapy can inhibit arthritis, suggesting an important role of T cells in the pathogenesis of this lesion.

A study to examine the attitudes, knowledge, and utilization of CAM by primary care professional in West Texas.
This study examined the attitudes, knowledge, and utilization of CAM among primary care providers at two campuses of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC). A cross-sectional study design and a convenient sampling method were used. This study employed the questionnaire adapted from the Wahner-Roedler's study to survey participants in TTUHSC. Primary survey collection was conducted at the two campuses where all Family Medicine healthcare professionals were recruited. We measured participants' knowledge of, their familiarity and experience with, their attitudes towards and utilization of CAM. Of the 69 respondents, more than half (56.5%) were female and younger than 36 years. Overall, our study revealed a positive attitude towards CAM. More than 60% of the providers would like to refer a patient to a CAM practitioner and about 75% of them believed that incorporation of CAM therapies into the practice would have a positive impact. Providers were most familiar with and felt most comfortable counseling their patients about massage therapy and St. John's Wort among all CAM modalities. About 70% of the participants believed that the institution should offer proven CAM therapies to patients. This study provides some preliminary findings that may lead to further exploration of healthcare professional's attitudes towards CAM.

Estrogen replacement has been found to reduce the risk of heart disease by as much as 50% in postmenopausal females. The mechanism of action of this cardioprotective effect of estrogen, however, is not clear. The use of replacement hormones has recently been associated with the enhancement of endogenous fibrinolytic potential, i.e., blood thinning factors. This enhanced fibrinolytic potential may contribute to the inverse relation between hormonal replacement and coronary heart disease. These effects are consistent whether oral estrogen monotherapy, estrogen plus progesterone or transdermal estradermal estradiol is administered. For study purposes, we will randomize each woman to take one month of either oral or transdermal estrogen or placebo. The primary goal is to evaluate the effects of estrogen on blood thinning and clotting factors (i.e.tPA antigen, PAI-1 antigen D-dimer, von Willebrand factor, and fibrinogen). Our second goal will be to assess the effects of using 2 different routes of hormonal replacement (oral and transdermal estrogen) on fibrinolytic and hemostatic potential in postmenopausal women. The third goal is to determine the fibrinogen phenotype and acute phase reactants that are found after estrogen therapy.

Primaquine: its effect on cellular immune response of normal rhesus monkeys.
The effect of primaquine on the cellular immune responses (lymphocyte subpopulations and their proliferative responses with PHA, Con-A and LPS, and phagocytosis by monocytes) of normal rhesus monkeys was studied under both in-vivo and in-vitro conditions. When the lymphocytes and monocytes from normal animals were treated in-vitro with primaquine, at concentration normally attainable during therapy, a significant inhibition in blastogenic response of lymphocytes and phagocytic capacity of monocytes was noticed after 4 hours of treatment. In contrast, the in-vivo effect of primaquine treatment on these cells was innocuous. From this study it is clear that the primaquine does not act as an immunosuppresant and can be given safely to any type of malaria patient.

Nanofilled Resin Composite Properties and Clinical Performance: A Review.
The aim of this review was to compile recent evidence related to nanofilled resin composite materials regarding the properties and clinical performance. Special attention was given to mechanical properties, such as strength, hardness, abrasive wear, water sorption, and solubility. The clinical performance of nanocomposite materials compared with hybrid resin composites was also addressed in terms of retention and success rates, marginal adaptation, color match, and surface roughness. A search of English peer-reviewed dental literature (2003-2017) from PubMed and MEDLINE databases was conducted using the terms "nanocomposites" or "nanofilled resin composite" and "clinical evaluation." The list was screened, and 82 papers that were relevant to the objectives of this work were included in the review. Mechanical properties of nanocomposites are generally comparable to those of hybrid composites but higher than microfilled composites. Nanocomposites presented lower abrasive wear than hybrids but higher sorption values. Their clinical performance was comparable to that of hybrid composites.

Importance of a thriving agricultural sector needs to be acknowledged, says Farmers’ Union of Wales The importance of a thriving agricultural sector needs to be acknowledged, the Farmers’ Union of Wales has said. The comments were made during a farm visit by Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney Assembly Member Dawn Bowden as part of the FUW’s #FarmingMatters campaign. --> --> Rhymney Valley beef and sheep farmer Brian Bowen opened the doors to his Pencoedcae farm the Labour AM and pressed on her the importance of farming to Wales – particularly in light of uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Mr Bowen, who is the FUW’s Policy Delegate for South Wales, farms 2,000 breeding ewes and around 150 suckler cows on 1,250 acres of rented and owned land at Princetown, Tredegar, along with his father, mother and his son. --> --> Mr Bowen said: “Farm businesses, and family farms in particular, are an essential part of the economic, social, and cultural fabric of Wales. “Welsh food production sustains tens of thousands of other businesses – from upstream businesses such as feed merchants, agricultural contractors and engineers, to downstream businesses such as hauliers, processors and retailers. --> --> “Farmers are an exceptional conduit for money, so if their businesses are thriving they reinvest and this, in turn, brings wealth to second and third sector businesses and the wider rural economy.” Farmers and FUW representatives also stressed that irrespective of what trade deals are in place post-Brexit, within the UK, Welsh farmers will have to compete against their counterparts in other devolved regions. --> -->

Mr Bowen added: “It is critical that everyone understands just how much farming matters and I would like to thank the businesses who came to join us here and echoed that sentiment.

“Following the downturn in agriculture over recent times and across almost all sectors, it is critical that we acknowledge the importance of a thriving agricultural sector on the economy – both locally and much further afield.”

According to the FUW, around 60,000 people are employed on farm holdings in Wales, in addition to the thousands employed in businesses reliant on agriculture.

“The wider contributions to our economy are also well documented, for example, in terms of tourism, while agriculture has been acknowledged as the single most significant contributor to an estimated £1.9 billion worth of wildlife based activity in Wales per annum (Mabis, 2007), the Welsh countryside, managed by farmers, provides the backdrop for the tourism industry worth over £2.5 Billion,” said Mr Bowen.

A variety of local businesses and common land associations also attended the visit. These included John Richards of The Prince of Wales pub, Price Farm Supplies, T Alun Jones Machinery, Neil Davies of PMR, Bowketts Feeds, Rees Agri, Clee Tompkinson and Francis Estate Agents, Land Agent Chris Smith, Llangynidr Commons Secretary Colin Greeves, and Merthyr Gelligaer Commons Chairman Huw Williams.

Dawn Bowden, Welsh Labour Assembly Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney said: “I am grateful to the FUW for inviting me to Pencoedcae Farm to meet with farmers and representatives of local business which are heavily reliant on farming.

“It was helpful to hear at first hand the challenges facing the farming industry, particularly in the context of the many uncertainties surrounding Brexit. The discussions brought home in very clear terms that “farming matters”, and I look forward to working with organisations like the FUW, alongside farmers and businesses in my constituency as we face the challenges ahead.”

The gowns were an interpretation of a garden whose trellised gates were placed along the model form and cinched around the waist. Murad worked lampshade skirts into flirty cocktail dresses and grand evening gowns, all lavishly embroidered to evoke garden lattices and flowers. The palette was dominated by powdery pastels in sugared almond shades.. One of the more whimsical and seductive looks was a flowing greige chiffon gown with an embroidered top and matching cape sparkling with silver crystals.

Attachment to Physical Media

If you browse a web design gallery or two you’ll notice a pattern—something that the design of my own site shares as well. The visuals of many sites recreate physical media. This is done by using paper textures for backgrounds, grungy or handwritten fonts, paper edges, wrapping labels, paint strokes, cardboard textures and so on. Even though the design is that of a website, which only exists in the digital world, the designer chooses to utilize familiar visuals of the physical realm.

This is a trend that appears to be growing. Look around on CSS galleries and you’ll see a lot of such techniques in use. Websites are starting to feel like they’re made out of paper, with painted headers and printed letters. The inspiration behind this trend is clear. The physical media looks and feels good, and we’re all familiar with it. It’s comforting and pleasing to see the nuances of that media on the screen.

But…I’m not convinced that this trend is a right direction for web design. You see, while the trend is aesthetically pleasing, the idea behind it closes off some great opportunities for the designer.

By recreating the physical media, you’re not only recreating something that already exists—and so is not new or innovative—you’re setting limits on your own creativity, limits imposed by an older media. The computer screen is free from the many restrictions of paper. There is no limit to what color you want to use or how thin a line you wish to depict (limited only by the pixel density). Things don’t have to be static on a computer screen. Sure, digital images still have their limitations, but these are not the same limitations of physical paper, and the opportunities for creating something new and unique are far greater.

When you follow the trend of recreating the physical media on the digital screen, you’re not only copying its strengths, you’re copying its flaws. The digital screen is an evolution of paper, and yet here we are going back, trying to recreate what we’ve had before. Sure, the old media like paper has character—indeed, the flaws also help make it what it is—but there is absolutely no reason why digital should lack character as well, after all, it’s up to the designer to create it.

So my thought really is this: when you find yourself working on a new design and are making it look like the physical media—paper, paint, dirt, wood, etc.— why not take a step back and ask yourself if this design can be made differently. Can you utilize the full potential of the digital medium that your website lives in by creating a look that is unique? Why submit to the limitations of an older media? Can you design something that we haven’t seen before? If you can, why not do it?

An autopsy case of bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma-associated cerebral hemorrhage.
The autopsy findings of a 30-year-old woman who died of cerebral hemorrhage induced by bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma are presented. The cerebral hemorrhage was shown on the left cerebral hemisphere widely. Her both adrenal glands were severe swelling, and their parenchyma was occupied by a dark red-brown tumorous positive for chromogranin A. The serum catecholamine and their metabolite, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) levels were markedly high. Furthermore, cardiac hypertrophy and sclerosis of the arteries of various organs had progressed, suggesting an influence of persistent endocrinal hypertension. The measurement of serum VMA level was thought to be valuable for a postmortem diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma may have excessively secreted catecholamine and subsequently caused secondary hypertension, leading to cerebral hemorrhage.

Q:

Use single ResourceDictionary for multiple themes WPF

I have a control that has a lot of themes and each theme is represented by a ResourceDictionary. The problem is that the dictionaries are almost identical and they differ only in the beggining where I have declared color brushes, for example:
<SolidColorBrush x:Key="FirstRd1" Color="#3F555555" />
<SolidColorBrush x:Key="SecondRd1" Color="#00000000" />
<SolidColorBrush x:Key="ThirdRd1" Color="#FF333333" />
<SolidColorBrush x:Key="FourthRd1" Color="#FF000000" />

These brushes (and other xaml objects for style) are used here and there on the same place, like this:
 <!-- ResourceDictionary 1 -->
 <Border CornerRadius="4"
         Margin="0, 0, 0, 0" 
         BorderThickness="1"
         BorderBrush="{StaticResource FirstRd1}">
         <!-- Some content -->
 </Border>

 <!-- ResourceDictionary 2 -->
 <Border CornerRadius="4"
         Margin="0, 0, 0, 0" 
         BorderThickness="1"
         BorderBrush="{StaticResource FirstRd2}">
         <!-- Some content -->
 </Border>

How to move the same elements with different brush like above in a single file? There are aslo other elements that do not depend on the brushes, but they are nested or have nested dependant controls. What will be the best solution in this situation, as I do not want to edit 15+ files for a single dummy change?

A:

You can merge resource dictionaries.  Declare your common stuff in one file, then for the differentiated parts make each one it's own file and merge it with the common file.

We propose something analogous, but for the much more challenging case of an image collection: We propose to automatically develop a visual vocabulary by breaking images into n × n tiles and deriving key tiles ("ViVos") "ViVos" achieve high classification accuracy (up to 83 %for a nine-class problem on feline retinal images). More importantly, qualitatively, our "ViVos" do an excellent job as "visual vocabulary terms": they have biological meaning, as corroborated by domain experts; they help spot characteristic regions of images, exactly like text vocabulary terms do for documents; and they highlight the differences between pairs of images..

Anticarcinogenic activity of quinacrine in the rat mammary gland.
Mammary carcinogenesis studies were conducted to determine the chemopreventive activity of quinacrine, an antimalarial drug which suppresses the production of arachidonic acid from phospholipid through inhibition of phospholipase A2. Beginning 1 week after a single i.v. dose of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a semi-purified diet supplemented with 0 or 75 mg quinacrine/kg diet. Quinacrine reduced cancer incidence and carcinoma multiplicity in rats administered 20 mg MNU/kg body wt, but had no inhibitory activity in rats treated with 50 mg MNU/kg. These data suggest that pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism in addition to cyclooxygenase present useful targets for mammary cancer chemoprevention. However, the chemopreventive activity of quinacrine may be limited by toxicity.

In Vertex and Vortex- A tectonics of Section, Jennifer Bloomer described the convergence of inscription and incision as the moment when a section is born. The collision of these two actions is what is conventionally called the poche, which is referred to by Bloomer as the floaters. It is described as a thin layer of liquid substance. A black dot that lies in between the brain and the object observed. To inscribe is to capture a situation by giving it a visual presence. It is a trace, a memory, a description in between the viewer and the spatial narrative beyond. To incise is to discover the unknown of the beyond. It is a physical act, a temporal state of reading and understanding. Furthermore, the notion of gravity and orientation must be considered in the making of a section. She argued that a plan divorced from gravity is a section through transparency, that "a plan is a section which demands the presence of gravity". It must be connected to the world of tension and compression..

Helix Herringbone Hat. This pattern was originally published for Club Dragonfly in November 2012. The copyright has now reverted back to me, and I am happy to share it with you. Enjoy!. I’ve always felt that the variegated yarns made by Dragonfly Fibers cry out to be worked in patterns that will pool the color families. When making a hat, the trick is to find a stitch pattern that uses up just the right amount of yarn over the number of stitches that fits your head.. The Horizontal Herringbone Stitch by Barbara Walker creates an attractive, strong horizontal motif, and eats up just the right amount of yarn to pool the colors. Using a helix knitting technique allows you to have an uninterrupted flow from beginning to end.. Circumference: 18 inches; Height: 8.5 inches from cast-on to bind off. Main color - Thisbe (solid), about 2 oz (235 yds). Contrasting color - Pyramus (variegated), about 1 oz (115 yds)

For years I have fled from a nameless figure. that first blossomed in water on an unsuspecting page,. was built unknowingly on a canvas in oils,. leaked from the tip of a chortling fountain pen,. and sketched in wandering shades of flower-grey.. A hand, taken from a poet whose lamp still burned into the night. A pair of eyes, jewels hidden behind fractured glasses. Hair, raven-black and ruffled in the direction of the wind. A nose, flawless white, from a marble sculpture in the park. Lips, pale rosy and stolen in the middle of song. A back, slightly bent beneath the burden of time. Two feet wrapped in weary brown shoes that walked the whole way.. For years I have fled from a nameless figure. For years I have learnt by heart the essence of his being. For years I have whispered in secret an unknown identity. For years I have yearned for his soundless voice.. And then, he came to me.. © 2010

I want to calculate percentage of ID having Var1 value as 8 on every day.
I have tried this but it couldn't work.
SELECT
  COUNT( ID) AS ID, 
  ((COUNT( Var1) / (COUNT( ID) )) * 100 ) AS percentage
FROM
  Table1 
WHERE Var1=8
GROUP BY
  Date(Date);

A:

I would suggest writing this as:
SELECT Date(Date), SUM(Var1 = 8) AS ID, 
       AVG(Var1 = 8) * 100 AS percentage
FROM Table1 
GROUP BY Date(Date);

This uses a MySQL shortcut that allows boolean values to be treated as numbers in a numeric context.



In something we feel is long overdue, the era of the Internet Cat is set to be immortalized in a new exhibition at the New York Museum of Moving Image, reports Racked. Titled "How Cats Took Over the Internet," the exhibition will open on August 7th. Racked also says that Internet cats "maybe-definitely don't deserve" this esteemed honor which, pshhhhh.. It sounds pretty glorious to us, with the entire space dedicated to our viral feline heros, hilarious memes, and go-to cat reaction gifs, as well as a timeline of Internet Cat history. There will also be an entire room with "cat videos played on continuous loop," which is probably where you'll be able to find us in deep, meditative thought until January 31, 2016, when the exhibition closes.. Is it too late for this nomination?

Enhancing Primary School Children's Knowledge of Online Safety and Risks with the CATZ Cooperative Cross-Age Teaching Intervention: Results from a Pilot Study.
Children are heavy users of the Internet and prior studies have shown that many of them lack a good understanding of the risks of doing so and how to avoid them. This study examined if the cross-age teaching zone (CATZ) intervention could help children acquire important knowledge of online risks and safety. It allowed older students to act as CATZ tutors to design and deliver a lesson to younger schoolmates (tutees), using content material about online risks and safety provided by adults. Students in Year 6 (mean age = 11.5 years) were randomly assigned to act as either CATZ tutors (n = 100) or age-matched controls (n = 46) and students in Year 4 (mean age = 9.5 years) acted as either CATZ tutees (n = 117) or age-matched controls (n = 28) (total N = 291). CATZ tutors, but not matched controls scored significantly higher on objective measures of knowledge of both online risks and safety, and CATZ tutees, but not matched controls did so for online safety. Effect sizes were moderate or large. CATZ was highly acceptable to participants. The results suggest that CATZ is a viable way to help school students learn about online dangers and how to avoid them.

A model for persistent infection with Epstein-Barr virus: the stealth virus of human B cells.
Most adult humans are infected benignly and for life with the herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus. EBV has been a focus of research because of its status as a candidate tumor virus for a number of lymphomas and carcinomas. In vitro EBV has the ability to establish a latent infection in proliferating B lymphoblasts. This is the only system available for studying human herpesvirus latency in culture and has been extremely useful for elucidating how EBV promotes cellular growth. However, to understand how EBV survives in the healthy host and what goes awry, leading to disease, it is essential to know how EBV establishes and maintains a persistent infection in vivo. Early studies on the mechanism of EBV persistence produced inconclusive and often contradictory results because the techniques available were crude and insensitive. Recent advances in PCR technology and the application of sophisticated cell fractionation techniques have now provided new insights into the behavior of the virus. Most dramatically it has been shown that EBV in vivo does not establish latency in a proliferating lymphoblast, but in a resting memory B cell. The contrasting behaviors of being able to establish a latent infection in proliferating B blasts and resting memory B cells can be resolved in terms of a model where EBV performs its complete life cycle in B lymphocytes. The virus achieves this not by disrupting normal B cell biology but by using it.

Effect of hesperidin on the pharmacokinetics of CPT-11 and its active metabolite SN-38 by regulating hepatic Mrp2 in rats.
The usage of irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11) chemotherapy is hindered by its dose-limiting diarrhea which appears to be associated with the intestinal exposure to SN-38, the active metabolite of CPT-11. Hesperidin, a safe and natural food ingredient flavonoid, exhibits various biological properties. Accumulated evidence showed that the regulatory effect of hesperidin on the expression of Mrp2 in the liver may be one of the critical factors controlling the biliary excretion of SN-38. This study examined the effect of hesperidin on the pharmacokinetics of CPT-11 and SN-38 as well as the regulatory effect on the hepatic expression of Mrp2. Compared with the control group, the AUC5-t was increased to 115% of CPT-11 and 122% of SN-38; the CL was decreased to 87% for CPT-11; the tissue concentration was increased in the liver, kidney and colon; and the accumulated biliary excretion was significantly decreased to 77% for CPT-11 and 76% for SN-38 in hesperidin-treated rats. Furthermore, the expression of Mrp2 in the liver was significantly decreased to 37% in the hesperidin-treated rats compared with that of the control group. These results indicate that oral administration of hesperidin significantly increased the AUC5-t and reduced the clearance of CPT-11 and SN-38, possibly by decreasing the hepatic expression of Mrp2, and thus inhibiting the biliary excretion of CPT-11 and SN-38. The results from this present study suggest that hesperidin may reduce the exposure of CPT-11 and SN-38 in the intestine by reducing the amount of biliary excretion of CPT-11 and SN-38.

NEW DELHI: A day after the government announced dismal economic growth numbers, a survey on Friday showed steady expansion of India's manufacturing sector during May, raising hopes that the industrial slowdown may stabilise in the coming months.. The HSBC manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, declined marginally to 54.8 in May from 54.9 in April. The reading for India in the widely-followed survey has stayed above 50, which separates growth from contraction, for a little over three years.

Intraventricular Meningiomas: A Series of 42 Patients at a Single Institution and Literature Review.
Primary intraventricular meningiomas (IVMs) make up 0.5%-5% of all intracranial meningiomas and represent one of the most challenging lesions in neurosurgery. Between 1990 and 2013, 42 patients (30 female, 12 male; mean age, 43.6 years) underwent resection of their IVM. The removal was performed by a posterior parietal approach in 19 of the 40 lateral ventricle tumors, and 1 third ventricle meningioma. The transcallosal approach was used for 3 meningiomas, and patients with other lesions underwent temporal (7 cases) and temporoparietal approaches (12 patients), respectively. The most common presenting signs were increased intracranial pressure (83.3%), visual impairment (78.6%) and cognitive changes (50%). Forty lesions (95.2%) arose in the lateral ventricles, and 2 (4.8%) in the third ventricle, ranging in size from 3 to 10 cm. Total removal was achieved in 39 cases and the pathology report disclosed World Health Organization grade I lesions in 41 cases. Hydrocephalus, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and cerebral edema were the postoperative complications (7.15%); 1 patient died of respiratory problems not directly related to surgery. Thirty-five patients (83.3%) showed a 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale of 5. One patient, who underwent partial resection, presented a recurrence after 1 year that remained stable until last follow-up. IVMs usually reach a large size before being diagnosed. Surgical treatment is the most suitable option and total removal should represent the main goal of the procedure. The posterior parietal transulcal approach and the temporoparietal approach are the most common surgical routes used in our series.

Cool news is Trophy trucks are coming to KOH in an invitational race for big money but the bad news is (in my opinion) they moved the UTV race to the first Sunday of the week (Feb 3). This opens up a host of questions like: When can you pre-run, when is qualifying, when is tech, when will the map get released. This will make it an easier in and out for the racers who may find it hard to be gone all week but it pushes the huge UTV class farther away from the mainstream public.

MTD Timeline. Below is a timeline for the upcoming MTD changes due to take place.. (. From 1 April 2022, almost all VAT-registered businesses will have to comply, regardless of their turnover.. What does this mean?. It means that HMRC won’t accept manual entries on VAT returns any more. All info will have to be submitted using digital links.. 2024. MTD for Income Tax Self-Assessment (ITSA). Originally due to take effect in 2023, MTD for ITSA will now launch in 2024. From that date, self-assessment taxpayers will have to make quarterly submissions to HMRC. They can alter these submissions up to the time that the final figures are due.. The idea is to make tax returns more accurate. It should also make them more manageable for you and your clients by avoiding that mad rush in the run-up to 31 January. Another upside is that MTD for ITSA will help business owners predict how much tax they’ll have to pay – and plan accordingly.

Q:

How would an MMO deal with calculating and sending packets for thousands of players every tick for a live action game?

I am working on a game and I am thinking about getting into networking. I have been programming for about 5 years and got into game development the last 2 years. I only really learn online and from books on my own time. I am planning to make a java server for Amazon AWS EC2, but I am just wondering how MMO's handle multiple players each tick.
Is it just the sheer power of servers? I am not looking for code or anything, just in general how the servers work.
Does the server just do all of the calculations for all of the players and the tens or hundreds of thousands of objects and then send and receive thousands of packets every tick? It just seems like a lot for a single computer to handle, but it is indeed a server.

A:

How work and what is the job of a server?

Your server create a socket and open a port.
The protocol for an online game is generally in UDP because it is faster.
Your server have to handle ALL the clients connections.
You can add a server who is able to log an account and redirect him into a game server (this is the case for all the big MMO).
Your server have to manage all the calculations from the Data Base: when an enemy hit another enemy, subtract a part of your money when you buy some stuffs...
So the server is the main part of an online game.

In fact, a computer is really fast for do some calculations, the most heavy part for a modern video game is the physics and graphics... Fortunately, these both parts are on the client part.
But, a server have to be strong! Not like a client because he doesn't need a big GPU, but he need a big amount of RAM/CPU (depend of the game) and he also need to stay cold.
In fact, a game server is able to handle a large amounts of connections because of the UDP protocol and because all the heavy parts of the program are on the client side. You can take a look here: Creating a Multiplayer game in python and read the part when I explain the difference between the UDP and the TCP protocol.
All the others informations about how work an MMO server are linked at the end of this topic.
Now we can try to build a server!
Firstly, do you know how to create a server?

Program or download a server for do a test (example: TeamSpeak or Mumble).
Launch him from your computer and allow his input connections from your firewall.
Log you on your modem and forward/redirect the port of your server into your computer.

For the last part, you need to do some research: Which port is used by my server and how to forward a port with my modem (each modem is different).
Now you can try to log you into your server. But...!
Your computer have three IPs:

The Loopback address: localhost, 127.0.0.0 (The "0" can change)
The Intranet address (IP linked to your computer): 192.168.0.0, 172.16.0.0, 10.0.0.0
And the internet address (IP linked to your modem): 0.0.0.0

How to know your Intranet/internet IP? That depend of your Operating System and your modem. For the Intranet use your terminal and write "ifconfig" or "ipconfig". For your internet address, it is sometime write when you log you to your modem, or you have to visit a website who is able to show you your IP.
If you create a server and you didn't forward the port from your modem, you can still access to your server in local with your Loopback address and the others computers connected to the same modem can also access to the server with the Intranet address. Also, if you need to test if your server is accessible from internet, you have to test the connection with your internet IP, but some modem don't allow the externals connections from the Intranet... So if your connection with the internet IP doesn't work, try to log you to your server from another modem (friend's PC, Cyber-Coffee...).
Lastly, how to protect your server?
This is really difficult and you cannot create a perfect security... Especially if you follow my advices but you didn't complete my knowledge with your own research.

Root access

This is the most important part. When a lamer try to access to your server, he can just try a simple connection like the http/ssh/ftp. If he can access to your hard disk and you haven't chose a strong restriction, he can simply read/modify/delete the Data Base of your game. The Data Base contain all the informations about the accounts.

Firewall

We have already talk about the amount of connections/calculation than a server have to handle. In some attack, the lamer try to create a big amount of connections and didn't close them. We call that a DOS (with 1 computer) or DDOS (more than 1 computer). So you need a good firewall for: allow only the port of your server, allow only X numbers of connections from an unique IP and allow only X numbers of new connections every minutes.

Updates

This is the easiest part: keep your Operating System (and the others applications) up to date.

Less is better

Don't install many useless software to your server. If a software is not import for your server, you shouldn't install him because: firstly, that can be a virus. Secondly, a malware can exploit this software for install a virus or steal the root access.

Encryption

The encryption is really important for block an Hacker. For example, with the https protocol you can protected the user's passwords from the MITM attack. And with the Bluefish/SHA/others, you can encrypt your Data Base for protect her even if an Hacker can read it. The most important is always to block the write/modify/deletion/execute right of the Hacker (in fact, all the clients of your game need the read access).

Anti-virus?

In the case of an online-game, an anti-virus is not really important (But still recommended for all Operating System, Linux/Unix also).

Have a good server

If your server is programmed without take care of the security, you can be in trouble. Example: Buffer Overflow attack in C/C++.

Hint - If you are interesting by create an online game, you have to do many research, I cannot really answer in this question because is not the purpose of the subject. And this subject is too large for write a new answer at each question... Which software use for program a game? How to build a socket? Where started? But I have already answer at some similar questions. Even if the programming language are sometime different, I give you the link, the logic is always the same so it can maybe help you:

Hyperbaric oxygen: does it promote growth or recurrence of malignancy?
It has been a concern that a therapeutic modality recommended as an adjunct to healing and administered to promote proliferation of fibroblasts, epithelial cells and blood vessels in a wound could also lead to proliferation of malignant cells and angiogenesis in a malignant tumor. The first reported concern that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) might have cancer growth enhancing effects appeared in a paper by Johnson and Lauchlan in 1966. In a series of patients treated with HBO2 radiosensitization, they reported a more frequent than expected incidence of metastases and an unusual pattern of metastases. The published literature from clinical reports, animal studies and cell culture studies are reviewed. Putative mechanisms whereby HBO2 could have carcinogenic effects are discussed. The processes of angiogenesis in wound healing and in cancer growth are compared and contrasted. In vitro, in vivo and clinical studies strongly suggest no more than a neutral effect of HBO2 on tumor growth. In fact some studies suggest a negative impact of HBO2 on malignant progression or formation. For angiogenesis, similarities in wound healing and cancer are striking but significant differences are found including the relative importance of angiogenic factors and the process of cessation of angiogenesis. Tumors that grow in hypoxic environments are more prone to metastases and more lethal to the patient. They are also more likely to mutate toward resistant genotypes. Discussion of postulated mechanisms of carcinogenesis including free radical and immunosuppressive effects points out why they are not likely to enhance or cause cancer growth or initiation. In conclusion, the published literature on tumor angiogenesis mechanisms and other possible mechanisms of cancer causation or accelerated growth provides little basis for HBO2 to enhance malignant growth or metastases. A history of malignancy should not be considered a contraindication for HBO2 therapy.

RALEIGH. Duke Energy has filed a request with the North Carolina Utilities Commission for rate hikes that would give subsidiary Duke Energy Progress an additional $477 million a year. Duke Energy Progress has not raised rates since 2012. The utility’s request of 14% for households and 9% for businesses was approved by the utilities commission, but cut to an average of 5% by the state Supreme Court. Duke is now asking for what would amount to an average 14.9% average increase, with a typical residential rate increasing 16.7%, or $17.80 a month. Additional revenues would help pay for an $11 billion investment the company is making in converting plants to source natural gas and renewables over the next 10 years, $25 billion it is spending upgrading transmission systems to accept input from renewable generators and ward off cyberattacks, and $5.1 billion needed to remediate coal ash ponds. Duke’s other NC subsidiary, Duke Energy Carolinas, will likely request its rate increase later in the year.

Auntie's is Spokane's largest independently owned book store, and it's nice and big. It is open seven days a week, and seems to be thriving. When I was there on a Sunday afternoon, the place was hopping.. The children's section (one of my favorites in any bookstore) is large and interesting and I wanted to live there.. I also love that Auntie's--like Powell's in Portland--stocks new and used books side-by-side. Why every bookstore doesn't do this, I don't know. Well, I probably do, but I don't like it.. If you're ever in Spokane, pay a visit to Auntie's. It's a great way to kill a few hours. Or days.. - Posted using BlogPress from my iPhone

Hepatitis Australia is currently developing a campaign to reach baby boomers and other community groups who may have been missed in past hepatitis C awareness raising efforts.. Almost eight out of ten people living with hepatitis C are not current injecting drug users. Although the majority of Australians who acquire hepatitis C did so through unsafe injecting, 67 per cent (124,590) of them are no longer injecting drug users.. Close to 230,000 people were living with hepatitis C at the end of 2015. Of these, 25,000 (11%) were born overseas in regions of high prevalence and almost 16,000 (7%) contracted the virus through transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products, unsterile medical procedures, or mother-to-child transmission..

Apart from physiological changes, teenagers have to cope with psychological changes too. Not only does their world-view undergo rapid change, the world-view of family and friends changes as well. Often parents don’t realize that their teenager’s refusal to sleep at the proper hour may in fact be a serious health issue and not a rebellious act. Adolescence or teenagehood is the most crucial period of our life because it is the time where we evolve from child into adult.

During exercise, lactic acid or lactate is produced in contracting skeletal muscle. Lactic acid acid that is not otherwise used by the cell is cleared from the cell and carried into the blood stream as lactate since hydrogen ion dissociates from lactic acid. Individuals have a resting blood lactate concentration. The more a muscle cell contracts, however, the more lactic acid or lactate is produced in the muscle cell and the more lactic acid is carried into the blood stream as lactate and dissociated hydrogen ion. When the rate of production of lactic acid exceeds the rate of lactate clearance or removal and hydrogen ion buffering capacity, blood lactate concentration increases and blood pH decreases.
The blood lactate concentration for an individual at which the individual has a reduced ability to sustain exercise intensity as manifested, for example, by fatigue is known as the lactate threshold or maximal lactate steady state. A common maximal lactate steady state in an individual is about 4 mmol blood lactate. Individuals with an ability to sustain a higher percentage of their maximum capacity for exercise before reaching maximal lactate steady state tend to be better endurance athletes. That is, an individual's ability to sustain a higher percentage of their maximum capacity for exercise before reaching maximal lactate steady state can be used to predict endurance performance.
A common method for increasing an individual's lactate threshold or for improving an individual's work output at maximal lactate steady state is through exercise training. Regular exercise training increases mitochondrial biogenesis such that the content of mitochondria is increased in muscle. Without wishing to be bound by scientific theory, a higher mitochondrial mass may lead to a lower rate of lactic acid production, an increased clearance rate of lactate (via oxidation) or both for a given level of exercise intensity. As a result, lactate threshold is effectively increased or lactate response during exercise is effectively improved, that is, the individual has the ability to exercise at a higher intensity before exceeding their maximal lactate steady state, for example before a blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol is reached.
Quercetin is a flavonol found in some fruits and vegetables. A cocktail including quercetin, green tea extract, vitamin C, vitamin E, caffeine, niacin, taurine, vitamin B6, vitamin B2, vitamin B1, and glucose was studied and reported to improve cycling time trial performance under certain conditions. However, the investigators recognized that the improved performance could not be attributed to quercetin alone. See MacRae and Mefferd, International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, 2006, 16, 405-419. Quercetin has been reported to increase mouse brain and mouse muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and exercise tolerance in mice. See Davis et al., Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Inter. Comp. Physiol. 296: R1071-R1077 (2009). Quercetin has also been reported to increase maximal oxygen uptake and cycling performance in certain individuals. See Davis et al., International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, 2009, 20, 1013. The effect of quercetin and DMSO on skeletal myogenesis from C2C12 skeletal muscle cells has been reported. See Basic Appl Myol 11 (1): 31-44 (2001). However, none of the studies demonstrated a method of reducing blood lactate concentration by administration of quercetin to an individual, methods of improving muscle cell performance in an individual by reducing blood lactate concentration, or methods of increasing the lactate threshold or the maximal lactate steady state in an individual allowing extended high intensity physical activity.
It is therefore an object of the present invention to reduce blood lactate concentration in an individual by administration of quercetin. It is a further object of the present invention to extend high intensity physical activity by reducing blood lactate concentration. It is a still further object of the present invention to create an assay for identifying compounds capable of reducing lactic acid concentrations in a muscle cell. These and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention or certain embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following disclosure and description of exemplary embodiments.

Posted by Bram Reichbaum at 7:13 PM. When was this conversation?. Hey - where's the trash can story?. Sorry ... the conversation was held I think in about April of 2007.. This is precisely why Dowd will not win the primary. Excellent debater about the issues. I enjoy listening to him articulate his point of view. He can vote with the best of them, but where's his authority? Perhaps he's great behind the scenes and doesn't care about the credit, but if that's the case, then where are the endorsements?. Baby Huey will win touting his balanced budgets and his (by his accounting) initiatives which have helped our great city.. When was this conversation?. It was during an unseasonably warm Sunday afternoon during the 2007 primary season.. Also, my wife's right: I DO look slightly less idiotic with short-cropped hair.

RASONs: a novel antisense oligonucleotide therapeutic approach for asthma.
Inhalation based approaches enable the local delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASONs) to the respiratory tract and thus facilitate the ability of ASONs to target and modulate the activity of discordantly expressed respiratory disease genes. Studies involving EPI-2010, a respirable antisense oligonucleotide (RASON), targeting the adenosine A(1) receptor, a G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) that plays an important role in the aetiology of asthma, demonstrate that ASON therapeutics can be delivered directly to the lung as an aerosol. EPI-2010 has been shown to inhibit adenosine A(1) receptor expression and significantly improve allergen-induced airway obstruction and bronchial hyper-responsiveness in animal models of human asthma. Absorption, tissue distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) and safety studies of aerosolised EPI-2010 suggest that phosphorothioate RASONs can be delivered to target respiratory tissues in low, safe, efficacious and long-acting doses. This supports the concept that RASONs offer the potential to address a variety of respiratory targets including those for which approaches employing systemic distribution and systemic bioavailability of the therapeutic agent may be undesirable. In addition, our studies with EPI-2010 indicate that the RASON approach may represent a technology that is uniquely positioned to address the challenges of the post-genome era in respiratory drug discovery, since it enables simultaneous in vivo target validation and antisense therapeutic discovery in an accelerated timeframe.

I am taking my reception centerpieces pretty seriously. When I worked as a floral designer, I made so many bubble bowl arrangements that I promised myself that when my time came to get married, I'd do something with a little more originality. One idea I'm toying around with is old Limoges bowls filled with garden roses. Ebay has an awesome selection from $5 to $200 a piece. Yard sales, auctions, and antique stores also good places to browse. Here are a few I found on Ebay:. I love the different shapes and patterns! At the end of the reception, you can give the arrangements to favorite relatives, or keep the bowls for yourself and have a great collection for dinner parties. Each year, on your anniversary, set a romantic table for dinner and fill a bowl with the same flowers used on your wedding day. Any way you slice it, these bowls will be a lasting keepsake.

First to define neonatal intensive care. Now we're revolutionizing it. A lot has changed since we opened the first Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in 1960. That's why, when we set out to design a brand new NICU unlike any other, we applied the latest developments and best practices in neonatology to devise a revolutionary new model of care. Maternal/neonatal couplet rooms, an onsite procedure room, advanced technology and the future home of the latest neonatal MRI are just a few of the reasons our NICU is one of the most advanced in the country. So families will have a better experience while they're here and know they've given their baby the best possible opportunity for a happy, healthy life. ynhch.org

Just a few sample pics of the B-17G 42-32076 Shoo Shoo Shoo Baby from my personal archives documenting the B-17s I have had the good fortune to see in person. It was great to see it at the National Museum of the USAF during the 447th BG reunion in Dayton, OH.. Being held for future delivery to the Smithsonian, access to the Shoo Shoo Shoo Baby is not open to the public, and it was through a very generous arrangement that Mitchell and I were escorted onto the Wright-Patterson AFB to see it and the B-17E The Swoose. We also learned about other extraordinary and unique projects they have in the works. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity that we shall remember for a long long time!

Feathers are everywhere right now. I do think the feathers in the hair is cute but I'm probably a little too old to pull off that trend. I did see some adorable feather earrings in the store but they were so long that they reached my shoulders. I knew I would never wear them. So, I decided to make some myself.. Jo-Ann's fabric has tons of feathers available and I already had earring bales on hand. I actually just used duct tape to attach the feathers to the earrings. i wasn't sure if I was going to like them and told myself that if I did, then I would re-do them. I do like them and have worn them a few times but I know I will never get around to re-doing them. Just look at my To-Do Pinterest board and you know I'll never get around to most of the things that I want to do ;-). I love your comments, please leave one.

Massed Voices and the Charismatic Encounter

It is a feature of charismatic leaders that they are most famously depicted surrounded by crowds. Hitler addressing his rallies, Jesus feeding the five thousand: one of the ways we recognise charismatic authority is by its power to galvanise large groups.

But I have been thinking recently about how the large groups themselves may be part of the dynamic that generates the charismatic encounter. If we consider Raymond Bradley's conception of charisma as a property that emerges from a group with a particular set of beliefs and relational structures that attribute the extraordinary powers to a particular person or social position, it seems that the crowd is as important as the leader in creating the experience.

I have been thinking about this in particular in relation to the phenomenon of massed-choir events. These may be a feature of festivals, of civic events, or as one of the commercial ventures that have sprung up in recent years that offer participants local preparation over a number of weeks leading up to a concert in a major venue. If you lead a choir, you will get reasonably regular invitations to bring your singers along to participate in these.

My observation of these events is that they often feature the key elements of Bradley's category of communion: intense bonds of love/brotherhood, optimism, and euphoria. And it strikes me that the experience of communion that massed choirs offer is much the same in process and structure as that offered by a regular choir, but intensified by iteration at an extra level.

The processes involved include:

Separation from everyday life: The regular choral rehearsal is often configured as an experience bracketed off from our day-to-day activities. It has its own particular space with its own special layout; the act of warming-up is not just a matter of vocal technique, but is also a ritual by which we leave the outside world behind and step into our choral identities. But regular experience can easily habituate us, and ritual slips into routine.

The massed voice event re-invigorates this dimension by separating singers from their regular rehearsal spaces and placing them somewhere marked out as significantly more special than the social spaces choirs occupy as a matter of course: concert halls, cathedrals - large spaces that a provide cultural focal point to a significant size of regional population.

The reputational effect of a special leader: Bradley identifies the existence of shared beliefs in extraordinary powers as a primary facilitator of charismatic experiences; the followers need to be ready-primed to be inspired in order to hand over their executive control to a leader.

The role of conductor is richly imbued with mythologies of extraordinary powers, which frame the relationship between director and choir. But the more conspicuously public figures who lead the massed voice events have a significantly greater promotional infrastructure behind them to generate this halo effect. This is partly to do with the set-up of their appearance: their inspirational reputation is often a key element in the advertising used to attract singers, and the event itself will place them at the centre of attention. But it's also to do with the way the singers don't have the opportunity to develop a longer-term insight into their feet of clay as they do with the directors they work with regularly.

The merging of individual egos into the group: All choral singing involves a process of de-inviduation through coordinated activity - it is inherent in the activity itself, and we have a whole panoply of rehearsal techniques we use to promote it. (Though we tend to call it by musical terms such as blend, ensemble or section unity.)

At a massed choir event, this merging works in two layers. The individual is merged into their normal choir, and the different choirs are merged into the supra-choir. The effect of this merging is partly driven just by the larger group - the more people there are, the less any one individual counts, so this is an area in which the sheer weight of numbers has an effect. And of course aurally and vocally, the bigger the sound that surrounds you is, the more you feel buoyed up by it, carried along by the stream of sound.

But also, and perhaps counter-intuitively, the greater anonymity of massed-voice events enhances the feelings of love and brotherhood. The group is bound together emotionally not by their mutual acquaintance and shared history, but by the shared experience in the moment. The niggles of choir politics and personality clashes melt away in the new context, superseded by the imperatives of the occasion.

And those imperatives are key. Not all massed-voice events turn into charismatic encounters - they still need a cause and crisis to create the spark.

For instance, the Welsh premiere of Karl Jenkins' The Peacemakers back in July was in many ways configured as a charismatic encounter, but it didn't in fact ignite into one. You could hear it in the voices: it was a good quality collection of singers, but there wasn't that clarion ring to the sound you get when a choir is really lit up.

Now, this event had many of the elements needed: the massed voices, its placement at the heart of a festival that itself is well-structured to create communion, the use of video imagery from previous Eisteddfods at Llangollen to further build emotional bonds between participants and audience members, the reputational aura of the composer himself conducting.

It had a clear cause, too - the desire for peace has that quality of an abstract, moral good that underpins all charismatic movements. But it lacked the urgency of a crisis - both text and music focused exclusively on the desideratum of peace, without showing us why it was important to strive for it. The programme notes likewise gave a brief, sad comment that the world seemed no nearer to peace than a decade ago, but that wasn't enough in itself to act as a call to action.

(Don't get me wrong, it was a successful concert with much musical beauty. But it didn't get into that transformative state of euphoria that marks a charismatic encounter.)

Contrast this to the tales of the performance of Jenkins' The Armed Man: A Mass for Peace with its accompanying footage of the carnage of war. I've not seen this, but everyone I have talked to who has speaks of it with the kind of light in their eyes and ring the voice that betokens a peak experience. And they all identify the friction between musical beauty and harrowing imagery as key to their emotional response.

So, just collecting a big crowd about you won't guarantee a charismatic encounter. But if you have collected the elements to generate one, the more people you have there, the greater will be the intensity of the experience.

[The development of pneumothorax in an elderly woman during treatment for nontuberculous mycobacterium].
We report the case of an 82-year-old woman who developed pneumothorax during treatment for nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM). In year X, she was diagnosed with NTM at another hospital after abnormalities were pointed out on a chest X-ray. She received no treatment for NTM at that time. Antibiotic treatment was introduced at the department of respiratory medicine in our hospital in year X+15. The regimen was composed of clarithromycin (800 mg/day), ethambutol (750 mg/day) and rifampicin (600 mg/day); however, treatment with the three-drug antibiotic regimen was canceled at her request and changed to erythromycin. She was then referred to our department. However, right-side cavity wall thickening was detected on chest CT in year X+17.We resumed clarithromycin (600 mg/day), ethambutol (750 mg/day) and rifampicin (450 mg/day). On the 43rd day after treatment with three types of antibiotics, she felt dyspnea and she was admitted to the hospital and was diagnosed with right-side pneumothorax. The pneumothorax was thought to have been caused by a break in the adhesion of the cavity wall. The visceral pleura was weakened by the exacerbation of NTM and the thickness of the cavity wall was improved after the resumption of antibiotic therapy. This report is considered to be an important case in which pneumothorax developed as a complication in an elderly patient during treatment for NTM.

But for The Children's Investment Fund, a $14.5 billion hedge fund that has a stake in the LSE, that doesn't spell the end for consolidation in the exchange space.

In a letter to investors, Chis Hohn, the founder of TCI, said that "exchange consolidation is still possible with InterContinental Exchange (ICE) potentially bidding for LSE."

ICE is run by Jeff Sprecher, and has been a serial dealmaker in the past, acquiring NYSE Euronext in 2013. As part of that deal, it acquired exchange-traded derivative market LIFFE. The prospect of combining LIFFE with LCH, which is owned by the LSE, is appealing to Hohn.

He wrote:

"The strategic logic is compelling as LIFFE, the second largest ETD [exchange-traded derivatives] platform in Europe, would be united with LCH, the largest OTC [over-the-counter] platform in the world. ICE would also use its proprietary data sets to launch FTSE Russell-branded ETFs [exchange-traded funds]."

These kinds of cross-border deals involving financial market infrastructure can often be fraught, political affairs. However, there is "political logic" for the UK government to permit an ICE deal for the LSE, Hohn wrote.

"It aligns the UK financial system with that of the US, which is compelling post-Brexit and cements London’s position as the derivatives capital of the financial world," Hohn said.

"A combination would create a business services powerhouse that is levered to many secular growth trends (indexing, market data and technology) with significant cross selling opportunities (corporate solutions, IT services)," the bank said.

Ground is Broken for Blackstock Field

March 19, 1921

March 19, 1921, Greencastle, Ind. - The entire student body of DePauw gathered today with many alumni and friends of the University on the western edge of campus today as groundbreaking ceremonies were held for the new Blackstock Athletic Field. The new facility is made possible by a $25,000 gift from Mr. and Mrs. Ira B. Blackstock. Mr. Blackstock is an 1886 graduate of DePauw and serves as a member of the University's Board of Trustees.

Plans call for a sodded football field, a practice gridiron, a separate baseball diamond, a one-quarter mile track, a 220-yard straightaway and tennis courts. Eventually, the University will construct concrete bleachers at the site. The current athletic field, McKeen Field, will be used for intramural athletics, once Blackstock Field is ready for use.

Ira Blackstock earned a bachelor's degree from DePauw in 1886 and received his master's degree from the University in 1893. In 1907, he was made a Trustee of DePauw.

Tight focusing of quasi-cylindrically polarized beams.
Based on vectorial diffraction theory, tight focusing properties of quasi-cylindrical polarized beams (QCPBs) composed of equal fan-shaped sectors with linear polarization are investigated. We find that, for quasi-radially polarized illumination, a weak azimuthal component emerges and the circular symmetry of focus is traded in when the total number of sector N is small, but when N≥8 it is approaching that of a perfect radially polarized beam with a deviation smaller than 5.3% and a ratio of maximum total intensity larger than 95.5%. Meanwhile, for quasi-azimuthal polarized illumination, although weak radial and longitudinal components emerge, it is also close to that of the perfect azimuthally polarized beam when N≥8 with deviation smaller than 5.3% and a ratio larger than 95.0%. These results not only reveal a deep understanding of the focusing properties of QCPBs, but also provide an important contribution toward optimization of the monolithic methods for generating vector beams.

Disillusioned by his bitter rivalry with Thomas Edison over the invention of the incandescent lightbulb, 41-year-old Maine-born inventor Hiram Stevens Maxim sailed for England in 1881, never to return to the United States. Aware that his career in electrical engineering had ended, Maxim became consumed with creating an automatic gun, inspired by the casual remark of an American friend, who said, “Hang your chemistry and electricity! If you want to make a pile of money, invent something that will enable these Europeans to cut each other’s throats with greater facility.”

A Mandeville coffee shop and eatery housed in one of the city's oldest commercial buildings was granted authority to expand its operations by the Planning and Zoning Commission Tuesday night. The Scotts, which occupies part of the first floor of the historic St. Tammany Bank Building at 201 Carroll St., sought approval from the commission to expand the business into an existing room that adjoins the coffee bar.. Scott Williams, who co-owns the old Mandeville business with Scott Discon, said they want to enlarge the kitchen and add event space to the small shop that takes up what was once the lobby of the area's first bank.. The commission, which had previously approved a zoning permit for the coffee shop, Tuesday night voted unanimously in favor of the business's new site plan. Williams said the six-month old shop needs to expand its cramped kitchen area.. The two-story St. Tammany Bank Building, located one block from Lake Pontchartrain at the corner of Carroll and Claiborne streets, was built in 1904.

Bariatric Counseling (pre or post surgery)

Bariatricprocedures, while often medically necessary, can be emotionally and physically challenging.Supportive therapies examining one’s emotional relationship with food, coping strategies, and nutritional support are necessary to ultimately achieve one’s optimum level of health.

Your relationship with food is a focus of bariatric counseling- Understanding the “when, what and why of eating.”

Emotional support- Your changing body and relationship with food is an evolving process. It can be overwhelming, exciting, confusing- a spectrum of emotions. Understanding and normalizing these feelings is critical to healing physically and emotionally.

Hardly here 24 hours and have already reconnected with so many local friends, returning friends, and even had time to make new friends.. My long time wonderful friend Sue was visiting her daughter in Firenze, then spent a night with us before heading home. We had appertivo last night at Tuscher Cafe (Benita’s favorite!),. then lunch there again today including Pici Amatriciana and a caprese salad.. Pici is like a thick spaghetti, made from flour and water only. It originated in the Siena area and is usually only found in Tuscany. The Amatriciana included speck, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes and cheese. Delicioso! And as usual, there’s nothing quite like an Italian tomato.. In between all the eating, we managed some walking on the steep streets of this lovely Etruscan town.. And then just before heading home, we stopped in the piazza, and as usual, always something happening.. Finally, I had to stop these kids as I had never seen so large a gelato. Glad I got to them before the dripping began!. Ciao for now,. Judy

Governor Xu Visits Finland to Promote Hunan-Finland Co-op

2017-07-17

Hunan Governor Xu Dazhe visited Finland between July 13 and 15, 2017, to promote Hunan-Finland cooperation in the “Belt and Road” Initiative efforts.

Governor Xu went to the Northern Europe & Hunan Agriculture Industrial Park in Kouvola, Kymenlaakso region. He met with the Kymenlaakso Parliament President and congress member at the Hunan-Finland Exchange and Cooperation Meeting, and signed a province-region cooperation agreement. He also witnessed some Hunan and Finnish companies reaching cooperation agreements.

Xu hoped that Hunan and Finland will, under the cooperation agreement, enhance governmental communication and visits, to support non-governmental and company cooperation. Beyond that, resource, industrial, and technological advantages should be used to promote bilateral cooperation in ecological agriculture; environmental protection; sci-tech innovation; economic and trade; logistics; culture; and, tourism.

Civil rights advocates and Muslim leaders in Australia have widely denounced new legislation that calls for dual nationals who are convicted of terrorism-related offenses to be stripped of their Australian citizenship.

The legislation is designed to staunch the flow of Australians going to the Middle East to join groups such as the self-described Islamic State, and to help prevent domestic terror attacks like the hostage crisis in Sydney last December that left three people dead.

The Australian Parliament has passed a raft of anti-terrorism laws in the past 12 months that grant law enforcement agencies new sweeping powers. They can now monitor Internet traffic of suspected jihadists and prevent people from traveling to conflict zones in Syria and Iraq.

But with many Australians considering citizenship a fundamental right, the legislation introduced to Parliament on Wednesday is among the most controversial anti-terrorism measures yet. Civil rights groups have raised concerns about its scope and constitutionality, while Muslim leaders have accused the government of singling out their community.

Losing citizenship

If Parliament passes the legislation, Australia would join a small group of countries – including France, Britain, and New Zealand – that have similar laws. Yet most have rarely used the power to revoke citizenship.

“If enacted, our legislation will be as tough as exists in any equivalent Western nation in dealing with citizenship and terrorism,” says Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra.

The government estimates that just over half of the approximately 120 Australians who have traveled to Iraq and Syria to fight for IS are dual citizens.

Under the proposed laws, Australian citizenship would be automatically forfeited if a person was convicted of a terrorist act by an Australian court or found to be engaged in terrorist activity at home or abroad. The law would also apply to anyone providing or receiving training linked to terrorism, as well as recruiting or financing for jihadist groups. Any loss of citizenship would be open to judicial review.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott initially proposed granting the immigration minister the power to revoke a person’s citizenship without any chance of judicial review. He also wanted to extend the legislation to cover sole nationals. The plan led to a chorus of criticism from government officials and legal experts who warned that it would breach the constitution.

Constitutional lawyer Professor Greg Craven told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he welcomed an amendment to the legislation that prevents the immigration minister from exercising sole executive power.

“If your citizenship did lapse … and you presented yourself in Australia, you would be perfectly free to say, 'No, that's not the case, I didn't do it, I wasn't there, I wasn't a member of that body', and ultimately that would have to be determined by a court,” he said.

Mr. Abbott has said that the question of whether the law should be applied to sole nationals and operate retrospectively would be reviewed separately.

Rodger Shanahan, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney, says critics of the new legislation ignore the fact that existing laws that automatically strip citizenship from dual nationals who fight for a country at war with Australia have been on the books for almost 70 years.

“The principle of the new laws is much the same expect that they apply to non-state actors such as terrorist groups,” he says.

Muslims raise concerns

The debate has caused disquiet among Australia’s 600,000 Muslims. Ghaith Krayem, president of the Islamic Council of Victoria, said at a recent anti-racism forum in Melbourne that the legislation is clearly aimed at Muslims.

“They are going to apply to our community, our community alone,” he said.

The legislation was introduced to Parliament amid reports that two of the most notorious IS fighters from Australia, Mohamed Elomar and Khalid Sharrouf, were killed recently in an airstrike in Iraq. Mr. Sharrouf gained widespread attention last year after the publication of photographs showing him posing with his young sons holding the severed heads of executed Syrian soldiers.

Mr. Shanahan says it is unlikely that the prospect of forfeiting Australian citizenship would have deterred either man from joining IS.

“Many of the recruits joining Islamic State are young and not concerned about losing their citizenship,” he says. “If you’re a dual national and you’re considering going to join a terrorist group, that means you’ve probably got an identity issue as it is.”

Mr. Jennings agrees that those who have gone further down the path of radicalization “would not be motivated by the fear of losing citizenship.” But he says it’s important for the government to be seen as doing something to combat homegrown terrorism.

“Ever since the Bali bombings, Australians have had a sense that there is a direct connection between terrorist ideologies in Asia and [the] Middle East,” he says, referring to the 2002 terrorist attack on the Indonesian resort island that killed 202 people, nearly half of them Australians. “The government needs to be seen to be talking tough, so the emphasis is very much on the punitive aspects of the fight against terrorism.”

Ethical issues related to HIV/AIDS: case reports.
The continents of Africa and Asia have the highest number of HIV infected persons in the world. Worldwide there are 42 million and 29.7 million (70%) are in sub Saharan Africa [United Nations AIDS (UNAIDS). Available from: www.unaids.org]. The stigma and discrimination attached to HIV/AIDS are hampering control of the disease. Family life has greatly been disrupted by the pandemic. AIDS causes illness, disability and death as well as severe economic and emotional disruptions to the families. The epidemic is well established in South Africa. The mortality will be doubled over the next five years. A broad range of coercive measures has been considered to be applied internationally in the interest of controlling the spread of HIV. Responsibility of the employers to their HIV/AIDS employees at workplace, choice of termination of pregnancy when a woman is HIV positive, attitude of health care provider to their HIV infected patients, informed consent for taking blood to protect from transmission of infection in a case of accidental prick, and forced resignation from employment, are discussed in this manuscript. The ethical problems are highlighted, and possible solutions recommended.

That just means that the fuel filter has to work harder as your vehicle ages. It'll get clogged sooner and need to be replaced more often.. A symptom of a clogged fuel filter is that the engine sputters at LA highway speeds or under hard acceleration. That's because enough fuel is getting through around Slidell, but when you need more fuel for speed, enough just can't get through the filter. Obviously, that could be dangerous if your car or truck can't get enough power to get you out of harm's way on a busy Slidell freeway.. For just that reason, fuel filters have a bypass valve. When the filter is severely clogged, some fuel can bypass the filter all together. Of course that means that dirty, unfiltered fuel is getting through to be burned in the vehicle engine.. This dirt can then clog and damage your fuel injectors. Now injectors are not cheap to replace in Slidell, Advantage Tire Wheel & accessories in Slidell. But if it's neglected, it could lead to thousands of dollars of repair bills.

Trump opioid panel member says ‘We want medicine, not media’

Trump opioid panel member says ‘We want medicine, not media.’

(CNN) Former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, a member of the President’s commission on opioid addiction, has a message for the Trump administration a day before it is expected to declare a national emergency on the epidemic: “We want medicine, not media.”

When asked about first lady Melania Trump’s recent focus on the issue and the expectation she will continue to be part of the public effort, Kennedy didn’t mince words.

“We don’t want any more photo-ops,” the former Democratic congressman from Rhode Island said in a phone interview with CNN on Wednesday. “I’m just speaking as an advocate, in this fight every single day as someone who is in recovery and someone who is an advocate. We don’t want any more visits to rehab centers and photo-ops, saying how courageous we are. Enough already. We want to save lives.”

Advocates for Opioid Recovery is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing a science-based, evidence-based treatment system that can reduce death and suffering from opioid addiction, and produce more long-term opioid addiction survivors who are positively engaged in their families and communities.

According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 2 to 5 percent of all cancer patients have metastatic (secondary) tumors for which routine testing cannot locate the primary site. This is called cancer of unknown primary origin. Patients may be diagnosed with cancer of unknown primary origin if the primary tumor is too small to be identified with routine imaging tests, it regresses (disappears) before a secondary tumor arises or the secondary tumor has several possible primary sites. Cancer of unknown primary origin can appear anywhere in the body, but is most commonly found in the lymph nodes, liver, lungs, bones or skin... About miRview ® Precision Therapeutics.

1. Field of the Invention
The present invention is directed to vehicle occupant restraint systems, and specifically to a pivoting arm that operates as a seat belt upper anchor point.
2. Background of the Invention
An occupant restraint system in a vehicle such as an automobile, truck, van, helicopter, airplane or any other self-propelled vehicle is an expensive component, yet critical for safety. A popular restraint system is the three-point system including a lap belt secured at a first and second point and a torso belt secured at the second and a third point. The first point, in many designs, comprises a lap belt inertial retractor that removes slack from the lap belt and locks-up upon a sudden stop.
The second point typically is a tongue and buckle arrangement wherein the buckle is secured to the side of a seat opposite the inertial lap belt retractor and the tongue can be secured to and released from the buckle. Respective ends of the lap belt and torso belt are either secured to the tongue in a fixed tongue arrangement or, in a sliding tongue arrangement, the lap belt and torso belt comprise a continuous belt that can slide through an opening in the tongue. The third point in a three-point system typically includes an inertial retractor located in the lower portion of a B-pillar (in the case of an automobile, for example) and the torso belt passes through a D-ring typically attached to an upper part of the B-pillar. In some more recent designs, the torso belt retractor and D-ring are attached to the seat frame.
Many recent restraining system designs provide for a vertically slideable D-ring (height adjuster) to accommodate passengers of varying size in addition to the one or both inertial retractors used to supply or take-up the appropriate amount of torso belt length to accommodate a specific individual. In any event, the constant sliding motion of the torso belt through this D-ring leads to undesirable wear on the torso belt itself, thereby decreasing the torso belt's ultimate strength and presenting undesirable appearance. Furthermore, in a fixed tongue arrangement, it is expensive to have two inertial retractors. Further still, a manual or motor driven D-ring height adjuster is expensive.

Three year outcome of the residents in a special nursing home.
The 3 year outcome of 48 residents in a special nursing home was investigated, using Hasegawa's dementia rating scale (HDS) and activities of daily living (ADL). For all the residents, HDS score correlates well with age (P < 0.01) and ADP score (P < 0.001). Nineteen residents (40.4%) died during the period surveyed. Two-thirds of the residents with low ADL score died during the period, whereas 70% of the residents with high ADL score are alive. Of these scales, ADL correlated well with the fatal prognosis, suggesting that ADL is a valuable prognostic tool. As for the causes of death, pulmonary disease was prominent (n = 12, 63.2%). Consequently, the prevention of pulmonary disease is needed to achieve a good outcome in the management of nursing home residents.

Q:

How to determine the value of socket listen() backlog parameter?

How should I determine what to use for a listening socket's backlog parameter?  Is it a problem to simply specify a very large number?

A:

There's a very long answer to this in the Winsock Programmer's FAQ. It details the standard setting, and the dynamic backlog feature added in a hotfix to NT 4.0.

A:

I second using SOMAXCONN, unless you have a specific reason to use a short queue. 
Keep in mind that if there is no room in the queue for a new connection, no RST will be sent, allowing the client to automatically continue trying to connect by retransmitting SYN. 
Also, the backlog argument can have different meanings in different socket implementations. 

In most it means the size of the half-open connection queue, in some it means the size of the completed connection queue.
In many implementations, the backlog argument will multiplied to yield a different queue length.
If a value is specified that is too large, all implementations will silently truncate the value to maximum queue length anyways.

A:

From the docs:

A value for the backlog of SOMAXCONN is a special constant that instructs the underlying service provider responsible for socket s to set the length of the queue of pending connections to a maximum reasonable value.

The temples get revenue through selling of prasadams, argitaseva and others, money from hundis, lease from lands and other sources.

Hyderabad: Devotees visiting major temples have to pay more from July. Major temples, which have more than Rs 20 lakh annual revenue, are brought under Goods and Service Tax (GST) purview.

There are 149 such temples in Telangana state. Section 73 of the GST Act states renting of rooms, where charges are Rs 1,000 or more per day, renting of premises, community halls, Kalyanamandapam or open area where charges are Rs 10,000 or more per day, will attract 18 per cent tax.

But it is not clear whether GST will be collected on Argitaseva tickets or other services extended by the temples. Telangana endowment minister A. Indrakaran Reddy said that there were 149 temples that earn over Rs 20 lakh annual revenue. Out of which, 16 temples had over Rs 1 crore annual revenue while three had over Rs 25 lakh annual revenue, he said.

He said it is not clear as to which services will attract GST in these temples. Officials said raw material for the preparation of prasadams will cost more. For example, 5% GST was imposed on cashew nuts, and 12% GST on ghee.

The temples get revenue through selling of prasadams, argitaseva and others, money from hundis, lease from lands and other sources. The officials said whether the income of temple through hundis will also come under taxable revenue or not is not clear. Earlier, the state government used to give tax exemptions to temples.

But, the government has started collecting GST from temples from now now. Some famous temples that come under GST purview are Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Devasthanam, Yadagirigutta, Nalgonda district; Sri Seetha Ramachandra Swamy Devasthanam, Bhadrachalam, Khammam district; Sri Gnana Saraswathi Ammavari Devasthanam, Basara in Adilabad district; Sri Yellamma Pochamma Devasthanam, Balkampet, Hyderabad and others.

About Me

Hello, and welcome to my slice of paradise ❤

My name is Nicki – I am 33 years old, Irish & Scottish, Bacon Lover, whiskey drinker and Netflix Marathoner… and I have an incurable wanderlust. After studying criminology and law, I went on to get my MBA because I love business. I have a full-time career in Washington, D.C. and I now utilize almost every weekend, holiday and time off to travel.

From a young age I was fiercely passionate about seeing the world and meeting people from all walks of life. At the ripe age of 18 I started taking seasonal jobs around the United States and traveling to 48 of the 50 states. Fast forward to today – I have one state left to visit .. hint: It is cold and located next to Canada.

Luxury travel, food and photography is something I have focused on for the last 10-11 years of my life in my travels. I love experiencing the best hotels in the world in different destinations while eating the local flare. I like to share my experiences traveling and eating around the globe on my social media channels and here on my blog. I’m good about responding to everyone – so don’t be shy.

How did I end up in this industry? By accident if I am being honest. I was working on my MBA and started a blog just to write about my travels and put pictures somewhere so that when people asked I could just direct them there. From the time I went to Hawaii in November of 2015 – I traveled almost entirely full-time until March of 2017 circling 3 continents. Once I finished my masters degree I decided to get a career at home and keep this part-time – but this is still full-time and I love it.

One of the most asked questions I get is: What is your favorite country?

It was Turkey – and Turkey was the top for about 7 years until I met Iceland. Iceland is a different kind of magical – one that I will never be able to put into words, but it gave me the butterflies and chills in a good way. I have this deep love affair with Iceland.

Glacier LagoonNorthern Lights – Vik, Iceland

Currently I am exploring North America for most of 2017 – if you happen to see me say hi! I love meeting new people and that is one of the reason I love to travel.

Discipline: Philosophy. This paper seeks to develop a Wittgensteinian response to the Scope Problem, which ensnares a theory of truth considered as inflationary. The scope problem challenges any inflationary truth theory to provide a single explanation which can account for the concept of truth given the diversity of statements that most of us are willing to accept as true. In line with Wittgenstein’s later views on language and philosophy and their corresponding functions, this paper provides a general diagnosis of the problem: similarities in syntax do not entail similarities in meaning. By employing Wittgenstein’s metaphors (i.e., “handles” and “tools”) and an analysis via concrete cases and analogies, this paper responds to the challenge presented by the Scope Problem not by providing a satisfactory definition of truth but rather, by providing its “dissolution” à la Wittgenstein.

Clubbers Guide 2003. Amp Associates has designed the cover for the Ministry of Sound’s bi-annual compilation album Clubbers Guide 2003, which is released on 7 January 2003. According to Amp Associates creative director Scott Parker, the consultancy was briefed to combine a strong commercial identity with the ‘coolness and credibility’ associated with club culture. To achieve what Parker describes as ‘these two contradictory requirements’, the consultancy used ‘strong, energetic and fashionable’ photography. ‘Simple understated typography allows the image to do the talking,’ adds Parker. The background effects were shot at London’s futuristic Cynthia’s Robot Bar. Parker worked on the project with art director Tom Lardner.

Cleghorn Lakes Wilderness

The Cleghorn Lakes Wilderness is a  wilderness area in the southern Mojave Desert. It is located  northeast of Twentynine Palms, California, and  north of Joshua Tree National Park. It is managed by the Bureau of Land Management.

Named for the dry lakes found at the center of the wilderness area, this area has a variety of natural resources. The east portion is mountainous while the west portion is a vast alluvial fan and bajada. Elevations range from  at the desert floor to the rugged Bullion Mountains, which rise more than  across a  stretch.

Natural history
Wildlife includes Desert bighorn sheep on the slopes, and desert tortoise in the valley floor and bajada habitats.

Native plants include: Barrel cactus, and Smoke trees (Psorothamnus spinosus)" in some bajadas. The Cleghorn Lakes offer occasional spring wildflower displays. The  Crucifixion Thorn (Castela emoryi) shrub has been found near the eastern edge of the wilderness boundary. It is native to California, Arizona, and Sonora state in Mexico. It listed by the California Native Plant Society as rare in California, but is more common elsewhere in the lower Sonoran Deserts.

Imagine what it would look like if billions of microscopic crystals consisting of intricate and complex designs, each absolutely unique, fell from the sky all at once for several months at a time. It may sound grandiose, but in many parts of the world this phenomena is simply known as snow. During colder months, when temperatures are no longer warm enough for condensation to sustain itself in liquid form, wet air freezes and turns to snow. Each snowflake is like a human fingerprint, unique in its formation, size, weight and design. What snowflakes do have in common, however, is their six-sided figure, an attribute all snow crystals share. And although snowflakes are generally small in size, the world's largest snowflake was recorded back in 1887 as 15-feet across and 8-inches deep.. But if snowflakes are just made of frozen water, what makes their distinct pattern? How can we be sure no two flakes are the same?

For several years, RFA has been examining how postsecondary systems and institutions have reformed their approach to student placement in first-year classes. Until recently it was common practice to place students based on a cut score of a single exam. Yet in the last several years, the sector has moved rapidly towards collecting a much broader array of student readiness indicators to ensure more accurate placement and increase student success. RFA’s work focuses on documenting changes to state and system postsecondary placement policies; and identifying both challenges and emerging best practices.

A statue, lies, and the legacy of James Cook. There is an argument going on at the moment about replacing the statue of James Cook on Mount Titirangi at Gisborne. Barney Tupara, a representative of Ngati Oenone says that the first meeting between Maori and Pakeha was violent and nine Maoris were killed. This is a blatant example of the lies Maori activists tell now about the first encounter between Maori and Europeans, and when it is not a lie it is a distortion of the truth. The journal of Captain Cook is clear, four or five Maoris were killed, the only query being if one was killed or injured, and it was the result of Maori aggression.Read more

The two councils pay us to organise and develop five Partnership Boards in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

Each Board’s role is to support and improve care for people who use health and adult social care services.

They do this by including some of the people who use these services in their design, delivery and evaluation.

Social care includes providing social work, personal care, protection or social support services to children or adults in need or at risk, or adults in need due to illness, disability, old age or poverty.

Each Partnership Board is made up of:

Service user representatives - called Independent Members

Voluntary sector service providers

Statutory services such as health and social care

The aim is for half of the members on each board and its Chair to be health and/or adult social care service users.

Raising issues with adult social care

The Chairs attend the Adult Social Care Forum organised by Cambridgeshire County and Peterborough City Councils, chaired by the Principal Social Worker. This gives the Boards and other partner organisations a direct communication link with the adult social care senior management.

Supporting people

Healthwatch organises the Board meetings and provides support and training to the Independent Members to help them in their roles.

Carers' Partnership Board

This Board helps to improve services for carers in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

Need replacement part for "13 3 DU CMC 2"

Hello, I have a broken channel balance that has the signage "13 3 DU CMC 2" (pictured).

What is the best replacement part for this? The channel length is 14", and width is 9/16".

Both end parts have "wings"

Thanks!

Thanks for posting! Before I can offer an applicable replacement for this channel balance, I just need to know a bit more information about the bottom attachment. Please take a look at our 15-004 and 15-005 channel balance shoes, and note their depths. As you can see, they are 1-3/32" deep and 1" deep, respectively. Which one more closely matches your own bottom attachment?

A quick learner from San Jose CA says:

April 26, 2013

It looks like it's closest to 1 3/32".

U.S.
Military Participation in MLK Holiday Is an Insult to Pacifist
Leader

Ever since the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. was first celebrated
as a national holiday in 1986, the U.S. military has attempted
to co-opt the commemoration by insinuating itself into local activities
around the country, acting as if King's supporters ought to welcome
the tacit endorsement. King himself would be horrified to learn
of this turn of events.

For example, in San Diego various military contingents march
in a MLK parade, military recruiters shadow the parade soliciting
young participants and observers, and a JROTC (Junior Reserve
Officer Training Corps) color guard participates in a MLK breakfast.
Peace activists in other cities report similar instances.

Prior to his assassination, King repeatedly spoke out against
the use of violence to resolve conflicts — which is, of course,
the hallmark of the military.

In particular, King raised his voice against U.S. military conduct
in Vietnam. According to David Garrow in his book Bearing the
Cross, King resolved to help end the war after he viewed pictures
of Vietnamese children maimed by napalm dropped on civilians by
the U.S. military. In 1967 King called the U.S. government "the
greatest purveyor of violence in the world today," according
to Garrow.

King also objected to the war because African Americans and other
people of color were dying in disproportionate numbers in Vietnam.
Moreover, many black GIs were being harassed by officers and were
not receiving deserved commendations, reinforcing racial oppression
and economic injustice found elsewhere in society. This tradition
continues in today's military, where people of color are still
more likely to wind up in military prisons and much less likely
to be made officers than whites.

King criticized the racist nature of the military and thereby
linked the issues of civil rights and militarism, much to the
dismay of government officials who henceforth tried to discredit
him. But a popular movement to promote King's ideals succeeded
in overcoming the objections and a national holiday in honor of
King was established.

In a move to appropriate the MLK holiday every year, the military
participates in various events. By doing so, it hopes to obfuscate
King's moral outrage at the crimes against humanity committed
by the military.

Let's honor King by challenging the military institution that
glorifies violence and sends recruiters to MLK celebrations —
and into our high schools. Let's challenge the illegitimate authority
of the Selective Service System — and laws that deny college financial
aid to draft resisters. Let's call for a federal budget that focuses
on education, health, transportation and environmental concerns
rather than building weapons of mass destruction and military
forces that are more than willing to use them.

I have condemned any organizer of war, regardless
of his rank or nationality.
- Martin Luther King Jr., Seeds of Liberation,
1964.

In her book “The Right Stuff for Children Birth to 8” (published by the NAEYC), Martha B. Bronson talks about five different ways of playing. Kids progress through all of them depending on ages, stages, gender, cultural context, personal preference and many other factors. The types of play are: * Active Play – physical activity, sports, playing outside * Make-Believe Play – playing with dolls, different types of role-play * Manipulative Play – construction and puzzles * Creative Play – playing music, drawing and painting, crafting * Learning Play – reading books, playing games, developing certain skills (via The Playful Side of Apps | Toca Boca) Found via Geek Dad

“Plastic Galaxy: The Story of Star Wars Toys” is a documentary that celebrates the action figures, play sets, space ships, and props we grew up with as kids – and still collect today. Through interviews with collectors, historians, former Kenner and Hasbro employees, and others, the film explores their history, influence, and continued impact on pop culture.

Engineers at the University of Southampton have developed an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) whose entire structure has been printed, including wings, integral control surfaces and access hatches. Credit: University of Southampton The plane, called SULSA (Southampton University Laser Sintered Aircraft), was printed on an EOS EOSINT P730 nylon laser sintering machine, which fabricates plastic or metal objects, building up the item layer by layer. Once all the components were printed, assembly took minutes, say the engineers. No fasteners were used and all equipment was attached using ’snap fit’ techniques so that the entire aircraft can be put together without tools. The electric-powered UAV has a wingspan of about 6.5 ft, has a top speed of nearly 100 miles per hour, and runs almost silent when in cruise mode. The team even equipped it with a miniature autopilot. Traditional manufacturing methods are costlier and would have required months to develop a similar plane, whereas the design and fabrication process for SULSA took just a few weeks. Because no tooling is required for manufacture, radical changes to the shape and scale of the aircraft can be made with no extra cost. Professors Jim Scanlan from the University’s Computational Engineering and Design Research group credits laser sintering for the achievement: The flexibility of the laser sintering process allows the design team to re-visit historical techniques and ideas that would have been prohibitively expensive using conventional manufacturing. One of these ideas involves the use of a Geodetic structure. This type of structure was initially developed by Barnes Wallis and famously used on the Vickers Wellington bomber which first flew in 1936. This form of structure is very stiff and lightweight, but very complex. If it was manufactured conventionally it would require a large number of individually tailored parts that would have to be bonded or fastened at great expense.

The Bitizen Confiugrator enables you to create and customize your very own, unique Bitizen without drawing a single pixel or creating a single shade. With the help of the game’s original graphics, I re-created every single element and accessoire included in the game and put them together in one package. You can choose clothes by toggling the visibility of various categories and change their color through a simple color chooser ― all shading is applied automatically. The layer preview on the right side of the image above displays a part of the available clothing items. A few little tips before you can get started:
♦ For convenience and better visibility, I tripled the image size. If you want to have the ‘real’ size back, change the image size back to 131 x 212 by using Nearest Neighbor as interpolation setting.
♦ To export your customized bitizen without the whole background around it, simply right-click the Bitizen folder inside Photoshop’s layer window and select Convert to Smart Object. Double click the resulting smart object and save the result through Save for Web and Devices. And now, go ahead and create you own, personal Bitizen, the possibilities are nearly endless! Enjoy Please keep in mind that the original graphics are property of NimbleBit; I have simply re-created those as ‘fan artwork’ and do not claim any ownership for the idea or actual Bitizen graphics used in this template.

Day-time highs of 40°C (112°F) are not unusual in Sevilla, Cordoba and other cities in the south of Spain during July and August. But the financial crisis that has plagued the country since 2008 is making scorching days much more unbearable for many more residents. Their situation draws attention to the reality that fuel poverty is not only about being 'COLD@HOME', in regions with cold winters and for people living in cooler homes, or only about long-standing root problems such as old, poorly constructed dwellings.

In this case, relatively new factors – high unemployment, austerity measures and reforms to energy policy and energy pricing – are putting people into a home-style pressure cooker when it comes to managing budgets and trying to keep adequately cool.

Between 2006 and 2012, the rate of Spanish households who couldn't afford adequate heating in winter rose from 6% to 9%; those in arrears on utility bills rose from 4% to 6%. Over the same period, a staggering 25% of households self-reported they could no longer afford to keep comfortably cool in summer.[1], [2] These percentages translate to 7 million people who live in unhealthy conditions, in homes that are very cold in winter and/or very hot in summer.

An annual 7 200 deaths can now be attributed to energy poverty in Spain, according to the World Health Organisation. In 2010, pre-mature deaths attributed to energy poverty exceeded those from car accidents.

Yet the issue of fuel poverty was largely unrecognised in Spain until the late 2000s, when a report published by the Asociación de Ciencias Ambientales identified improving the energy efficiency of homes as a potential means of stimulating employment (Tirado Herrero et al., 2012).[3] This report stimulated further investigation of the interplay of factors driving up fuel poverty in the country, finding that the economic crisis, unemployment and rising prices all played key roles, while geography and climate led to zones where the incidence of fuel poverty was particularly high. Action to address the situation are underway, but are less effective than they could be.

I want to share a 5-minute snippet from Sam Harris in his lecture “Death in the Present Moment”. I think Sam Harris expresses this truth exceptionally well, and it is more useful to take another listen than to hear me expound on it. However, I will say I think Sam Harris is right, in that there is probably nothing more important to understand about your mind than this if you want to be happy in this world.. I will also add that the ability to drop your problem and appreciate the intrinsically good experience of life moment to moment is a skill that can be honed, like any other, and the benefits of learning and developing this skill are unique in terms of how fruitful they can be in our day to day lives.

Circulating xanthine oxidase and neutrophil activation during human liver transplantation.
Oxygen free radicals, generated by xanthine oxidase (XO) and activated leukocytes, are involved in reperfusion injury in experimental liver transplantation. The roles of XO and neutrophil activation during reperfusion in clinical liver transplantation were studied. In 10 patients undergoing liver transplantation, we assessed plasma concentrations of circulating XO by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the purine metabolites hypoxanthine, xanthine, and urate by high-performance liquid chromatography, lactoferrin by ELISA, and malondialdehyde fluorometrically up to 48 hours postoperatively. During reperfusion after portal vein declamping, elevated plasma concentrations of XO (52.1 ng/mL [range, 8.0-440.1]), hypoxanthine (81.62 micromol/L [48.2-108.7]), xanthine (21.01 micromol/L [8.7-22.3]), and lactoferrin (532.6 ng/mL [370.4-1326.6]) were observed compared with the preoperative levels (0 ng/mL [0-12], 1.88 micromol/L [0.62-3.15], 0.95 micromol/L [0-0.41], and 164.3 ng/mL [73.7-334.1], respectively; all P < 0.05). No changes occurred in urate or malondialdehyde. After portal vein declamping, XO, hypoxanthine, and xanthine levels were substantially greater in the hepatic than portal vein (all P < 0.05). Marginal transhepatic differences occurred in lactoferrin. Reperfusion during liver transplantation is associated with liberation of xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine, and xanthine from the liver into the circulation. During reperfusion, intravascular neutrophil activation takes place in the hepatic circulation.

Why can’t I file a Change of Address with USPS for my VPM account?. USPS has set regulations when it comes to forwarding your mail.. Change of Address forwarding is a convenience service offered specifically by USPS, not by us. The postal service limits the forwarding option to residential addresses and certain commercial addresses only. It does not offer forwarding from a mail-receiving agent. This is because USPS does not sort mail based on the mailbox number that we assign to you; we do so on our end to make sure that your mail lands in your account.. In the USPS address database, our Mailbox location is listed as the final destination address for your VPM mail. So any mail going to this address is simply delivered to us. We are then responsible for internally sorting mail based on mailbox numbers and inducting items into our customers' accounts. Therefore, the postal service cannot recognize and forward mail for a specific mailbox number from our location to another address.

IT HAS taken a while, but this weekend Syria joined the list of Arab countries whose citizens have taken to the streets. After Friday prayers, protests were held in Damascus, the capital, as well as Banias, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Deraa in the south. The last of these was by far the best attended, with up to 2,000 people, according to eyewitnesses.The violence has since risen. Security forces attempting to control the crowds shot and killed at least four protesters. Then on Saturday a funeral for two of them turned into another protest, which was dispersed with tear gas and fire-engine hoses. Yesterday thousands marched again, calling for an end to 48 years of emergency law, and more freedoms. One person was reportedly shot. The BBC said buildings had been torched, including the headquarters of both the ruling Baath party and the Syriatel mobile network owned by Rami Makhlouf, the business-tycoon cousin of the president, whose wealth stirs much comment and resentment. Information is hard to come by: Deraa is in semi-lockdown. Nobody is allowed in and there have been interruptions to telephone and internet services.Syria has traditionally enjoyed a two-fold stability: it is one of the most authoritarian countries in the world and many on the streets like the president, Bashar Assad. These demonstrations mark the biggest unrest in the country since he inherited power from his father in 2000.Small protests started on Tuesday when a group gathered in the Hamidiyeh market in Damascus. On Wednesday, a silent sit-in by known activists demanding the release of political prisoners was violently dispersed. Since then the focus of the protests has changed, with momentum now coming from outside the capital and from the general public.Why Deraa? It is a sleepy city of around 300,000 some 100km (62 miles) south of Damascus in a tribal Sunni area of olive groves and farmland. The spark appears to have been the arrest of more than a dozen teenagers last week for painting anti-regime graffiti on a wall. Two women were subsequently arrested. With poverty levels also rising as water levels have dropped, local anger appears to have reached a tipping point.The government, previously adept at public relations, has floundered in its response. It has used force against its citizens and simultaneously accused infiltrators of dressing up as high-ranking officials and ordering forces to shoot. But it has also made concessions, reducing the duration of the loathed military service, releasing the teenagers and announcing an investigation. Faisal Kolthoum, Deraa's governor, has been removed from his post.There are signs the crisis in Deraa could be solved. A group of prominent locals has presented a list of demands to the government. These include the end to emergency law and the dismantling of the local security office, but not the removal of Mr Assad. Friday's protesters had different motives in different parts of the country. In other areas, such as quiet Damascus, many disbelieve the news leaking out or prefer to turn a blind eye. Some activists want to pull back, viewing the situation as a dangerously unarticulated barrage of anger. Dormant opposition figures are complicating matters by trying to enter the fray.But many of those who took to the streets were calling for revolution as well as protesting against corruption and abuses of power. As on Friday, small protests were reported elsewhere in the country again yesterday. Although there is no single organiser the Syria Revolution Facebook group had called for a “day of dignity” on Friday, but its influence has been limited until now. Activists have started to create information networks. More importantly perhaps, the fear that previously prevented political action has started to dissipate.Many want change in an orderly fashion. But a continued bungled, violent response by the government could change that. Syria's economic and political woes are similar to those lamented by protesters around the region: corruption, an exaggerated security presence, soaring prices and a lack of prospects for the country's burgeoning, and increasingly globally connected, youth.

The Market Potential For Privately Financed Long Term Care Products In The UK. Download Now Free registration required. Executive Summary. This paper considers the market potential for privately financed long term care products in the UK. It finds that since the present market is undeveloped there is scope to increase the range of products available to suit people with different means and circumstances. Currently the UK spends about ?19 billion on Long Term Care (LTC) of which around a third is privately funded and two thirds publicly funded. The paper finds that very few people can afford to pay for LTC out of their own pockets from income alone, but that this number is increased if savings are taken into account and significantly increased if housing wealth is included as well.. - Format: PDF. - Size: 712.9 KB

That was a beautiful Hawaiian blessings for actors, cast, crew and location principals. There was a sunrising ceremony, prayers for all welcoming in the new day and production bringing the ancestors of all present to guide everyone during this filming. Everyone took part in the prayers and in the end everyone went into the ocean for a ‘cleansing.’ They partook in the consumption of ceremony foods as they emerged from the ocean, warmed themselves and mingled with all present. Production caterer was there to provide everyone with a healthy breakfast before heading back ‘home’, hotels or wherever they’re staying for this production. Mahalo to Hi’ilawe Productions for allowing a blessing for a filming in Hawaii like none other. There were no ‘precedents’ comparable to this ever in all the filmmaking in Hawaii. Mahalo Cameron Crowe and all who made this possible. This is how EVERY film should begin so as to level the ‘playing field’ with ALL so to continue a harmonious relationship in a special place like Hawaii.

Ross.. Synopsis via BBC. Poldark gets better with every episode, episode 7 was just brilliant. The scenes cutting together towards the end showing the consequences of Demelza's actions was an inspired piece of theatre and the performance of the actors is of a consistently excellent standard. Here in Cornwall so many people are really enjoying this adaptation of what is a very special series of novels. Well done BBC.

Anita Wilkie. Hi Shiners!. I am so honoured to have been selected to review ShineOn items, for you! I am a 34-year-old Mum of two and an ex-Aucklander, who now lives in the Wairarapa. I am a full time Mum but also run my own small social media business, from home. I’ve been purchasing almost exclusively (my friends can attest!) from ShineOn for about five years and over that time have realised that my “style” would be street/casual for the most part - but I do love to change things up with some bright colours/prints now and then. My most coveted brands would be Home-Lee and Silent Theory but I love trying new things and matching them back with my relaxed style. I am quite self-conscious of my ‘mum-tum’ and really hunt out clothing that is going to flatter/hide it, whilst still looking on trend and being comfortable! I’m really excited to show you more of the beautiful pieces that the ShineOn buying team has chosen for you all!. You can find my posts by searching on VIP Group for Anita Wilkie

Q:

mysql primary key question

How optimal is it to have a primary key on 3 or 4 fields? If the table has say millions of records, is it going to be heavy on the server running a query such as:
Select * from my_table where field1='123' and field_2='123' and field_3='hours'

The primary key is created on these fields:
field_1 int(11)
field_2 int(11)
field_3 varchar(20)
What I'm considering doing as an alternative is have those fields store the data with a primary key on a separate field which has an md5 hash of the data such as "md5(field_1+'-'+field_2+'-'+field_3) and then my script just queries one field such as:
Select * from my_table where field_hash=MD5('123-123-hours')

So basically I'm just wondering if method 1 is just as optimal as method 2 with a table with millions of records.

A:

You can read about the composite key performance from the answers to question Composite Primary Key performance drawback in MySQL
Before doing this kind of optimization, you should always measure the effects. That is, create two tables with the same data, one using composite key and the other the hash, and try which one works better in you use case. 
In general, I don't like using nonsensical key values if not absolutely necessary. If the hash is used as the primary key it means that the user of the database must be aware of the ID generation process. This leads to more documentation, that will not be read, and errors in the long run. 
Instead of using the  composite key you might want to see, if there is a possibility of normalizing your database further. Does the composite key represent a different entity and should it actually form an second table where you can attach a surrogate key to the set of columns? 
Another option is to use a surrogate key in the current table and then place a unique constraint to the current composite key e.g.

- Congo, Democratic Republic. - Conflicts and Disasters.  them happy. Business is not good these days. Because of the war it’s dangerous to farm.”. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is extremely lush and fertile, but the conflict and obstructions like checkpoints, where farmers are forced to pay bribes to get to markets, mean farmers like Mumburi can’t produce as much food as they could. The brutal conflict, along with decades of government failures and foreign interventions have taken their toll. Since 1998 an estimated 5.4 million people have died because of the violence, endemic poverty and preventable diseases.. Take Action!. Sadly, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is not the only country where conflict has taken a horrendous toll. The ongoing violence in Yemen is making an already dire humanitarian situation worse. We must push for a permanent and immediate ceasefire.. Photo: Eleanor Farmer/Oxfam. -. {headline}

A San Diego County woman in her 50s is the first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 in the region, the Health and Human Services Agency announced today.

The woman developed symptoms after traveling overseas. The woman was hospitalized and remains at a local hospital in isolation with serious symptoms.

Her test results came back positive late this afternoon at the County Public Health Laboratory, which is sending specimens to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for final confirmation.

HHSA is aggressively working to find out where she had been prior to being hospitalized and how many people had close contact with her. The appropriate people will be placed under self-quarantine and monitored for possible symptoms of COVID-19.

“We knew we would see cases in San Diego County and were prepared for them,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The public should be assured that we are following CDC guidance and continue taking appropriate steps to keep the novel coronavirus from spreading.”

Symptoms of COVID-19

Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection have reported symptoms ranging from mild to severe respiratory illness. Symptoms generally include:

fever

cough

shortness of breath/difficulty breathing

At this time, the CDC believes that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days, or as long as 14 days, after exposure.

Through March 9, HHSA had placed 76 patients under investigation. Fifty-six have tested negative and 19 are pending. A total 464 people have been placed under self-quarantine at home, 376 have finished their quarantine and 82 are currently being monitored. Six people ended up developing symptoms and became patients under investigation.

“We are monitoring these people daily and taking appropriate actions when they develop symptoms,” Wooten said. “It’s important to remember that if you did not have close contact

to the patient with COVID-19 or someone who’s traveled to an impacted country or region, the risk of infection is still low.”

What Residents Can Do to Prepare for COVID-19

It’s important for the public to be prepared should a COVID-19 outbreak occur in San Diego County. To limit the spread of infection, you should:

Wash your hands often to help protect you from germs.

Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available. It should contain at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

If you are sick, stay home and keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.

Practice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.

Residents should also follow these important tips to help prepare to respond to this public health threat.

Store a two-week supply of food, beverages and water, including food for family pets. Ensure an adequate supply of prescribed and routine medications are on hand.

Plan ways to care for those who are at greater risk for serious complications and who will take care of sick family members.

If you have family members with increased risk of getting seriously sick, check with your medical providers about symptoms and treatment.

Create an emergency contact list of family and friends, teachers and employers.

Have a plan in case your school, child care, or employer closes temporarily.

Talk with your children, family, and friends about what to do if an outbreak occurs and what each person would need.

Planning now helps you act more effectively to protect you and your family if COVID-19 does spread locally.

If you have individual questions, please talk to your health care provider. For community resources, please call 2-1-1 San Diego or visit 211sandiego.org. or coronavirus-sd.com.

At the end of 2018, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez declared that self-care wouldn’t just be a priority, but a nonnegotiable as she braced herself to become the youngest woman ever elected to the U.S. Congress. And just weeks into her term, the 29-year-old trailblazer is underlining that skin care is an integral part of her approach to the high-stakes pressures of being in office.

Last night, when Ocasio-Cortez opened up her Instagram to questions, a follower—one also well-versed in the exhaustive demands of political campaigns—asked how she stays both stress- and breakout-free. After clarifying that she, despite her optimistic disposition, is as stress-stricken as anyone who’s just run a congressional campaign, Ocasio-Cortez revealed that she’s able to maintain a healthy glow by doing her due diligence when she shops for new products.

“Skin care is straight-up a hobby of mine,” she explained on her Instagram Stories. “I’m a science nerd and I truly enjoy the science of it, reading about compounds and studies. It’s like that.” Another major influence for Ocasio-Cortez has been her mother, who she says used to break out a lot in her twenties and has imparted wisdom accordingly. “She taught me since I was a kid not to touch my face,” she explained.

Making a point to highlight that everyone’s skin is different and ever-evolving, she divulged that she considers her personal approach a blend between K-beauty and scientific consensus, and that she likes to experiment with specialized tools and treatments, such as face masks and under-eye patches. Ocasio-Cortez’s most enthusiastic recommendation? Cleansing your skin at the end of the day—even if you have to hack it. “If you’re layering your face in makeup day after day (which is totally fine!) make sure you clean or wipe your skin early when you get home so it has time to rest,” she explains, adding that she always keeps wipes next to her bed just in case. But so long as she has the energy, Ocasio-Cortez partakes in a multistep skin-care regimen. “I do indulge [in skin care] a little since I don’t buy a lot of makeup beyond my staples,” she says.

Breaking down her daily routine into three steps, she begins by double cleansing with a balm or oil to melt off makeup, before using a a more traditional face wash to lift all other impurities. Next up are the more potent elixirs, like a gentle, nourishing toner to balance her skin’s pH before she layers on supercharged serums with active ingredients such as brightening vitamin C and anti-aging retinol. Finally, she finishes things off with a moisturizer carefully tailored to her skin and, the most important step of all, sunscreen. “I’ve been using daily sunscreen since I was 19,” she explains. “I’ve been bad about it lately and can tell the difference.”

The country-less virtual currency bitcoin has soared in value in recent weeks. But lost in all the talk of a bitcoin bubble is whether the digital denomination is useful for more than just a novelty investment. What can you actually use it for? To prove the new currency has practical value a group of online retailers and bitcoin are offering Black Friday deals.

Getty Images

The group created an online deal site, BitcoinBlackFriday, to help consumers spend their bitcoin. The site first went live last year with just 74 merchants, but this year the site already has over 200 participating retailers, and is targeting a total 500 this year. “Most merchants sign up the day before Black Friday and on Black Friday itself,” says John Holmquist, founder of Bitcoin Black Friday. The site will offer discounts on everything from dating site OkCupid and CheapAir.com to handmade American rugs and Christmas trees. One retailer – the family-run Bees Brothers – is luring customers with a 20% discount on honey.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency that doesn’t require a bank or Treasury Department. Its value has risen to around $808 from below $50 in March and $10.50 two years ago. MtGox.com (short for Magic the Gathering Online Exchange), the main exchange for users swapping Bitcoins, handles around 80% of all Bitcoin trade and charges 0.25% to 0.60% for its brokerage services, depending on the size of the trade. There are around 12 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to BitcoinCharts.com.

Last week, bitcoin investors were encouraged by comments from some senior U.S. law-enforcement and regulatory officials who said they saw benefits in digital currency. In testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Mythili Raman, acting assistant attorney general for the department’s criminal division, said: “The Department of Justice recognizes that many virtual currency systems offer legitimate financial services and have the potential to promote more efficient global commerce.”

Even so, experts say the biggest risk for bitcoin remains political. “There’s a chance that Congress could pass legislation that makes it much less useful,” says Holmes Wilson, co-founder of Internet activist group Fight for the Future and participant in Bitcoin Black Friday. “The response to that challenge is to make bitcoin as popular as we can as fast as we can.” (Consumers can buy bitcoin from CoinBase.com in the U.S. Before CoinBase, Holmquist says it was “technical nightmare” to buy bitcoin.)

There is already a brisk — if narrow — trade in bitcoin. Justin O’Connell, CEO of GoldSilverBitcoin.com, says he conducts approximately $15,000 in bitcoin trades a day. “A lot of people who got into the bitcoin market earlier are switching them into silver and gold,” he says. “They are taking advantage of the high bitcoin prices and low silver and gold prices.” The recent slump in the silver and gold prices has created opportunities for bitcoinites. “We accept bitcoins for metals and metals for bitcoins,” he says.

Bitcoin: Is the Currency Becoming More Real?

Some venues are also offering Bitcoin Black Friday deals. EVR bar and lounge in New York recently started accepting bitcoin for drinks and food. On Black Friday, it will offer a “buy one drink and get one free” deal and half-price bottles of beer at EVR if they pay with bitcoin, says Charlie Shrem, a partner at the venue. Shrem is also CEO of BitInstant, a company that facilitates the retail purchase of Bitcoins at over 700,000 locations throughout the U.S. and co-chairman of The Bitcoin Foundation, which aims to standardize, protect and promote Bitcoin. “It’s a nonpolitical online money backed exclusively by code and it’s only as good as its cryptography and math.”

E-commerce sites were among the first to accept the currency. The publishing software company WordPress accepts bitcoin for features that are dependent on credit-card and PayPal payment systems; PayPal, it says, blocks access to certain countries. The social network Reddit accepts them for its premium service, as do Web-hosting company BTCWebHost.com, SurvivalCampingStore.com and online gaming site Minethings.com. Consumers can spend a fraction of a bitcoin too: It’s divisible to the eighth decimal place. It’s also possible to purchase clothing, cigars, and various goods and services with bitcoin. See a complete list of merchants.

Bitcoins could flourish in underground economies, among individuals hoping to avoid taxes or buy illegal drugs, says Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, D.C. “The more likely adoption path is not through the wealthy West but through economies where banking systems are weak, seizure of wealth is common and political systems are more unstable,” he says. Because people can use just a fraction of a Bitcoin for payment, however, he says they are also ideal for micropayments. “Want to listen to a song online?” he says. “Pay 3 cents to do it.”

Founded in 2009 by a developer (or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto, it’s still early days for the virtual currency. “It’s a very, very high level experiment,” says Ari Zoldan, CEO of technology and media company Quantum Networks in New York. For people purchasing goods and services online, however, he says it could potentially change the entire currency landscape and “be to regular currency what Skype was to the telephone industry.” Instead of trusting central banks or governments to safe keep your money, he says, “it shifts that responsibility to individuals.” Built-in limitations to the bitcoin protocol states that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin by 2140. “The bitcoin protocol is like a card game,” Holmquist says, “but you don’t have access to every single card in the deck.”

Given the currency’s meteoric rise, some critics have expressed concerns about a bitcoin bubble. And, despite the rhetoric at the congressional hearing on virtual currencies last week, the government has thus far given them as much recognition as it does to Monopoly money: Not much. And most brick-and-mortar companies on Main Street still prefer plastic or dollars. Despite his own foray into bitcoin, Shrem doesn’t expect other businesses to follow his lead — yet. “Brick and mortar companies are going to be the last one to accept bitcoin,” he says, “especially the mom and pop stores.”

NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - Stocks futures took a tumble following worse than expected August jobs data. September S&P futures were down 5.10 at 1,023.10 and Nasdaq 100 futures were 7.00 lower at 1,368.00, vs. pre-data declines of about 2.70 and 1.10, respectively. The weak data also lit a fire under bonds, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TNX, -0.09% falling 0.09 percentage points to 4.423 percent. Non-farm payrolls declined 93,000, vs. consensus economist expectations for an increase of about 19,000.

Description

Hand splitter Wedges and shims / Plugs and feathers are tools designed to split rock when driven into a drilled hole or natural crack. The wedge fits in the hole between two feathers whose flat sides form a guide that prevents the wedge from jamming as it is driven into the hole.

Use wedge and feathers as follows:

Position the feathers in the hole so the flat sides of the wedge will be parallel to the line along which the break will occur.

Drive the wedge into the slot between the feathers until the rock cracks, or until it sticks in the rock.

Then tap the wedge lightly back and forth along the inside edges of the feathers until it is freed.

Remove the wedge and, if necessary, begin again.

Proceed slowly to allow the tools time to do their work.

To be effective, wedges and feathers must be correctly sized. The diameter of the wedge rod and feathers at the point where the rod meets the feathers must exceed the diameter of the hole. Driving the wedge between the feathers forces them against the sides of the hole and splits the rock.

Avoid unnecessary stresses on wedges and feathers by drilling holes as straight as possible. Straight holes help keep wedges and feathers from binding or jamming in the hole.

Q:

Reading a list of integer in a single input line in C++

I'm trying to read multiple integers from a single input line into an array
eg. Input: 100 200 300 400, so the array is: a[0] = 100, a[1] = 200, a[2] = 300, a[3] = 400
The thing is, the number of integers are unknown, so the size of the array is unknown.

A:

You should use a container that automatically resizes itself, such as std::vector.
For example, something like this:
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <utility>
#include <iterator>

std::string line;
getline(instream, line);
std::istringstream this_line(line);
std::istream_iterator<int> begin(this_line), end;
std::vector<int> values(begin, end);

A:

You could use std::vector for this:
std::vector<int> myVector;

std::string line;
std::getline(std::cin, line);
std::istringstream os(line);

int i;
while(os >> i)
    myVector.push_back(i);

This code requires following includes: <iostream>, <string>, <sstream> and <vector>.

Cicerone Theodorescu

Cicerone Theodorescu (February 9, 1908 – February 18, 1974) was a Romanian poet.

Born in Bucharest, his father was a laborer for Căile Ferate Române state railway. After attending high school in his native city, he studied at the literature and philosophy department of the University of Bucharest. He then taught in various high schools and worked as an editor and reporter. A contributor to the left-wing press, he signed, together with other pro-democracy intellectuals, protests against the country's drift toward fascism. After the King Michael Coup of 1944, Theodorescu held important posts at Centrala Cărții publishing overseer, was vice president of the Romanian Writers' Society from 1944 and editor-in-chief of Viața Românească magazine from 1948.

Theodorescu made his literary debut in 1925 in Perpessicius' Universul literar; he subsequently published in Azi, Credința, Cuvântul, Cuvântul liber, Facla, Lumea, Sinteza, Gazeta literară, Viața Românească, Vremea, Zodiac, România Literară and Luceafărul. His first book was the 1936 Cleștar, described by Ovid S. Crohmălniceanu as "enclosing the soul's turmoil in glacial, pellucid verses, slowly carved with a jeweler's care". He drew particular notice for his verses inspired from the work and suffering of railwaymen. His other volumes followed the same direction (including Cântece de galeră, 1946; Focul din amnar, 1946; Un cântec din ulița noastră, 1953, State Prize). However, with time, his lyricism tended toward the epic or became anemic, and remained lively only in the collections of fixed-form poems such as rondels. His later books included Poteca lunii, 1964; Hronic, 1965; Zburătorul din larg, 1965; Țărmul singuratic, 1968; Platoșa duratei, 1973 and Nebunul regelui, 1976. In 1971-1972, near the end of his life, he spent lengthy periods in Rome, writing a poem about Trajan that remains unpublished.

Theodorescu translated widely, in particular Soviet literature (Vladimir Mayakovsky, Aleksandr Tvardovsky), but also authors who included William Blake, Jérôme Carcopino and Lino Curci. He collected folklore (Izvoare fermecate, 1958) and wrote prolifically for children, although some of these works are now irrecoverable. He sometimes used the pen names Radu Lăncieru, Victor Sângeru, C. Tudor and C. Tudoran.

DELIVERY LEAD TIMES FOR NEW METAL BUILDINGS. When making a new purchase of a metal building, delivery and installation – when you finally get to see your metal structure on your property – it’s an exciting time! We know and understand that, which is why we’re continually working to decrease our lead times. We design, craft, and schedule the installation team for each order, so there are times when customers may experience longer than normal lead times, though we do strive to reduce these time frames.. On average, customers can expect lead times of 2 – 4 weeks, which allows us the time we need to create each metal building to the exact specifications our customer’s request. Our sales representatives work closely with each customer to clearly communicate which stage of the construction process we’re in, and when they can expect their delivery.. The current lead time is 2 – 4 weeks.

Q:

problem involving continuity and sequences.

Please, help me to solve this problem.
$f\colon[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb R$ continuous and $ \forall n, \exists x_n \in [a,b]$, such that
 $|f(x_n) - x_n|< \frac{1}{n}$. Prove that $ \exists x \in [a,b]$ such that $f(x)=x$.

A:

The obvious thing to do is consider the sequence $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$. Since this sequence is bounded, it has a subsequence that converges to some $x_\infty$. Since $[a,b]$ is closed, this limit $x_\infty$ is also in $[a,b]$. Assume $f(x_\infty)\ne x_\infty$. Then find a term $x_n$ of the subsequence converging to $x_\infty$ with $\frac1n<\frac12|f(x_\infty)-x_\infty|$ and $|x_n-x_\infty|<\frac12|f(x_\infty)-x_\infty|$ to arrive at a contradiction.

The fact that so many computers remained vulnerable two months after the release of a patch illustrates this aspect. As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, there is simply no way for customers to protect themselves against threats unless they update their systems. Otherwise they’re literally fighting the problems of the present with tools from the past.

It applies in the field of antenna processing, where the signals originating from one or more emitters (sources) are received on a system of several sensors. The sources are received at different angles of incidence.
In an electromagnetic context, the sensors are antennas and the sources emit a polarized radioelectric signal. In an acoustic context the sensors are microphones and the sources are sound sources.
The sensors of the array receive the sources with a phase and an amplitude dependent on their angle of incidence as well as on the position of the antennas in terms of narrowband, plane wavefront and with no perturbations on the reception channels and the sensors of the array.
The antenna processing techniques currently known have the principal objective of utilizing spatial diversity. More particularly, the direction finding or locating of sources has the objective of estimating the angles of incidence of the emitters on the basis of an array of sensors.
In a nominal fashion, the direction finding procedures like MUSIC [1] assume that the wavefront is plane, that the sources are narrowband, point sources, with no polarization diversity, no coherent path and no disturbance of the response of the sensor array to a source. When one of these suppositions does not hold, the response of the array of sensors to a source no longer depends solely on the incidence but on other parameters such as the bandwidth, the coupling coefficients, the width of the diffusion cone or else the source-sensor distance.
The prior art describes various techniques making it possible to compensate for some of these disturbances. The estimation of the secondary parameters (parameters other than the incidence) is not envisaged in most techniques with the exception of reference [2] for polarization diversity. Techniques thus exist which adapt direction finding algorithms to diffuse sources [3][4][5]. For the wideband context, there exist focusing techniques [6][7] or spatio-frequency techniques [8][9][10][11]. For the techniques for compensating for the distortions of the response of the array the literature is very rich [12][13] etc.
In the prior art the techniques for compensating for the distortions of the response of the array of sensors process each of the disturbances in an isolated fashion without however taking account of several disturbances at one and the same time. Such techniques therefore turn out to be inadequate, in particular, in numerous acoustic applications where the wave is at one and the same time wideband and received as a curved wavefront. For radioelectric sources, it is possible to have an antenna array disturbed by coupling with polarization diversity waves and coherent paths.

Vast View, Fine Attention. In this session, Martin explores the apparent paradox of a vast view combined with a fine attention, along with practices to bring both into focus. How do we hold both simultaneously? How can we be responsive, without feeling responsible? How might we bring both a vast view and a fine attention to both our inner practices, and to our outer engagement, whether in our personal lives or in response to the ecological, political and social crises in which we currently find ourselves?

Multiagent learning can be seen as applying ML techniques to the core issues of multiagent systems, like communication, coordination, and competition. In this paper, we address the issue of learning from communication among agents circumscribed to a scenario with two agents that (1) work in the same domain using a shared ontology, (2) are capable of learning from examples, and (3) communicate using an argumentative framework. We will present a two fold approach consisting of (1) an argumentation framework for learning agents, and (2) an individual policy for agents to generate arguments and counterarguments (including counterexamples). We focus on argumentation between two agents, presenting (1) an interaction protocol (AMAL2) that allows agents to learn from counterexamples and (2) a preference relation to determine the joint outcome when individual predictions are in contradiction. We present several experiment to asses how joint predictions based on argumentation improve over individual agent’s prediction.

Abstract

We propose a face alignment framework that relies on the texture model generated by the responses of discriminatively trained part-based filters. Unlike standard texture models built from pixel intensities or responses generated by generic filters (e.g. Gabor), our framework has two important advantages. Firstly, by virtue of discriminative training, invariance to external variations (like identity, pose, illumination and expression) is achieved. Secondly, we show that the responses generated by discriminatively trained filters (or patch-experts) are sparse and can be modeled using a very small number of parameters. As a result, the optimization methods based on the proposed texture model can better cope with unseen variations. We illustrate this point by formulating both part-based and holistic approaches for generic face alignment and show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art on multiple ”wild” databases. The code and dataset annotations are available for research purposes from http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources.

Cambridgeshire: First Areas Get Superfast Broadband

25 November 2013, 06:00

Superfast broadband has arrived in rural Cambridgeshire under the Connecting Cambridgeshire programme, with the first areas going live from this morning.

An early Christmas present for communities around the county, the switch-on heralds the start of the Connecting Cambridgeshire high speed fibre broadband roll-out across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

Connecting Cambridgeshire is celebrating the first of many new fibre broadband cabinets to go live by unveiling a new green cabinet in the rural village of Grafham, near Huntingdon.

The roadside cabinet is one of ten new cabinets around the county being connected to the fibre network, bringing opportunities for thousands of homes and businesses to benefit from high speed Internet access.

New cabinets will also be going live from today in parts of Buckden, Cambridge (Coleridge and Queen Edith's), Offord D'Arcy, St Ives, Somersham and Whittlesey - extending the existing fibre coverage delivered under BT's commercial plans - with many more to follow over the next two years.

More than 1,500 homes and businesses linked to these cabinets will be able to receive faster broadband speeds of 24Mbps and higher before Christmas by upgrading to superfast broadband with their chosen service provider.

Leader of Cambridgeshire County Council, Councillor Martin Curtis, will cut the ribbon on the new Grafham cabinet on behalf of the Connecting Cambridgeshire programme alongside Huntingdonshire MP Jonathan Djanogly and Bill Murphy, Managing Director of Next Generation Access for BT, one of the major partners in the programme.

The high speed connection will be welcomed by many Grafham residents, including home-based businesses, who have strongly supported the county-wide campaign for better broadband encouraged by local Broadband Champions Chris Bulow and Alastair Brydon.

Leader of Cambridgeshire County Council, Councillor Martin Curtis said: "Our Connecting Cambridgeshire superfast broadband programme has had fantastic support from all over Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. We know many people have been eagerly anticipating the first phase of the roll-out since the signing of the contract with BT in March. I am delighted that we have achieved our promise to see our investment start delivering fibre broadband for homes and businesses before the end of this year.

"We are on track for fibre based broadband to be available to 98% of premises by the end of December 2015, which will make Cambridgeshire one of the best connected counties in the country. Faster connectivity will transform the way people can work and do business, as well as improving access to vital services, which will boost rural communities like Grafham."

Huntingdonshire MP Jonathan Djanogly said: "This project will be hugely welcomed by my constituents who live and work in the connected villages. Fibre broadband in rural areas is all about enabling people to operate more efficiently. As such, I see this initiative as a vital and welcome development towards sustaining rural communities."

Bill Murphy, Managing Director of Next Generation Access for BT, said: "It is a fantastic achievement that people in Cambridgeshire are already seeing the benefits of this programme. This investment in fibre broadband will boost the local economy and help to create or protect local jobs both in communities like Grafham and across the whole of Cambridgeshire. It will be of enormous benefit to local businesses which can use the faster speeds to improve their competitiveness both within the UK and abroad."

Communications Minister Ed Vaizey said: "People in Cambridgeshire are now seeing real results from our broadband programme. For the first time homes and business in Grafham have access to superfast broadband and the many benefits it can bring for work, entertainment and doing business. Investing in superfast broadband will deliver real economic benefits. An expert report* revealed that for every £1 we are investing in broadband, the UK economy will benefit by £20."

I've seen this popping up on quite a few blogs. I thought I'd repost it because before I left Australia my mum made me make a pile of stuff to take if the house was going to burn down/they got evacuated. I live on a river in Sydney near a lot of bushland and bush fires have always been a threat. She also made me do this the year before when I went to London over the Australian summer time. Back to this. It's a sweet/sort of sad project and gives real insight into what people treasure vs what they think they'll need. I know my collection included photographs, my hard-drive, artworks, my favourite cd, my favourite shoes, special things that would only mean something to me and lots of other objects... knowing that hopefully my parents would also pick up my dogs too. I thought it would be mean to lock them in a box for a year just in case the house might burn down!. Via The Burning House

Chile-Hong Kong FTA Enters into Force. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA), signed by Chile and Hong Kong, China in 2012, will enter into force on 9 October 2014. The agreement governs a wide range of issues including trade in goods and services, investment, government procurement, competition, and other related areas. With respect to investments, the FTA provides for national treatment in specified non-services sectors, alongside the provisions in the trade in services chapter that apply to investments in service sectors. The parties to the agreement have agreed to negotiate a separate and comprehensive agreement on investment promotion and protection upon the FTA’s entry into force.

In a move that could compromise ethereum’s long-held dominance as the world’s top platform for smart-contract development, blockchain interoperability project Cosmos will offer users the choice to code in at least three different programming languages.

The first language to be supported on Cosmos is called Ethermint, a direct replica of ethereum’s smart contract language Solidity. Aimed at making it easier for ethereum developers to port their applications to the Cosmos network, the Ethermint project has been in the works since as early as 2016, said Zaki Manian of Tendermint, the company that built Cosmos.

The second coding language, called Secure EcmaScript (SES), is a version of JavaScript built for secure smart contract deployment by blockchain startup Agoric. Once the native Cosmos Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is fleshed out, the Agoric blockchain and its SES programming language will be easily accessible to Cosmos users, said Agoric CEO Dean Tribble.

Last but not least, JP Morgan blockchain spin-off Kadena announced Tuesday it too would be building a version of its native smart-contract language, Pact, for the Cosmos ecosystem. Its entrant to the Cosmos coding arms race is called Kadenamint.

“We’re committing to getting an industry-level smart contract language on [Cosmos] to give developers more deployment choices,” Kadena founder Stuart Popejoy told CoinDesk.

According to Popejoy, the comparative strengths of Kadenamint outperform that of Ethermint in every way.

“We see Pact as the standard for smart contract languages because Pact is just better than Solidity,” Popejoy said, adding:

“Every single developer that comes to use it gets things done faster. It’s safer. We have formal verification baked into the language. It’s designed for safety.”

In all fairness, ethereum developers are well aware of the limitations of Solidity and the virtual machine built to execute Solidity’s code. Called eWASM, the next major ethereum upgrade dubbed ethereum 2.0 will replace ethereum’s virtual machine and enable developers to code in multiple different programming languages.

Even so, Popejoy remained skeptical about eWASM and ethereum 2.0 saying the criticisms of ethereum’s virtual machine and Solidity “could have been addressed a long time ago” but weren’t – due to poor leadership.

“I wouldn’t consider them competitors but as it is, I consider them legacy,” said Popejoy about ethereum. “They did a good job in getting smart contracts out there and getting people thinking about it but that’s going to be a footnote.”

New competition

The new competitors differ from Solidity by placing a stronger emphasis on security as opposed to immutability and unstoppability.

“We’re building a platform with a security model that normal developers can understand,” said Agoric’s Tribble. “To us, the biggest problem with ethereum and Solidity is they have the wrong security model. Even security experts can’t get it right.”

Unlike Solidity, both Pact and SES employ an object-capability security model. This means that permissions in a smart contract can be dynamically and rapidly updated to give users access to different parts of application data in a safe way.

Tribble describes the model similar to being able to give your car keys over to a valet without also handing over the rights to car ownership.

Said Tribble:

“That’s typical of identity-based access control where the model of security used is such that the authority that I’m able to give you is either too much or too little. It’s not appropriate for the business interaction we’re trying to have.”

In Tribble’s view, porting object-capability security to smart contracts is the kind of innovation that will signal to the rest of the mainstream developer community that the blockchain industry is ready for mass adoption.

“For mainstream folks, having people that are addressing different parts of the market and visibly overlapping as competitors is actually healthy,” said Tribble. “That means there’s a real market.”

From the perspective of Manian, Cosmos is the ecosystem that can support and host this fast-growing market for smart contracts and decentralized application development. At the same time, he warns that in his view, Cosmos will not and simply cannot replace ethereum entirely because ethereum is much more than a technology.

“Ethereum is so much more than software. Ethereum, the ethereum community, the users of the ethereum blockchain, the faith people have in the core developers. All of that is wrapped up into one thing and that is the ethereum user experience,” Manian said, adding:

“We’re just creating new developer possibilities.”

Project Summary/Abstract The identification of environmental factors such as commensal bacterial metabolites that modulate immune responses could provide therapeutic targets for immune-driven diseases. Indeed T helper 17 (Th17) cells, a major immune cell type involved in autoimmunity, are regulated by the microbiota. Our long-term goal is to identify immune-modulatory members of the microbiota and understand the mechanisms whereby they influence the immune system in diverse environmental contexts. Here, we propose a distinct mechanism of microbial-driven Th17 induction where resident gut bacteria produce metabolites that traverse the gut barrier resulting in Th17 activation. Moreover, we hypothesize that this immune manipulation is altered by the diet. These hypotheses stem from our preliminary studies on the prevalent gut bacteria, Eggerthella lenta, whose levels are increased in patients with the Th17 driven disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We found that E. lenta colonization induces Th17 cells and contributes to more severe colitis in a gnotobiotic mouse model. Critically, high arginine conditions lead to decreased activity of an E. lenta-metabolizing enzyme, Cgr2, and our initial studies indicate that high Arg decreases E. lenta-mediated Th17 induction in a Cgr2 dependent manner. Based on these preliminary findings we propose to 1) Identify the mechanism by which E. lenta induces Th17 cells 2) Determine the influence of E. lenta colonization on mouse models of RA and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 3) Assess the effect of dietary Arg on E. lenta?s induction of Th17 cells and autoimmunity. By manipulating Cgr2 though heterologous expression and natural E. lenta strain variants that possess or lack Cgr2, we will investigate the role of this bacterial protein in Th17 induction. To identify the bacterial product produced by E. lenta responsible for Th17 induction we will perform mass spectrometry on HPLC fractionated E. lenta conditioned media, which we have shown to have Th17 inducing capabilities compared to a media control. Further, we will examine if E. lenta?s induction of autoimmunity is altered by dietary conditions using mouse models of RA and IBD and high and low Arg diets. These studies will provide insight into unique mechanisms of Th17 induction and examine how dietary alteration and bacterial metabolites affect autoimmunity. Our novel approach of investigating immune regulation with a microbial-centric perspective will aid in uncovering new mechanisms of immune regulation where the dietary alterations of immune-active microbial metabolites could provide effective therapy. These proposed studies will provide a rich training experience where our multidisciplinary approach will supply exceptional opportunities to expand skills in microbiology, microbiota studies, immunology, and biochemistry. We believe the outstanding research climate at UCSF of collaboration and expertise in these fields will steer this project and training to success.

Q:

Run command through a c# socket

I'm writing a c# application which connects to a remote server for doing stuff.
I'm already able to copy files to the client, and what I wish to do now, after I finished copying all the files is send a "command signal" through my Socket, and make the client run it.
Just for the example, this is what I wish to do:
string cmD = @"\\192.168.0.1\\cmd";
byte[] clientData = new byte[8000];
clientData = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(cmD);
clientSock.Send(clientData);

Let's assume that clientSock is the static Socket connected to my server.
In this case, I would like to run "cmd" on the client side.
Any ideas?

A:

In the end, you have not asked anything. Could you please detail what exactly would you like to ask?
Anyway, I guess you are trying to run a command in the remote server so, you will have to implement it in your C# server. To run commands, you can use Process::Start() method. Good luck!
Cheers,

Three teenagers are in jail Wednesday night, accused in a series of recent armed home and auto burglaries in Mandarin are in custody, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.

Police said Benjamin Huger, Dakota Harney and Deja Terry, all 18 years old, were seen on surveillance video entering a home on Canopy Oaks Drive at 4:30 a.m. Monday. According to police, the victim woke up to find one of the suspects standing over him in his bedroom. Once the suspect realized the victim was awake, the young man fled the residence.

The three are accused of taking a handgun and cellphone.

Police say they also rummaged through unlocked vehicles at the home, but nothing was taken.

News4Jax showed doorbell surveillance video Monday night of someone with a gun walking up to the front door of a Mandarin home. Police said that was Harney.

The Sheriff's Office said two fingerprints lifted from the scene matched those for Huger. During an interview, Huger told officer that he and friends were out celebrating his birthday car hopping. They found an unlocked garage door, unlocked vehicles in the garage and an unlocked door entering the house.

According to police, Huger admitted to taking the handgun from the victim’s nightstand while the victim slept next to it. Officers said the stolen handgun was recovered.

Investigation led to the identification of Terry and Harney as the other suspects.

Haney and Huger were also charged with vehicle burglary in a separate incident on Lazarette Court, also in Mandarin.

Summer Bock

Summer Bock is a FermentationistTM and founder of Guts and Glory, an online company dedicated to providing
clients with the knowledge and actionable skills to heal their digestive issues naturally. Her practice is
based on the premise that good health starts in the gut. She is a trained herbalist with a background in
microbiology and is certified by Columbia University in Integrative Nutrition.

Are you ready to learn several ways to get a balanced biome naturally using food? Here’s what you’ll get:

Investigate the most popular probiotic food sources and where to get them so you can help your family, friends, and clients achieve a better belly.

Since not all fermented foods are created equal, you’ll learn the important categories of fermented foods so you can make the best choices for repopulating your microbiome.

Which probiotic species you cannot supplement or replace with store-bought ferments (and must make at home).

How to get more than just probiotics from something that takes 15 minutes to make. (Hint: It has natural antimicrobial properties to crush the critters and balance the biome).

How to turn your passion for gut healing into a business that changes lives.

Successful Students, Just Like You

Don't take our word for it — check out some of the results our students have gotten from the Fermentationist Certification Program:

Oh my gosh, Summer is a wealth of knowledge, which is awesome. If you want to learn about fermenting this program gets you a really good base of knowledge about fermentation, the history of fermentation, the science of fermentation, and the use of ferments. It is applicable to health, because we learn so much of the health benefits, too. I think it's so important to learn this information and this program is a great place to do it. You can take this just for yourself even if you don’t have clients. All you really need is an interest in fermentation and the program provides all the rest — enthusiastic & inspiring community that doesn’t let you fall behind, a program that is faced-paced, but doable even with a full-schedule, and easy to follow lessons that give you a solid base for teaching, experimenting with, and building a health coaching practice with a focus on fermented foods to build gut health. The price of the program is totally fair and the payments are really helpful.

— Jenny Pandol, Health Coach, FCP Beta

In the end I signed up because I could sense a level integrity and passion from Summer that I want to be around. From a couple of conversations with her, as well as her past students, I came to a place of trust that I was/am in the right place at the right time with it all. I think Summer’s teaching style is sincere and fairly dynamic. She loves what she teaches and it shows. She listens with heart/shen and that is hard to find that in a teacher. I can for sure say that I would recommend Summer hands down as a passionate trailblazer in this arena in anyone who asks.

I signed up for this program because I prefer TIME TESTED modalities of healing. I learn best by being told the details of why things work. I’m not likely to do something if someone is telling me what to do without explaining it. Summer is great at sharing the scientific reasons why, which gets me motivated to share this work with my clients. Her wit, energy, and devotion to this teaching is thorough! Summer helps me feel like I’m a part of the group (that I do offer something and need to keep showing up). IF you have internet there is a lot of support and more to the program than simply learning ferments, which is GREAT!

— Nicole Wirth, Lymphatic Specialist and MediCupping

I’m here because I wanted to learn how to ferment. My son sent me Summer’s link on the computer and I checked it out and I was hooked! I got connected with Summer and we had a conversation and I thought ‘well, I’m not a practitioner and I don’t have clients but I’m really interested in pursuing the sauerkraut and all the fun ferments that go along with being a Fermentationist™.

Following a federal court ruling declaring the facilities not in conflict with federal law, Massachusetts General Hospital’s health center in Charlestown will be creating a mock safe injection site to help educate the public about the role they play in preventing overdose deaths and connecting drug users to referral services.

“We’re willing to demonstrate to the public that this is a safe, hygienic medical intervention,” said Dr. Mark Eisenberg, who is overseeing the three-day ‘mock up’ event, which will take place at the hospital, located at 73 High Street in Charlestown. The facility will be up and running, stocked with real equipment used at an actual site, on Wednesday.

Eisenberg said the mock drug consumption facility is part of an ongoing collaboration with the hospital and SIF MA now!, a coalition of medical, civil and law enforcements professionals who vouch for the facilities. The mock up comes just weeks after a federal judge found that the consumption sites do not violate a section of the Controlled Substances Act.

Specifically, the judge ruled that a nonprofit’s plans to open a safe injection site in Philadelphia does not violate the so-called "crack house statute,” which makes it a felony to “knowingly open, lease, rent, use or maintain any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing or using any controlled substance.”

The mock up also comes amidst heightened tensions among the state’s top prosecutors about legality and enforcement issues surrounding the facilities. In a letter to lawmakers dated Oct. 8, Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins expressed support for legislation that would establish safe injection sites, rebuking U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling’s stance that the facilities — despite the Philadelphia federal court ruling — violate federal law.

Eisenberg said Charlestown MGH’s health center has held safe consumption site mock up events in Worcester and Springfield, as well as at colleges such as Harvard Medical School and Northeastern University. He said individuals with substance use disorder who consume drugs under the supervision of medical professionals are more likely to enter treatment.

The most compelling piece of evidence in favor of the safe injection facilities, Eisenberg says, is the fact that no one’s ever overdosed and died while at one.

“We acknowledge that some people can’t stop using drugs, and if they’re going to use drugs we want to make it safe as possible,” Eisenberg said.

Selling a Home with Mold Growth Potential Problems

Selling a home with mold growth can lead to potential problems. This week alone, we have already had three calls from sellers with this very issue. Two were from callers selling a home with mold growth in their crawl space. And one was from a caller selling a home with mold growth in their basement. So, what do you do when you or your home inspector find mold? First, don’t panic. As a home seller, you are on a time line and can’t afford to mess around with mold. However, it’s not always as bad as it may seem. Bringing in an environmental consultant to test the mold is a great start.

Mold can grow anywhere, both indoors and outdoors. In Atlanta Metro and surrounding areas, we see a lot of mold in basements and crawlspaces. Mold growth is common in these areas due to the high humidity in Georgia. Another common cause of mold is from indoor water damage. Selling a home with mold growth can block or prolong the sale of your home. Mold scares many people, and most banks will not lend on a home with visible microbial growth.

How Can Mold Affect the Sale of Your Home

Selling a home with mold growth is not something you should initially try. Most buyers will run away at the first sight of mold or mention of mold. This is due to the many health concerns surrounding mold. Recently, one of the calls we received was from someone who had waterproofing to her crawl space. The company who performed the waterproofing treated the mold by spraying an antimicrobial on it and walking away. For the seller trying to sell her home, this visible mold that was left behind is a huge issue. The company told her that the mold spores are dead from the treatment. That many very well be the case; however, the buyers wanted a test for confirmation. This is where it gets tricky. A swab / tape lift test will only confirm that there is indeed mold. Now, this home seller must pay even more money to have the crawl space remediated properly. The goal is to eradicate all visible mold and the spores.

Mold can grow in any area of your property as long as there is moisture and warmth. Mold developing in poorly ventilated rooms or areas that had water damage, should be treated quickly.

Legal Problems for Sellers with Mold Growth

Just like lead and asbestos, mold can develop into serious complications. Therefore, you should state any information about mold to potential buyers. However, this is your chance to show them you had it remediated properly. Most remediation companies give a 2, 5, or 10-year transferrable warranty for their work. You can show this warranty and let them know it comes with the house. Buyers have every right to be cautious when buying such a large purchase. But you can ease their troubled mind if you have done your part properly. Selling a home with mold growth does not have to become a legal problem. You can even back up your mold free claims with the mold testing / air quality testing that Morris Environmental provides. It’s further documentation that an environmental consulting company has done testing to verify there are no mold issues.

Dangers of Mold

There are hundreds of thousands of different types of mold that have been identified so far. Some molds are toxic and some molds produce mycotoxins. It is these molds that cause the most health problems in humans and animals. Airborne mold, the mold you can’t see, is the most damaging to our health. While everyone will react differently to different types of mold, many of the symptoms are the same. Common symptoms include hay fever, asthma, skin rashes, lung problems, infections, neurological damage, cancer and rarely death. Those most vulnerable are young children, the elderly and those who have weak immune systems. See our mold guide for details on molds, the Mycotoxins they produce and what health complications they can cause.

What Home Sellers Can Do About Mold

Selling a home with mold growth does not have to be the end of the world. Face the problem head on by educating yourself. Get a mold inspection and test to find out exactly what you are dealing with. You don’t want buyers passing your home up because of mold. And, you don’t want buyers offering less money because of mold. Your mold inspector will be able to give you a protocol of what you need to do to remediate all the mold. This will help you sell your home faster and for your asking price.

Don’t be that stubborn seller who thinks mold isn’t dangerous and buyers will overlook it. Many molds produce Mycotoxins, which can cause serious health issues. Most buyers are already scared of mold and will not take the chance. Mold repairs are just like any other home repairs. Sometimes they can be costly, but not always.

On Saturday 31st May, 26 cyclists took part in the Five Ferries Challenge cycling 52 miles in one day to raise funds for OYT Scotland. Starting in Ardrossan, the cyclists took on the first leg of the challenge in record time, but due to the traffic, missed the Lochranza ferry to Clonaig. Undeterred, they had an extra long lunch break, then arrived in Clonaig to make the 10 mile cycle to Tarbert. Their next challenge was the 14 mile uphill climb to Colintraive, taking in the breath-taking views along the way. Finally arriving in Colintraive ahead of schedule (and avoiding the cows) they cycled the final 8 miles to Rothesay to be welcomed by the Isle of Bute Sailing Club and a BBQ. The final ferry journey to Wemyss Bay was a happy occasion.. Well done to everyone who completed the challenge, raising an amazing £5k- and still counting!. A special thanks to the volunteers and to George Leslie Ltd for the recovery van, CalMac for the ferry tickets and AG Barr for the water/soft drinks.

Q:

How to prove that if $\{v_1,v_2,..,v_n\}$ $n>1$ are solutions to $Ax=b$, $b \neq 0$ then $rank(A)=1$?

Given $A_{m \times n}$, $\{v_1,v_2,..,v_n\}$ is a basis in $\mathbb{R^n}$, $n>1$ and $b \in \mathbb{R^m}$, $b \neq 0$, prove that if $\{v_1,v_2,..,v_n\}$ are solutions to $Ax=b$,  then $rank(A)=1$?

Because $Ax=b$ has multiple solutions this means that $A$ is linearly dependent. That means that $m < n$. But it is given that $n>1$ so $m \le 1$. 
Because $b \neq 0$ then $m \neq 0$ otherwise we'd get no solutions to $Ax=b\quad$ (1). Thus:
$$m=1 \Rightarrow rank(A) \le min(m,n)\le m=1$$
If $rank(A)=0$ then $dim(\text{column space of A})=0$ but this cannot be because of (1) so $rank(A)=1$.
Is my proof exhaustive enough?

A:

The fact that the columns of $A$ are linearly dependent doesn't imply $m<n$: the columns of the zero $m\times n$ matrix are linearly dependent for every $m$ and $n$.
Moreover, from $m<n$ and $n>1$ you cannot deduce that $m\le 1$.
Your attempt falls apart, sorry.

Since $v_n$ is a solution of $Ax=b$, you know that every solution of the linear system is of the form $v_n+v$, where $Av=0$. Now $v_i-v_n$ belongs to the null space of $A$ (because $v_n+(v_i-v_n)$ is a solution of $Ax=b$), for $i=1,2,\dots,n-1$.
This means that the subspace spanned by $\{v_1-v_n,\dots,v_{n-1}-v_n\}$ is contained in the null space of $A$. What's its dimension?
Can you finish?

Penco began in the late 1800’s as Penn Metal Corporation of Pennsylvania making steel culvert pipe and over the years broadened its product line to include shelving, lockers, shop equipment, and rack. In the mid-fifties the name was shortened to Penco Products and the plant and offices were expanded to a modern facility built on 32 acres in Oaks, PA. During the 1990's, two additional plants were added for manufacturing capacity in Vicksburg, MS and Salt Lake City, UT. Recently, Penco acquired a 400,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Hamilton, NC, which now accommodates the manufacturing activities of Oaks, PA and Vicksburg, MS, while still allowing significant room for expansion.. Various institutions worldwide, from manufacturing to distribution, safely store their merchandise on Penco Products shelving, lockers, and shop equipment.

Laser-nucleated acoustic cavitation in focused ultrasound.
Acoustic cavitation can occur in therapeutic applications of high-amplitude focused ultrasound. Studying acoustic cavitation has been challenging, because the onset of nucleation is unpredictable. We hypothesized that acoustic cavitation can be forced to occur at a specific location using a laser to nucleate a microcavity in a pre-established ultrasound field. In this paper we describe a scientific instrument that is dedicated to this outcome, combining a focused ultrasound transducer with a pulsed laser. We present high-speed photographic observations of laser-induced cavitation and laser-nucleated acoustic cavitation, at frame rates of 0.5×10(6) frames per second, from laser pulses of energy above and below the optical breakdown threshold, respectively. Acoustic recordings demonstrated inertial cavitation can be controllably introduced to the ultrasound focus. This technique will contribute to the understanding of cavitation evolution in focused ultrasound including for potential therapeutic applications.

Combining recent developments in drama education, second language acquisition and English Language Teaching (ELT) methodology, this course offers an innovative approach to teaching drama as a key way of promoting learning and language acquisition in more creative and personalised ways. It is taught in conjunction with the Centre for Applied Linguistics, which has a particular expertise in ELT.

Balancing the study and practice of drama and ELT as both academic and practical subjects, it is suitable for experienced teachers interested in combining both disciplines (Drama and English Language Teaching) at Master’s level, or for teachers of English as a Foreign Language. You’ll examine how drama can motivate your students, improve their speaking confidence, and enable them to use language in cultural contexts, as well as improving your teacher-student relationships.

On Tuesday afternoon, a van plowed against a crowd in the popular tourist area of Las Ramblas in Barcelona, Spain. At least 13 people were killed, and more than 80 were injured, according to mainstream news media. The Catalonia Police Department reported that the incident was a terrorist attack, and so far, two suspects have been arrested.. In the midst of the commotion because of the attack, celebrities from Spain and the rest of the world took social media to express their condolences and share messages of love and support to the people of Barcelona. Penelope Cruz, Antonio Banderas, Jennifer Lopez, Melania Trump, and former president Barack Obama were just some of the A-listers who did it. These were their reactions.

Stylishly designed and updated by Nico Rensch, with the new interior in tune with the initial proportions and character of the building. The remains of the original leadlight windows were removed, but requested by the clients to be replaced by new designs, with reference to Art Nouveau characteristics, which would fuse the new interior treatment and the original feel of the building.. In the en suite master bathroom and dressing room, where leaded glass would be inappropriate, the design theme was continued with acid embossed tones on standard float glass.

Discussion. How many pounds of potatoes? Latkes for 75 people. - v. - vermontpurple Dec 2, 2009 11:09 AM.. Thanks!. I would make it in advance and place in large baking pans ready to heat up uncovered. This will help them retain their crispiness. Fresh is best, but I would not recommend doing that big an amount right before they come. I would guess about 30 potatoes (18 pounds or so). With 2 pans going and about 6 frying in each at one time, that would mean about 5 batches--1 1/2 hours or less.. 28 lbs, perhaps a little less if you use a lot of onion in your recipe. People tend to eat several latkes even in preference over other food offered. It's a "carb" thing, but also a "holiday" thing. It will probably take a little longer than three hours to make them, if you factor in the preparation time as they need to be grated and mixed. Don't forget to factor prep time in your time calculations.

Located in Hot Springs, South Dakota, the Mammoth Site is the site of 27000 year old sinkhole and hot springs. Mammoths (mostly Columbian, but a couple of Woolly Mammoths too) occasionally wandered into the sinkhole and became stuck in the mud and unable to escape. As a consequence many mammoth skeletons were preserved in the accumulating sediment layers in the sinkhole. A contractor discovered a mammoth bone during an excavation for a subdivision in 1974 and fortunately he and the city of Hot Springs had the foresight to recognize the potential for both science and tourism. Both have been realized in a greater way than either could have imagined.

Trending Artists & Designers at Collective 2. Artsy Editorial. Matthias Merkel Hess’s project is to make ceramic objects that relate to both contemporary art and the history of pottery. He calls himself an artist and a potter (claiming not to like the word “ceramicist” because it ends in “cyst”), though he also makes drawings, posters, and conceptual objects. He is most famous for creating ceramic casts of functional, everyday plastic containers, such as crates, jugs, and buckets; Hess confesses to having particular attraction to retro or vintage Rubbermaid products, which are staples in his studio for mixing glazes. Among his best-known works are brightly colored 40-gallon trashcans in the “Brutes” series (2010). Hess also uses his body as a tool for making works, particularly in a series of bowls fashioned from the imprint of his knee, as well as through use of his “One Merkel Ruler”, a straight-edge the length of his arm..

From its lexical meaning, “Honesty” can be defined as being fair and truthful, free from deceit, genuine and real, and devoid of manipulations or misleading statements or actions with the intent to deceive. Honesty is not just truth but truthfulness, which includes the intent of that truth. It is more than truth; it deals with motives and intents. Honesty is probably the greatest of all human values. It gives us great personal benefits and even greater community and national rewards. When you incorporate “Honesty” into your life, you will constantly remain honest in what you say, do, and feel. Always expose all of the facts. Be transparent, sincere, and frank with everyone. Don’t deliberately hide important facts, this means don’t cheat. Lastly, speak up when it is needed; become a promoter of honesty.

MTX is primarily used to treat arthritis till now. A recent discovery by the researchers from University of Sheffield in Britain may have an affordable cure for people suffering from the blood cancer myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The treatment is from a drug which has been primarily used to treat inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and psoriasis. Methotrexate (MTX), the drug in discussion, is one thousandth of the cost of a promising drug which has been shown to work in the same way. It (MTX) is also stated to have very few side effects.. Currently, MPN treatment, which is diagnosed in people in the 50’s and the 60’s, is limited to aspirin, removal of excess blood and mild chemotherapy. MPN is a result of an overproduction of blood cells creating a significant impact on quality-of-life, with symptoms such as night sweats, itching and tiredness.. As reported by IANS ,.

Induction effect of coadministration of soybean isoflavones and sodium nitrite on DNA damage in mouse stomach.
We have already found that nitrite-treated isoflavones exhibit genotoxic activities toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 and 98 strains (submitted: nitrite-treated genistein). However, we have not demonstrated genotoxic activity induced by simultaneous treatment with isoflavones and NaNO(2)in vivo. In the present study, we examined whether coadministration of isoflavones (such as daidzein and genistein) and NaNO(2) induces DNA damage in the stomach of ICR male mice. Mice were coadministered with isoflavones (1mg/kg body weight) and NaNO(2) (10mg/kg body weight), and dissected to collect tissues at 1, 3, and 6h after administration. We used comet assay combined with repair enzyme formamidopyrimidine-N-glycosylase (FPG) to detect FPG-sensitive sites. An HPLC-ECD system was employed to determine 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in the stomach. In addition, we observed leukocyte infiltration by histopathological investigation, and measured total superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the stomach. We confirmed that oxidative DNA damage in the stomach was significantly increased by coadministration. Total SOD activities were also significantly stimulated by coadministration. However, the induction of inflammation in the stomach was not found. These data suggest that coadministration of isoflavones and NaNO(2) can cause DNA damage in the stomach because of the formation of radicals.

Orthodontic treatment need in 10-year-old Dunedin schoolchildren.
The prevalence of unmet orthodontic treatment need was assessed in a random sample of 294 10-year-old Dunedin schoolchildren using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need. Approximately one-third of the children from this mainly mixed-dentition sample were assessed as having a need for orthodontic treatment. No children needed orthodontic treatment on the basis of the Aesthetic Component alone, but slightly more than a quarter did on the basis of the Dental Health Component alone. The Dental Health Component was reliable and easy to use, and it assigned approximately the same number of children to the "Need", "Borderline", and "No/little" orthodontic treatment need categories. As the Aesthetic Component alone failed to identify any children needing orthodontic treatment, it may be unsuitable for use as a screening tool for orthodontic treatment need in the mixed dentition.

Structure, genetic localization, and identification of the cardiac and skeletal muscle transcripts of the human integrin alpha7 gene (ITGA7).
We have determined the structure and the exon size pattern of the human integrin alpha7 subunit gene (ITGA7), which has been shown to be affected in a form of congenital myopathy. The gene is composed of at least 27 exons spanning a region of about 22.5 kb. The sequence of all exon/intron boundaries was determined and conforms to the GT/AG splicing consensus. We investigated the different splicing forms previously described in human and rodents. The major cytoplasmic variants alpha7A and alpha7B, which are developmentally regulated and tissue specific, were identified in human tissues, as well as the extracellular isoforms X1 and X2. The recently described D variant was detected in adult tissues by RT-PCR but not the C variant. We localized ITGA7 on chromosome 12q13 by high-resolution radiation hybrid mapping between D12S312 and D12S90 and identified a new CA-repeat microsatellite in intron 1.

All-optical transversal filter with tap doubling and negative coefficients based on polarization modulation.
A novel all-optical transversal filter with negative coefficients and tap doubling is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Based on polarization modulation using the anisotropy of the electro-optic coefficient of LiNbO(3) crystals, negative and positive coefficients are simultaneously generated. Tap doubling is also achieved by using wavelength- and polarization-dependent time delays in fiber. Due to the orthogonal polarity between the two coefficients of each wavelength, the proposed filter is free from coherent interference and the synthesis of filter taps is performed in the optical domain. The experimental results demonstrated that stable 6-tap bandpass filter characteristics can be obtained by using only three optical sources.

Bronchiolitis in Infants and Children.
Bronchiolitis is among the most common illnesses in infants and children, and is the most common cause for hospitalization in infants in the U.S. This illness can be caused by many viruses, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus. It is diagnosed clinically by history and physical exam findings, with a narrow role for ancillary testing. Management is supportive, with medications demonstrating limited utility in multiple studies. Preventive measures include hand hygiene, breastfeeding, avoiding tobacco smoke exposure, and isolation precautions for hospitalized patients. Palivizumab prophylaxis is recommended for infants with qualifying high risk conditions. Recent evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics to guide diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of bronchiolitis.

The effect of sinus membrane perforation and repair with Lambone on the outcome of maxillary sinus floor augmentation: a radiographic assessment.
The present study compared the regenerative outcome of sinus graft procedures in a group of patients who underwent the repair of an intraoperatively diagnosed sinus membrane perforation to that of a group of patients without sinus membrane perforations. A sinus floor augmentation procedure was performed in 73 sinuses in 63 patients. In 28% of these sinuses a significant (> 5 mm) membrane perforation was observed intraoperatively. In these cases, the perforation was sealed with a freeze-dried human lamellar bone sheet, and the grafting procedure was carried out as planned. The following parameters were measured on panoramic radiographs immediately postoperatively and at the 6- and 24-month follow-up examinations: (1) the distance between the occlusal edge of the implant and the preoperative sinus floor, (2) the distance between the occlusal edge of the implant and the postoperative sinus floor, and (3) the distance between the occlusal edge of the implant and the alveolar crest. The patients whose sinus membranes were perforated experienced no complications. No statistically significant differences were found between the 2 groups in the parameters measured. Lambone was used in all cases in the present study. In no case did the sinus augmentation procedure have to be abandoned. It can be concluded that membrane elevation must be carefully executed to avoid membrane perforation, but that if it occurs, it is still possible to continue the procedure safely after repair.

As the following pictures prove, Mila clearly knows what she's doing.. While the tutorial may seem tailored for the ladies, Mila doesn't want you to get it twisted. These tips are applicable to dudes too. Check out the video for the ever-endearing Mila's walkthrough on capturing photo magic, and don't forget about the most important step - always be mindful of any and all DMs.

The Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth has announced that she will be the first US senator to give birth while in office.



The 49-year-old Democrat, a veteran who lost her legs in the Iraq war, announced her pregnancy in a news release on Tuesday.

Duckworth gave birth to her first child, a daughter, in 2014. The senator will be one of only 10 lawmakers who have given birth while in Congress.

Duckworth said: “As tough as juggling the demands of motherhood and being a senator can be, I’m hardly alone or unique as a working parent.”

She added that her first daughter, Abigail, “has only made me more committed to doing my job and standing up for hardworking families everywhere”.

Earlier this month, New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced she was pregnant with her first child.

In 1990, Pakistan’s then prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, gave birth to a daughter, in what was said to be a first for an elected world leader.

I said to him that I believed in my endeavour to refine and simplify my building method that I had come as close to building the greenest or most sustainable board that I could. Not that that was my initial intention. Just something I have come to in continually evaluating the process and keeping it simple and uncomplicated by continually asking what am I trying to do with each step. I have also researched and tried many products along the way.It is now a very simple approach to building a board, with very few tools and very little waste.I have shared my process and ideas with people all over the world literally and have no problem with that although a lot of people ask why. My answer why not.. So it has been a very rewarding experience to share with Shaun what I know and build a board with him over the last few weeks..

An insertion deletion polymorphism in the signal peptide of the human apolipoprotein B gene.
In this communication we report the genetic properties of an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the signal peptide of the human apolipoprotein B (apo b) gene. There are two alleles of the apo B signal peptide; one codes for a peptide 27 amino acids in length and the other a peptide only 24 amino acids in length. Using the polymerase chain reaction the difference of nine nucleotides between the two alleles is readily detectable after electrophoresis of the amplification products. The relative frequencies of the Ins and Del alleles are 0.655 and 0.345, respectively. The apo B signal peptide genotypes are transmitted in a manner consistent with an autosomal codominant mode of inheritance with two alleles.

Clinical course and hemodynamic observations after supraannular mitral valve replacement in infants and children.
We report the clinical course and unique hemodynamic findings after placement of a supraannular mitral valve prosthesis. Children with symptomatic mitral valve disease whose annulus is too small for the smallest prosthesis are difficult to manage. One option is valve replacement with a prosthesis positioned entirely within the left atrium (LA). We reviewed 17 patients (median age 10 months) with symptomatic mitral valve disease who underwent placement of a supraannular valve prosthesis between 1980 and 1994. The actuarial survival rates were 88% at 1 month and 71%, 62% and 53% at 1, 2 and 10 years, respectively. Preoperative hemodynamic data (mean +/- SD)) compared with those after placement of the supraannular mitral prosthesis were as follows: "a" wave to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure gradient 17 +/- 5 versus 4 +/- 4 mm Hg (p = 0.003), mean LA pressure 25 +/- 6 versus 20 +/- 6 mm Hg (p = 0.07), "a" wave 30 +/- 6 versus 19 +/- 5 mm Hg (p = 0.006), "v" wave 28 +/- 5 versus 30 +/- 9 mm Hg (p = 0.31), mean pulmonary artery pressure 54 +/- 19 versus 42 +/- 15 mm Hg (p = 0.07) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 14 +/- 5 versus 16 +/- 4 mm Hg (p = 0.12). Supraannular mitral valve replacement provides relief of mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation. However, LA to left ventricular early diastolic gradients with large atrial "v" waves contribute to elevated mean LA pressures in the absence of prosthetic valve obstruction or regurgitation. As a result of this unexpected finding, associated left heart obstructive lesions and pulmonary and left ventricular end-diastolic hypertension, the outlook remains poor.

Milk River Flowform . . . On the road in the American Northwest.. Oil or Water?. Personally, I feel very strongly that, after 1600 K (about a thousand miles). of being constantly on the lookout for even the smallest source of potable. water, it might be wise to put the rising concerns about running. out of oil in their proper perspective. Do we wish to pursue the path. of endless resource wars, which Cheney, Bush, et al. suggest are a matter. of absolute necessity. Or shall we follow an alternative path, a via natura,. which to me seems so very much more reasonable. This would be a path which. conserves in the deepest sense. It is a path which sees water and watersheds. as sacred. And it is a path which protects and restores the great North American. tallgrass prairie and mountain forests so that the rushing waters will continue. to flow with conviviality and energy into our children's future.. What could be more important than this?

Graphene nanoFlakes with large spin.
We investigate, using benzenoid graph theory and first-principles calculations, the magnetic properties of arbitrarily shaped finite graphene fragments to which we refer as graphene nanoflakes (GNFs). We demonstrate that the spin of a GNF depends on its shape due to topological frustration of the pi-bonds. For example, a zigzag-edged triangular GNF has a nonzero net spin, resembling an artificial ferrimagnetic atom, with the spin value scaling with its linear size. In general, the principle of topological frustration can be used to introduce large net spin and interesting spin distributions in graphene. These results suggest an avenue to nanoscale spintronics through the sculpting of graphene fragments.

[Brain tumors in childhood].
Central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the most common solid neoplasms in childhood and the second most common malignancies after leukemia in the pediatric age group. Supratentorial tumors are more common in children younger than 2 years old and in adolescents, whereas in patients between 2 and 12 years of age brain tumors originating in the posterior fossa dominate. This implies a relationship between the type of tumor, its location and the age of the patient, which has to be considered in differential diagnoses. Medulloblastoma represents the most common malignant brain tumor in childhood. In the posterior fossa medulloblastomas are approximately as frequent as astrocytomas. Supratentorial astrocytomas are by far the main tumor type. In this report some typical CNS neoplasms in children are discussed and their neuroradiological features are demonstrated.

Noah Regnery, from Pizza Port San Clemente in Orange County, Calif., pours a glass of his Pseudo IPA beer at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver. Regnery won gold medals for two of his pale ales. India Pale Ale is among the most popular styles of craft beer, and the IPA categories are among the most hard-fought at beer contests.

The quest for top honors in American craft brewing has come here, to a hotel ballroom marked “restricted access.”

More than 140 bottles of American-style India Pale Ale sit stacked in donated Bud Light and King Cobra boxes, labors of hop love brewed by a cast of characters that includes an organic chemist, a man with a grim reaper tattoo and a guy who wants to make a beer that tastes like orange sherbet mixed with hot fudge ice cream.

During the next nine hours, beer identified only by number will get sniffed, scrutinized, swallowed and spit out by judges at the 29th annual Great American Beer Festival, the world’s largest beer competition.

Only one American-style IPA will win gold, making it the craft beer equivalent of winning “American Idol.” Since 2001, no other contest category has been as competitive. “Every brewer wants this one,” as one judge put it.

It would be enough to say that Ajiri tea, handpicked from small Kenyan farms, has a lovely, smooth quality that we adore. But there’s so much more: The company aims to employ Kenyan women (ajiri means “to employ” in Swahili); these women make the tea boxes by hand with dried bark from banana trees; each box has a removable label that can double as a greeting card; and the company’s profits support orphan education in Kenya.

Mount Pinatubo is the delightful result of a savage disaster. A deadly eruption of the 1990s left a humongous crater lake and dramatic lahar cliffs.. Jump inside an open-air four-wheel drive with your private guide and plough across the lahar landscape, thrashing over rocky terrain and volcanic ash. It’s an exhilarating adventure and you haven’t reached the foot of Mt Pinatubo yet.. Leaping over river crossings and clinging onto rocks, you finally reach the summit, and you’re flabbergasted by the colour of the crater water. It’s almost too blue to be true, so you take a leisurely dip. The cerulean lake contrasting against the colourless landscape feels otherworldly.

FITaos Mountain Camps. Please be patient as we wait and see what happens with the pandemic. We want nothing more than to have programs this summer but need to wait until we have the clearance from the Governor of the State of New Mexico to safely do so. We are currently reworking our summer schedule. We are canceling all overnights and out of town trips. Our sessions will be much smaller than usual (5 campers to one Lead Instructor) and will only be open to local community members per Governor’s orders. This means children who live and attend school in Taos can come to camp with us this summer. Space will be very limited and we are working on how to handle registration. Please stay tuned!.

2018 marked big changes for transit in St. Louis. The first new MetroLink station in more than 10 years opened in the Cortex Innovation District, the region’s bridges and highways underwent major construction, and dockless bikes and scooters landed on city streets.

More changes are on the way for 2019, especially for frequent public transit riders. By fall, bus routes and schedules will start changing as part of Metro’s plan to overhaul bus service on the Missouri side of the St. Louis region. The agency also plans to make public transit rides easier by improving technology and safety across the Metro system.

Metro executive director Jessica Mefford-Miller said that many of the changes coming in 2019 focus on creating a “rider-centric revolution” that will change the transit experience, such as adding WiFi on buses and other features riders have requested.

Here’s what to expect in 2019:

WiFi to expand across MetroBus and MetroLink

Metro started testing wireless internet service on 20 buses in December. That pilot program will continue into the new year, then expand to the full bus system in 2019. MetroLink trains will also begin testing WiFi service in the first quarter of 2019.

Fare gates and other updates to safety and security

Metro started a safety and security assessment in 2018, and the final report will be released in January. Mefford-Miller said the agency plans to start implementing recommendations from the study this year.

Fare gates were added in 2018 at three MetroLink stations, controlling access to the platforms by channeling customers through smaller entrance points that have fare inspectors and security guards. In 2019 Metro will improve the design of those stations and add fare gates to stations in the Central West End and Delmar Loop.

Metro is also seeking a new contract for security services, and plans to have selected a company by the end of spring.

Redesigning original MetroLink stations

Early in 2019 Metro will revamp five of the original MetroLink stations: Arch-Laclede’s Landing, Convention Center, 8th and Pine, Forest Park and the Delmar Loop.

Mefford-Miller said Metro hopes to transform the stations into “vibrant spaces” with new lighting and art to “better connect our stations to the vibrancy that’s happening in the community surrounding us.” Design will start in spring after Metro determines a contractor. Construction timeline will depend on funding. The five 25-year-old stations will also receive needed maintenance.

The Central West End MetroLink station platform, which is being extended, will also reopen in 2019.

Electric bus program gets rolling

Metro won almost $3 million for establishing electric bus service from two Federal Transit Administration grants. Mefford-Miller said Metro will receive several 40-foot buses at the end of 2019, with plans to put them into service in 2020. Eventually the program will convert 60-foot buses on the most-used route, 70 Grand, to electric.

Metro is also partnering with Ameren UE to convert the Brentwood MetroBus facility to provide power supply and equipment that will support electric buses.

The last chance to give feedback on proposed bus route changes

Throughout 2018 Metro gathered public comments on Metro Reimagined, its plan to increase bus frequency without changing its budget. The plan involves scaling back the number of stops and routes, but increasing bus frequency. Metro released a revision in October that responded to rider concerns. The agency will make additional revisions before finalizing its plans, so the last chance to comment on the proposal ends is Jan. 11. See the Metro Reimagined website for information on how to submit public comments.

Riders will begin seeing pilot programs and route changes in 2019, but the majority of changes will not take effect until towards the end of the year.

‘Microtransit’ tests

Metro Reimagined will replace some fixed-route services with more flexible options. One of those, called “microtransit,” shuttles people to specific employers or shifts. Metro plans to start testing microtransit in spring.

The shuttles will focus on areas that are dense with people and employers, such as Downtown, the Central Corridor, the Hazelwood industrial area and health care employment centers in St. Louis County.

Fresh technologies to make trips easier

Metro’s Gateway Card, which allows riders to store and pay fare electronically, is in a pilot stage. Throughout the year, Metro will convert more passes from magnetic stripe paper to Gateway Cards.

Metro is working with a company to develop new software to plan trips in early 2019, and riders will also have mobile payment options.

Question Description. Explanation & Answer. Thank you for the opportunity to help you with your question!. Let x be the number of gasoline and y be the number of gallons of kerosene loaded in the truck.. x+ y =5000. Equation 1.. Profit from x gallons of gasoline= $0.15x. Profit from y gallons of kerosene= $0.14y. So. 0.15x + 0.14y = 725. Equation 2. Multiplying equation 1 by 0.15 and substact eq. 2 from it we get. 0.15y - 0.14y = 5000x0.15 - 725. 0.01y = 25. y = 25/0.01. y = 2500. Therefore y= 2500 gallons kerosene. Substituting in eq 1, we get. x= 5000- 2500 = 2500 gallons gasoline.. Please let me know if you need any clarification. I'm always happy to answer your questions..

Population-based study of perioperative mortality after retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy for nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors.
To determine whether retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (RPLND) perioperative mortality (PM) rates reported from a center of excellence (Indiana University: 0% for primary and 0.8% for postchemotherapy RPLND) are applicable to institutions at large. We used the data from 882 assessable patients with nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumor treated with RPLND from 1988 to 1997 accessed from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. These data did not include data from Indiana University. The observed PM rates were stratified according to age and SEER stage. The median age at RPLND was 29 years. Of the 882 cases, 435 (49.3%) were performed for localized (Stage I), 380 (43.1%) for regional (Stage II), and 67 (7.6%) for metastatic (Stage III) SEER stage. Of the 882 patients, 7 patients died during the initial 90 days after RPLND, for a 0.8% PM rate. PM increased with increasing age: < or =29 years, 0.0%; 30-39 years, 1.3%; and > or =40 years, 2.7% (chi(2) trend test, P = .002). PM also increased with increasing stage: 0.0% for localized, 0.8% for regional, and 6.0% for metastatic disease (chi(2) trend test, P < .001). RPLND is associated with virtually no or low PM in patients with localized and regional disease. The PM rates for these 2 groups replicated those of Indiana University. In contrast, the PM rate of 6% for patients with distant metastases implies that RPLND for these higher risk patients should ideally be performed at centers of excellence, with the intent of reducing the PM rate.

Q:

Facebook Chat, Application, XMPP gives first test account during resource request

I have created two facebook test accounts for my test application. Both test accounts have xmpp_login extended permissions. I am using SleekXMPP python library to connect (with second account) to the chat.facebook.com server. At the Resource Request phase (iq type="set" id="somethinghere"  bind xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-bind"   iq) I will get JID of the first test account as a final JID as a response from the server, while I am trying to use the second account JID.
Is there some way to tell at iq stanza request phase to the chat server, that I am requesting some specific test account jid for my client (In the developers.facebook.com chat API example the options['uid'] is not used for anything) ? I would like to create few python clients with test accounts to my application which are communicating with actual browser users through chat.
Thanks a lot for help,
    -Mika

A:

Are you using the the X-FACEBOOK-PLATFORM authentication method? I.e., using:
self.credentials['api_key'] = '... API_KEY ...'
self.credentials['access_token'] = '... TOKEN ...' 

If so, Facebook provides the JID during binding based on the provided access token; there isn't a way to request a different one, and the initial JID provided when connecting is ignored. Are you certain that you're using different tokens for your accounts, and that it is the correct access token being used for your second account?
In the API documentation you mentioned, the options['uid'] is simply referring to the user's JID, in the form the_username@chat.facebook.com.
If you're just using the DIGEST-MD5 authentication option (i.e, not setting the credentials as above) then it's not clear where the issue is. Don't forget that you can join the sleek@conference.jabber.org room for help debugging with Sleek in that case.

Avoid poorly drained soils. Prune in winter if needed. Hollies are dioecious (separate male and female plants). ‘Rock Garden’ is a female clone that requires a male holly pollinator for fruit production.Rock Garden’ is a dwarf, spreading, hybrid evergreen holly that typically grows to only 12” tall by 22” wide over 15 years. This is a dense, diminutive shrub that features spiny-toothed, elliptical, glossy deep green leaves (to 1.5” long). Greenish-white flowers appear in May and are generally inconspicuous. Pollinated flowers give way to small red berries, which ripen in fall and persist throughout the winter. Even with good pollination, however, fruiting can be rather sparse for this cultivar. Birds are attracted to the fruit.. Foliage and fruit provide good color for the winter landscape. Also

It may seem counter-intuitive, but solar panel efficiency is affected negatively by temperature increases. Photovoltaic modules are tested at a temperature of 25 degrees C (STC) – about 77 degrees F., and depending on their installed location, heat can reduce output efficiency by 10-25%. As the temperature of the solar panel increases, its output current increases exponentially, while the voltage output is reduced linearly. In fact, the voltage reduction is so predictable, that it can be used to accurately measure temperature.

As a result, heat can severely reduce the solar panel’s production of power. In the built environment, there are a number of ways to deal with this phenomenon.

Different module designs and different semiconductor compounds all react to temperature – here’s a brief intro into what to expect.

Determining Your Efficiency

The best way to determine your panel’s tolerance to heat is by looking at the manufacturer’s data sheet. There, you’ll see a term called the “temperature coefficient (Pmax.)” This is the maximum power temperature coefficient. It tells you how much power the panel will lose when the temperature rises by 1°C above 25°C. @ STC (STC is the Standard Test Condition temperature where the module’s nameplate power is determined).

For example, the temperature coefficient of a Panasonic HIT 330W N-Type 96 solar panel is -.258% per 1 degree Celsius. So, for every degree above 25°C, the maximum power of the Panasonic solar panel falls by .258%, for every degree below, it increases by .258%. What this means no matter where you are, your panel may be affected by seasonal variations. However, the temperature coefficient also tells you that efficiency increases in temperatures lower than 25°C. So, in most climates, the efficiency will balance out over the long run.

For a geographic region where temperatures higher than 25 degrees C. are the norm, one can consider alternatives to Mono or Polycrystalline modules, which have the highest efficiency (At 1:1 concentration), but also the highest temperature coefficient at PMAX. Project designers may want to consider a thin film or CdTe module – or in the case of a very large project, High Concentration PV, which is designed for hot climates, but not applicable for small projects.

How to Reduce the Effects of Heat

After the module technology is selected for installation, there are several ways to minimize the negative effects of high temperatures:

• Install panels a few inches above the roof so convective air flow can cool the panels.

• Ensure that panels are constructed with light-colored materials, to reduce heat absorption.

• Move components like inverters and combiners into the shaded area behind the array.

Further information about temperature coefficients can be found in this research paper, produced by Sandia National Laboratories: "Temperature Coefficients for PV Modules and Arrays" David L. King, Jay A. Kratochvil, and William E. Boyson" (PDF)

Q:

What do i do when i have two o more meshes and i want to join them

I'm making a guitar, and i found that the easiest way was to make the body, the neck and other few details separatly. But i don't know much about how that affects the render and all that, i think that i have to join them, but the problem is.
If i ctrl+j and join them, would i need to join the two meshes by joining vertices or i can leave them like that and is all fine?. And example, here is the headstock of my guitar, i made the cylinders as an independent mesh and i find it difficult to join vertices.
How that would affect the end result?

A:

You don't have to join the objects if you don't want.
If you need them to move together you could just parent them. 
If you decide to join them, you don't necessarily have to connect the different meshes to have common vertices. 
Think of it this way: In real life those are different pieces made of different materials and they are assembled together. The tuning pegs are plastic or metal attached to the wood on the guitar head. In reality they share no vertices, edges or faces.



Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab said a new malware named Duqu 2.0 was used to target Iran nuclear talks venues

A leading cybersecurity firm claims several venues for international negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme have been targeted by a surveillance virus, reportedly linked to Israeli intelligence.

Kaspersky Lab ZAO said it discovered several of its own internal systems had been infected by highly sophisticated malicious malware earlier this year.

As the company researchers set off to investigate the cyber-attack, they found out that the same virus had been used to infiltrate a series of other targets in the West and the Middle East, including, most notably, hotels where the Iranian delegates met with the P5+1 group to discuss Tehran nuclear ambitions.

Kaspersky, a Moscow-based firm, said the "highly sophisticated" malware platform was a developed version of Duqu, which it described as "one of the most skilled, mysterious and powerful threat actors in the APT [advanced persistent threat] world".

It added that the level of complexity of Duqu 2.0 was so high that they believe its use could only be part of "a nation-state-sponsored campaign."

"The people behind Duqu are one of the most skilled and powerful APT groups and they did everything possible to try to stay under the radar," said Costin Raiu, Director of Kaspersky Lab's Global Research & Analysis Team.

"This highly sophisticated attack used up to three zero-day exploits, which is very impressive – the costs must have been very high."

The firm added that perpetrators were confident they could act with impunity as the high-quality of Duqu 2.0 would let their activity go unnoticed.

"To stay hidden, the malware resides only in kernel memory, so anti-malware solutions might have problems detecting it. It also doesn't directly connect to a command-and-control server to receive instructions. Instead, the attackers infect network gateways and firewalls by installing malicious drivers that proxy all traffic from the internal network to the attackers' command and control servers," explained Raiu.

Kaspersky didn't name Israel as a suspect but the previous version of Duqu was very similar to the infamous Stuxnet worm, believed to have been developed by the US and Israel.

Israel has long opposed the nuclear talks, as it considered a positive outcome could have greatly increased Tehran's threats to Israel's security. Disagreement on the issue also dragged Israel-US relations to a record low.

In March, Washington directly accused Israeli spies of having snooped on the talks to gather intelligence used to fuel opposition to the nuclear deal in the US congress.

Kaspersky's revelation that venues where the 'P5+1' group met their Iranian governments were targeted is likely to substantiate the claim.

The company didn't identify the hotels and said the attack on its own internal systems was primarily aimed at acquire information "on the company's newest technologies".

"Kaspersky Lab is confident that its clients and partners are safe and that there is no impact on the company's products, technologies and services," the firm said in a statement.

Duqu was a sophisticated piece of malware discovered in 2011 having been used in a number of intelligence-gathering attacks against a range of industrial targets. It had a number of similarities to the infamous Stuxnet worm, leading many to believe it was developed by the US and Israel.

Duqu 2.0 is an evolution of the original malware and is believed to have been created by the same group of attackers by Symantec, and is once again being used to hit very specific targets including the P5+1 nuclear talks and the events marking the 70th anniversary event of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.

The highly stealthy malware would have gone completely undetected while gathering a lot of highly sensitive information before uploading that data remotely to command-and-control servers.

I had to identify an unknown in the lab and it was a UV active acid with a melting point of 133C-135C. Sodium fusion test revealed no heteroatoms so the only compound that fits the criteria is cinnamic acid but although the IR matches that of cinnamic acid, the NMR doesn't. Also cinnamic acid is white, this stuff was orangy brown. I never took an actual NMR though, thats just the NMR they gave us to go with the compound so maybe they made a mistake. Any idea what compound this NMR is for? There are 2 singlets so already it can't be cinnamic acid can it?

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Gov. Ron DeSantis’ proposal to set a minimum $47,500 salary for public-school teachers received a boost Thursday when it was backed by the Florida School Boards Association and the Florida Association of District School Superintendents.

The two groups issued a news release that said DeSantis’ $602 million proposal “sends a clear message that Florida truly values the role and importance” of teachers.

“We applaud the governor for making education a top priority and see his teacher salary proposal as a step in the right direction towards attracting the best talent to the state of Florida,” Florida School Boards Association President Tim Weisheyer, a member of the Osceola County School Board, said in a prepared statement.

DeSantis has made a top priority of the minimum teacher salary as lawmakers prepare for the 2020 legislative session, which starts Jan. 14.

House and Senate leaders will consider the teacher-pay proposal as they draw up a budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, which starts July 1.

With Every Breath I Take, I’m Finally Starting To Love Myself

As I play rewind inside my mind, I can never remember a time in which I truly loved myself. My childhood’s thin, fragile skin barely protected me from the words they hurled at at me or their piercingly judgemental dagger eyes. The avalanche of stones bullies hurled at me buried me in negativity and self-doubt. By the time I blossomed into adulthood, the damage had been done, and I feared my soul was forever gone, my self-esteem permanently shattered. I’m not loving myself.

Yet, here I am, slowly rising from the dark rubble, like the sunrise from the east with each new day. As each rock rolls away, uncovering another small part of me, I find ways to embrace every piece of my being with unconditional love and forgiving kindness. Though it has taken incredible strength and unmatched patience, I am finally learning to accept all that I am.

With each breath I take and each move I make, this is me finally loving myself.

This is me finally loving myself enough to indulge.

I’m finally allowing myself the simple pleasures in life, like ice cream or sleeping in, without the overwhelming guilt that used to eat away at me. There’s no more denying myself all that I desire or punishing myself for partaking. Feeding the soul is a beautiful, human thing, and I’m no less deserving than any other.

As I love myself, I let go of the guilt and shame of my youth. I release the voices in my head that shout at me to restrict, to deny, to punish myself. I practice moderation; balancing my desires with my needs. I allow myself simple pleasures, while simultaneously staying aware of the needs of those around me. Cause no harm, but take no shit. Embrace your hopes and cravings while also showing your friends and family all the love in your heart.

This is me finally loving myself enough to celebrate and rejoice.

I’m finally allowing myself to smile and embrace all the goodness that rains upon me each day. There’s no need to deprive myself of happiness, nor is there any need to dwell on the past’s darkness. Celebrating my successes, big or small, is acceptable, and it doesn’t make me egotistical or any less lovely.

As I love myself, I let go of the cloud that has long hung over my head. I liberate myself from the belief that I only deserve to suffer. I begin to skip down my life’s path, celebrating each tiny victory along the way. I allow myself to smell the roses, to win the prizes, to climb upward. Don’t brag, but embrace the winning streaks as they come. See all the good that unfolds each and every day; the wonderful blessings that rain down from the sky.

This is me finally loving myself enough to see the beauty that radiates within me.

I’m finally allowing myself to look in the mirror and see someone who is worthy; someone who is pure. I will no longer insult my appearance or refuse compliments. Even my physical flaws are beautiful, and I’m no less stunning than any other woman in this world.

As I love myself, I finally step into the sun and see all of myself. I stand in front of the mirror, allowing my eyes to gaze upon myself without judgement for the first time in my life. I search for what my loved ones see each and every day, wanting to view my beauty with my own twinkling eyes. Look deep, but don’t search for flaws. Embrace the beautiful uniqueness that makes me who I am.

For the first time in my life, the sunshine radiates on my pale, soft skin. The storm inside fades away, and the path ahead radiates fondness and respect for all that I am, inside and out. I rise from the ashes of self-loathing into the dawn; dancing within the comfort of self-love.

This is me finally loving myself. This is me allowing myself to simply be.

I'm looking for a disc specific wheelset for my '06 Rockhopper Comp. I mostly ride XC but there are some great trails in the area with drops from 3-5 feet and I don't want to walk around the fun stuff because I am worried about my wheels. I need something that is going to hold up to those drops with 170 lbs + bike on it. Obviously lighter is better as long as it is strong enough. One wheelset I have been looking at is the FSA XC-300. I've noticed Kona has used that wheelset on some of their higher end bikes and the wheels have good reviews. Everyone says they are tough but I've never owned 24 spoke wheels and it does make me wonder about the durability. Also, could you comment on aluminium nipples; I know some people hate them. What are the major disadvantages? If anyone could recommend wheelsets that would be competative with, or better than, the FSA XC-300 given my goals it would be a great help. I have a absolute max budget of $400 but would prefer to keep it down near $300. Thanks everyone.

A few days after the race. on May 1 so I decided to take it easy, a nice 15 km ride out to the start,. a brisk (and windy) 70 km ride, some coffee and cake, and then the 15 km. back home.. I was actually going to do. a longer course, so the night before I'd eaten plenty of pasta in preparation.. I got up on the Sunday morning at 6ish and looked out the window. Rain.. Persisting it down. Ah well, methinks, better shift some of that pasta.. At least the rain let up a bit. Still a pretty wet 75 km mind. And the. other cyclists are few and far between. No streamlining today!. A nice ride out into the. northern section of the Odenwald in the company of half a dozen like-minded. souls. Not to mention the other 200 participants ...

Down-regulation of the expression of alcohol dehydrogenase 4 and CYP2E1 by the combination of α-endosulfan and dioxin in HepaRG human cells.
Pesticides and other persistent organic pollutants are considered as risk factors for liver diseases. We treated the human hepatic cell line HepaRG with both 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and the organochlorine pesticide, α-endosulfan, to evaluate their combined impact on the expression of hepatic genes involved in alcohol metabolism. We show that the combination of the two pollutants (25nM TCDD and 10μM α-endosulfan) led to marked decreases in the amounts of both the mRNA (up to 90%) and protein (up to 60%) of ADH4 and CYP2E1. Similar results were obtained following 24h or 8days of treatment with lower concentrations of these pollutants. Experiments with siRNA and AHR agonists and antagonist demonstrated that the genomic AHR/ARNT pathway is necessary for the dioxin effect. The PXR, CAR and estrogen receptor alpha transcription factors were not modulators of the effects of α-endosulfan, as assessed by siRNA transfection. In another human hepatic cell line, HepG2, TCDD decreased the expression of ADH4 and CYP2E1 mRNAs whereas α-endosulfan had no effect on these genes. Our results demonstrate that exposure to a mixture of pollutants may deregulate hepatic metabolism.

Sandy Goodspeed is willing to do lookups specifically for the Riverside Cemetery in Oneonta. If you contact Sandy keep your lookup limited to Riverside Cemetery, and please identify the name of the cemetery in the email.

Sandy Goodspeed I have transcribed and compiled the records of Bookhout Funeral Home in Oneonta ranging from 1917-2005.
The records start in 1917 as Kark Funeral Home in Bainbridge, Chenango Co.
The Kark Funeral Home ended business in Jan. 1919, and in May of 1919, the business opened in Oneonta under the direction of I Jay Bookhout on 13 Dietz St. They suffered two fires (most records were preserved); one in Dec. 1939 and at the beginning of 1942 at which time the business was moved to its present location at 277 Main St. In July 1947, it was sold to John Woodward but retains the Bookhout name up to the present time.
Copies of obituaries are attached to records starting in Jan. 1936 to present day. I only copied vital info from these. Until the last couple of years, records were handwritten and sometimes the writing was not always legible. Most all records listed cemetery burial.
Please include name(s) and dates as well as pertinent info you have such as parents, spouse or maiden name or anything that might help.
I have also transcribed the records and read the stones in Glenwood, Oneonta Plains and Riverside Cemeteries in Oneonta which would have information regarding any of these Bookhout burials.

1. Field of the Invention
The invention relates to speakers. In particular, the invention relates to a transducer unit, i.e. motor, having a diaphragm comprising a metallic section and a non-metallic section.
2. Description of the Related Art
A speaker, i.e. loudspeaker, is a transducer, converting electrical signals to mechanical energy. The mechanical energy displaces air to create sound. Since “speaker” may refer to a transducer units as well as one or more “speakers” in a full or partial enclosure, in this application “speaker motor” or “motor” refers to the transducer unit and “speaker” refers to one or more motors in an enclosure.
A speaker motor typically includes, among others, seven (7) basic components, a frame, a magnet assembly, a voice coil, a spider, a diaphragm, and a surround. The frame provides a means to secure the motor in a protective and/or acoustically advantageous enclosure. A magnet assembly is secured to the frame and forms a gap in which a voice coil is able to move.
A flexible damper, i.e. a spider, is secured into the frame above the magnet assembly and is glued to the voice coil to suspend the voice coil in the gap. The wide base of a conical diaphragm is flexibly suspended at a rim at the top of the frame and is rigidly secured to the voice coil.
A changing electrical signal is fed to the voice coil by an amplifier integral with another device or connected in series separate from another device. The changing electrical signal causes fluctuations in the magnetic field of the magnet assembly and the voice coil moves in the gap in relation to the fluctuations. The movement of the voice coil causes the diaphragm to move and displace air to create sound.
While all parts of the motor have an effect on sound quality, the composition of the diaphragm is particularly important. Typically, diaphragms are made of paper. A paper diaphragm excels at low frequency sounds, but distorts high frequency sounds due to the inherent flexibility of paper. Thus, paper diaphragms may be coated with a plasticizing agent.
In other instances, paper diaphragms are supported. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,071,828 to Glen appears to teach a paper diaphragm connected directly to the voice coil, but that is supported by a second cone in an apex region where high frequency sounds originate. This second cone is driven by the air in the air gap of the voice coil and helps the paper diaphragm achieve a high resonance.
This characteristic of paper diaphragms makes a motor sound better at certain frequency ranges while sacrificing performance in other ranges. Consequently, the speaker into which a paper diaphragm is built is limited to certain applications to woofers that produce low sounds and to midrange speakers that are suitable for everyday usage.
To produce high frequency sounds, tweeters, which may have a different structure, use a metal diaphragm. The inherent rigidity of aluminum, magnesium, or other lightweight metal or alloys permits metal diaphragms to excel at high frequency sounds. Using the motor structure described above with a metal diaphragm creates a motor that produces better high frequency sounds, but fails to produce adequate low frequency sounds.
Thus, a first need is for a motor that is suitably for a wide range of uses.
A motor with a metal diaphragm has a further draw back. Since metal diaphragms are heavier, the voice coil has more mass to move and, thus, either a stronger electrical signal must be provided to the voice coil or the magnetic field has to be improved. Similarly, to produce a more powerful motor, a stronger electrical signal must be provided to the voice coil or the magnetic field has to be improved.
A “super” magnet, also called a rare earth magnet, may be used to create a greater magnetic field that is capable of lifting a greater mass. Super magnets are typically made of neodymium iron boron, NdFeB. In comparison to ferrite magnets, these super magnets provide additional magnetic strength in a small volume, but lose their magnetism above 80 degrees Centigrade.
Thus, a second need is for a motor that dissipates heat so that a neodymium magnet may maintain its magnetic field.
To improve motors, voice coils may have the number of turns of wire coil increased. However, increasing the number of turns also increases heat proximal to the magnet assembly. Thus, a third need is for a motor that dissipates heat from a voice coil.
These and other needs are met by the present invention.

A Database would be very cool.A Database would be very cool.Just to give everyone who watches this thread a heads up - I'm finally making some big progress on a new project for TMO. It's a Tracks/Lap Times database. It will be a directory full of road courses (US tracks to start with) in which members will be able to submit lap times to, and have those lap times tied to their vehicle profiles. Each track will have lap times lists for each track layout configuration. It's going to be pretty slick. I just wanted to share, as I'm pretty excited about it and I think many of you are going to really enjoy it once it's launched.. But loosing all the history of this thread would be tragic.. 10-11 years ago, the Boss established a solid following for a very competitive track day/race car from Ford. The GT350 built on that foundation, yet still the modified OE Boss cars and 302S's are super competitive.. Lap times aren't just about vehicle profiles.

On May 25th, 2013 my boyfriend of a little over two years, Kevin, asked me to marry him! As promised, here’s our proposal story :D. Back in the day (when I was much more lithe) I did a little bit of modeling on the side. It’s been years since I’ve consistently gone on jobs but I still receive requests from photographers once in a while so when I received a request to work with J. Davis Photography, it wasn’t too out of the ordinary. I am taking an international trip here in a few days so the idea of making a little bit of money from a photo shoot sounded good and Kevin encouraged me to take the gig. I thought, “why not?” and accepted the offer. After a few weeks of grooming and (trying) to get back into shape, the day of the shoot arrived and I was pumped!

1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates generally to an ultra high-speed DDP-SRAM (Dual Dual-Port Static Random Access Memory) cache, and more particularly pertains to an ultra high-speed DDP-SRAM cache having a cache speed in approximately the GHz range. This is accomplished by (1) a specially designed dual-port SRAM whose size is slightly larger than that of a conventional single port SRAM, and (2) the use of a dual dual-port SRAM architecture which doubles its speed by interleaved read and write operations.
2. Discussion of the Prior Art
In general, SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) memory has a higher speed than DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory), however it""s size is much larger. A conventional SRAM cell consists of six-transistors, two nMOS transistors as transfer devices, two pull-up pMOS transistors, and two pull-down nMOS transistors. The complementary data bits which are stored in a SRAM cell are latched by a pair of back-to-back inverters. Therefore, these data do not needed to be refreshed.
On the other hand, data that is stored in a one transistor, one capacitor DRAM cell gets degraded over a period of time due to charge leakage. Therefore, for any high-speed operation, especially when the required memory density is low, SRAM memory is always the memory of choice.
As the speed of microprocessors has increased over time, the speed gap between microprocessors and SRAM cache memories has also widened. Many GHz processors have been announced recently, but the speed of the SRAM cache is still in the range of 400 MHz.
A four-T (transistor) single-port SRAM cell has been reported by NEC, titled xe2x80x9cA 2.9 um2 Embedded SRAM Cell with Co-Salicide Direct-Strap Technology for 0.18 um High Performance CMOS Logicxe2x80x9d, IEDM 97, p847, 1997. This single-port SRAM cell shares the transfer gates with the pull-up devices and therefore eliminates two devices per cell. This approach has significantly reduced the cell size, and surely is a very attractive design for a high-density integration. Since the pull-up and the transfer devices in NEC""s cell are pMOS devices, for the unselected wordlines, the wordline voltage and all the bitline voltages are held high. The nodes are isolated since the pMOS devices are turned off. However, the leakage charge from the internal high node is constantly replenished by the off-state current flowing through the pMOS pull-up devices. There are two drawbacks with this design, (1) the cell size is not minimal, since the is a minimal ground rule specified between p-well and n-well for placing mixed pMOS and nMOS devices in a cell. (2) read/write disturb on the non-selected cell is an issue, since their bitlines are not constantly held high when the array is active.
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an ultra high-speed DDP-SRAM (Dual Dual-Port Static Random Access Memory) cache.
A first object of the present invention is to boost SRAM cache speed by at least 2xc3x97. A second object of the subject invention is the design of a new dual-port SRAM cell, whose size is slightly larger (less than 25% larger) than the existing single-port SRAM cache.
A further object of the subject invention is to boost the cache speed to approximately the GHz range. This is accomplished by (1) a specially designed dual-port SRAM whose size is slightly larger than that of a conventional single port SRAM, and (2) the use of a dual dual-port SRAM architecture which doubles its speed by interleaved read and write operations.

Intrinsically disordered proteins and phenotypic switching: Implications in cancer.
It is now well established that intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that constitute a large part of the proteome across the three kingdoms, play critical roles in several biological processes including phenotypic switching. However, dysregulated expression of IDPs that engage in promiscuous interactions can lead to pathological states. In this chapter, using cancer as a paradigm, we discuss how IDP conformational dynamics and the resultant conformational noise can modulate phenotypic switching. Thus, contrary to the prevailing wisdom that phenotypic switching is highly deterministic (has a genetic underpinning) in cancer, emerging evidence suggests that non-genetic mechanisms, at least in part due to the conformational noise, may also be a confounding factor in phenotypic switching.

Paul Romano presents a new series of melancholic paintings for his solo show, “Boundless,” opening at Arch Enemy Arts in Philadelphia on May 1. The works in “Boundless” examine the turns that life can take and celebrate the beauty that can emerge from dark times. “‘Boundless’ does have a leaning in the melancholy, contemplating ideas of oneself through tribulation and loss and then, what remains,” writes Romano. “What is left is hopeful, the vastness of oneself, not defined by outside perceptions, or objects, or a place, or a relationship.” His highly symbolic paintings draw from personal experiences, fantasy, and mythology alike, emerging with narratives that celebrate the triumph of the human spirit..

I am so pleased to be able to offer my customers this special Canadian sapphire!. Master cutter Ralph Wobito of Stouffville, Ontario, working on a new stone cut, was inspired by gently falling snow and produced this unique design.. I continued to interpret the snowflake theme in my pendant design. A gold background follows the lines of the 10 mm sapphire with a finished measurement of about 15 mm from point to point. The addition of 6 white diamonds, 1.3mm (.06 ctw), imitate the sparkle of large fluffy snowflakes.. The stone has been set in 14K gold with a 14K chain which can be attached on either side (photo 1) or from a centre ring (photo 2).. No two sapphires are exactly the same. They all are a deep rich chocolate brown, marbled with subtle swirls of gold, charcoal and light browns, much like the granite Canadian shield they come from.. This necklace is ready to ship.

Attachments in prosthodontics are the means of stress equalizing for any rigid connector prosthesis. These attachments may be custom made or prefabricated. Prefabricated attachments are highly precise and need technical dexterity to achieve optimum results. Custom made attachments or the Semi-precision attachments are cast in the laboratory and specially made for each patient. This case report describes an inexpensive technique to rehabilitate an intermediate abutment case using acrylic and pen refills as their attachment.

[A case of nonresectable gastric cancer completely responding to combined chemotherapy according to the mode of progression].
The case was a 82-year-old man with advanced gastric Borrmann 3 cancer on the posterior wall of the cardia. Laparotomy revealed peritoneal dissemination (P3) and liver metastasis (H1). Because of his advanced age and on the basis of local findings, gastrectomy was not performed. In order to treat peritoneal dissemination with two-route chemotherapy, two tubes were placed beneath the cul-de-sac of Douglas and the left subphrenic cavity and at the same time, for the purpose of intra-arterial chemotherapy, one more tube was inserted into the proper hepatic artery. At day 12 and day 25 after the operation, 5-FU (500 mg)-Lipiodol (10 ml) emulsion was infused through the tube inserted into the proper hepatic artery. Within 24 hours following the infusion, hyperthermotherapy was carried out at 42 degrees C for 40 minutes. In addition, two-route chemotherapy with CDDP (100 mg)-STS was given at day 14 and day 28 after the operation. Furthermore, one course of FAM [5-FU (1,500 mg), ADM (30 mg) and MMC (10 mg)] therapy was initiated five weeks after the operation. Although no further chemotherapy was performed thereafter, both gastric endoscopy and CT scanning disclosed complete disappearance of the tumor one year after the operation. This result suggests that combined chemotherapy according to the part of progression is effective for advanced gastric cancer.

.. Called Pego, and judging by the illustration, the beast was terrifying with fangs in its beak and sharp quills down it’s back. But it would have weighed less than a house cat and was a herbivore – speculation is that the fangs were for fighting during mating competitions.. The fossil was surprisingly well preserved in volcano ash, allowing Dr. Sereno to study the bristles in addition to the bones. And the reason for this discovery is the Doctor finally pulled the fossil out of his desk drawer. It had been sitting there for 50 years collecting dust. Now, he is moving on to the second drawer.

The Iceberg is a high density housing project in Denmark inspired by the aesthetic of floating icebergs. The project and its unique design was put together by the collaborative efforts 4 international firms, CEBRA and JDS both based in Denmark, Amsterdam based SeARCH and the French Louis Paillard Architects.. Situated on the Aarhus harbour in Denmark, the multi-storey development covers 21 500 sqm with the highest point peaking at 8 stories. It was completed in 2013, over a construction period of about 5 years and at a build cost of € 32 600 000 ( N 7.2 billion). Its both a practical development as well as an iconic landmark for Denmark’s second largest city.. Here’s a description of the project culled from the Cebra website, (there’s also a video walkthrough from them at the end of this feature, so look forward to that).

Wednesday, August 18, 2010. Choices, Choices...Netflix or HuluPlus or Both?. Posted by Jeff Campbell in "Apple Software (iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad)" @ 09:30 AM. "The streaming content wars are heating up, and thus far it seems to come down to one of two worthy contenders: Venerable DVD-by-mail provider Netflix in one corner, slugging it out with ad-supported, studio-funded rival Hulu Plus, who earlier this month brought their popular service to iOS devices (and more) at long last.". I'm a big fan of Netflix, the DVD service as well as the streaming option, and now that I've received my HuluPlus invite I'll be trying this out as well. Each has different advantages, Netflix having the upper hand when it comes to movies, and HuluPlus for the TV shows. For a total of less than 20 bucks per month for both it's a pretty good package if you watch enough TV to make it worthwhile. I still wish I could get rid of my Dish service, and it is getting closer and closer all the time.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) will carry out a study into the safety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners because of fears the magnetic fields they create may have an adverse effect on health.. MRI scans are a common technique used by doctors to provide detailed images of the inside of the body.. However, they need large magnetic fields which have been suggested to increase the risk of diseases such as cancer.. HPA chairman Sir William Steward acknowledged that MRI is a useful diagnostic tool.. 'However, we need to bear in mind that the magnetic fields produced by the machines are quite substantial and that these fields are increasing in order to achieve improved clarity of image,' he claimed.. 'The exposures to patients and medical staff from the magnetic fields can be high and there is a shortage of information on possible adverse long-term health effects.'. An HPA spokesman told the Daily Telegraph that the studies are 'a suitable precaution' and that patients 'should not be concerned'.. © Adfero Ltd

In vivo transposon tagging in the nonheterocystous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya boryana.
Nitrogenase is an oxygen-vulnerable metalloenzyme that catalyzes nitrogen fixation. It largely remains unknown how nitrogenase coexists with oxygenic photosynthesis in nonheterocystous cyanobacteria, since there have been no appropriate model cyanobacteria so far. Here, we demonstrate in vivo transposon tagging in the nonheterocystous cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya boryana as a forward genetics approach. By conjugative transfer, a mini-Tn5-derived vector, pKUT-Tn5-Sm/Sp, was transferred from Escherichia coli to L. boryana cells. Of 1839 streptomycin-resistant colonies, we isolated three mutants showing aberrant diazotrophic growth. Genome resequencing identified the insertion sites of the transposon in the mutants. This in vivo transposon tagging mutagenesis of L. boryana provides a promising system to investigate molecular mechanisms to resolve the Oxygen Paradox between nitrogen fixation and oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria.

House Britten | Wellington. This Victorian style home in Wellington is positioned on a lovely large plot with beautiful old trees. The dwelling had unlocked potential and the clients envisioned the dark and cluttered house to be transformed to an open and inviting family home. The brief consisted of renovating the ground storey garage and store room to accommodate a new open plan kitchen, dining area, living area as well as a separate pantry and scullery. Furthermore the renovation consisted of accommodating a new guest suite and bathroom opening to the garden. An industrial feel is given to the interior with exposed I-beams, bagged brickwork and sealed concrete floors as well as a steel spiral staircase linking the ground storey and first storey levels. The existing kitchen and lounge are transformed into a third bedroom and the main bedroom is enlarged. All of the bathrooms received a new look with new fittings, modern tiles and fresh paint.<<

The NiceLucky Coffee Mug Warmer features a temperature control system which is a good feature to have. Basically, the heater senses when you put a mug on it and starts heating up. It starts cooling down as soon as you take the mug off of it, so you never need to worry about a power button or worry that you might have left it on. It reaches a maximum temperature of 55C which is hot enough to maintain the warmth in your cup but not enough to reheat it.. . This is one of the more compact mug warmers on this list making it a good choice for office desks. However, the hot plate is also not that large and might not be able to accommodate larger mugs. Check to see if your favorite mug can fit into the hot plate before purchasing this mug warmer.. If you’re looking for the best coffee cup warmer with auto shut off, this is our recommendation.. jpdfpspnod. March 17, 2021. Muchas gracias. ?Como puedo iniciar sesion?

Which is more valuable, longer survival or better quality of life? Israeli oncologists' and family physicians' attitudes toward the relative value of new cancer and congestive heart failure interventions.
We determined how Israeli oncologists and family physicians value life-prolongation versus quality-of-life (QOL)-enhancing outcomes attributable to cancer and congestive heart failure interventions. We presented physicians with two scenarios involving a hypothetical patient with metastatic cancer expected to survive 12 months with current treatment. In a life-prolongation scenario, we suggested that a new treatment increases survival at an incremental cost of $50,000 over the standard of care. Participants were asked what minimum improvement in median survival the new therapy would need to provide for them to recommend it over the standard of care. In the QOL-enhancing scenario, we asked the maximum willingness to pay for an intervention that leads to the same survival as the standard treatment, but increases patient's QOL from 50 to 75 (on a 0-100 scale). We replicated these scenarios by substituting a patient with congestive heart failure instead of metastatic cancer. We derived the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained threshold implied by each response. In the life-prolongation scenario, the cost-effectiveness thresholds implied by oncologists were $150,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY for cancer and CHF, respectively. Cost-effectiveness thresholds implied by family physicians were $50,000/QALY regardless of the disease type. Willingness to pay for the QOL-enhancing scenarios was $60,000/QALY and did not differ by physicians' specialty or disease. Our findings suggest that family physicians value life-prolonging and QOL-enhancing interventions roughly equally, while oncologists value interventions that extend survival more highly than those that improve only QOL. These findings may have important implications for coverage and reimbursement decisions of new technologies.

The California Department of Public Health provides thousands of free flu vaccines to local county health departments every year in an effort to limit the impact of the virus, which killed 300 people in the state in 2013.. But when NBC4's sister station in the Bay Area, KNTV, began looking into exactly how many of those vaccines make it out to the public, it found millions of dollars in waste with minimal oversight.. It's an inefficient system that has health experts raising this question: If counties can't effectively distribute routine flu vaccines, how prepared are they to respond to other disease outbreaks?.

Nope. You don't own digital games, they are rented to you and can be stolen from you for any reason. To me tracking digital games would be the same as tracking pirated games, they are very similar except a pirated game is worth more to you...Can you tell I hate digital games?. No, if the site had a way to seperate Digital Games from Physical games on the overall total then I would be more inclined, but I don't really think of Digital Games as part of my collection - The majority I have bought cheap when I have no option for a Physical alternative.I've noticed may people also add "Swag", Soundtracks, guides or even consoles, but I like my collection count on here to strictly focus on games.

Bacterial vaginosis increases in pessary users.
The purpose of this study was to examine the association between pessary use, smoking and changes in the vaginal flora. Patients using pessaries were age matched with non-pessary using controls. All candidates examined were women attending the Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, for genitourinary problems. Vaginal cultures were routinely performed on all women attending the unit, irrespective of symptoms. Forty-four pessary users were age matched with 176 controls (4 controls per case). The mean age was 60.1 +/- 12.6 years, and 15% of these were premenopausal. The duration of pessary use ranged from 0.5 to 8 years (mean 3.3 +/- 1.7). Weight, parity, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, UTI and postvoid residual urine volume were not significantly different between pessary users and controls. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was noted in 32% of pessary users, versus 10% of controls. The relative risk of developing BV in pessary users was 3.3 (OR, 4.37; 95% CI, 2.15-9.32), P = 0.0002. Smoking independently affected the vaginal flora, increasing the relative risk of developing BV to 2.9 (OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 2.05-8.25), P = 0.0013. It was concluded that pessary use is a very effective and conservative method for the treatment of genital prolapse. However, we found that the presence of a foreign body was associated with changes in the vaginal flora, thereby increasing the odds of developing bacterial vaginosis to 4.37; this was further compounded by smoking.

1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to an X-ray imaging apparatus that uses a multiple X-ray source, and in particular to an apparatus that provides an X-ray tomographic image.
2. Description of the Related Art
A multiple X-ray source that uses carbon nanotubes as cold cathodes is known. This publicly-known X-ray emission apparatus forms a two-dimensional X-ray source by using multiple X-ray tubes utilizing carbon nanotubes as cathodes that emit electrons and disposing X-ray radiation windows, for collecting the X-rays from the X-ray tube, in a two-dimensional arrangement. The X-rays emitted from the two-dimensional X-ray source of the X-ray emission apparatus pass through a subject and are irradiated upon an X-ray image detector. The X-ray image detector generates an image signal of the X-ray image based on the intensity of the irradiated X-rays. A collimater, in which capillaries are arranged two-dimensionally in a sieve-like form, is disposed between the two-dimensional X-ray source of the X-ray emission apparatus and the subject, so that the axial direction of the capillaries follows the same direction as the direction between the two-dimensional X-ray source and the subject (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-089445 (called “Patent Document 1” hereinafter)).
Meanwhile, a technique whereby a tomographic image of a subject is calculated based on transmitted X-ray images created using multiple X-ray sources is known. In this publicly-known technique, a radiation source that irradiates a target surface with an electron beam, causing the emission of X-rays, and forms the X-rays into beam form by passing them through a collimater hole, is used. Many collimater holes are provided on the surface. The X-rays that pass through the subject are sequentially detected by a radiation detector, while scanning the electron beam and sequentially switching the collimater hole. A transmitted image forming means obtains transmitted image information based on the detection signals from the radiation detector that hold subject image information for each pixel point. Because the X-rays enter into the radiation detector directly from the collimater holes, and almost no scattering rays enter, no scattering ray information is included in the transmitted image information; thus, three-dimensional image information that includes no scattering ray information can be obtained (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-060835 (hereinafter called “Patent Document 2”)).
The X-ray imaging system disclosed in Patent Document 2 is formed in a quadrangular cone shape, as viewed in the direction extending from the focal point to the detector. The detection target is therefore captured over a wide range in regions close to the detector, and over a narrow range in regions far from the detector. When this phenomenon is observed in the vicinity of the X-ray sources, projection data of the detection target cannot be acquired in the pitch interval between multiple X-ray sources. In other words, data missing regions arise in the pitch areas between X-ray sources. This problem becomes more marked the larger the enlargement rate of the imaging system is.
Another problem is the reciprocal relationship between scattering ray removal and X-ray usage efficiency. In conventional X-ray imaging, the cone angles of the quadrangular cone-shape formed by the X-ray beam are enlarged, increasing the X-ray usage efficiency, and a large subject region is captured at one time. However, when a large region is irradiated with X-rays at one time, the resolution of the image decreases due to scattering rays. Although a scattering ray suppression grid can be used to suppress such scattering rays, the scattering ray suppression grid is disadvantageous because it dampens valid straight rays as well. Patent Document 2 therefore reduces the cone angles, which reduces the scattering rays, but reducing the cone angles also causes a drop in the X-ray usage efficiency.

The same group of developers that recently bought the old Dixie Brewing warehouse on Tulane Avenue is hoping to demolish an old Pepsi-Cola plant on the same street. Mid-City Messenger reports that there’s resistance to the request.. The owner of the building is 2537 Tulane Properties, which is connected with the New York-based real estate development firm The Feil Company. A contractor with Feil made the demolition request for the building, which has been vacant since Hurricane Katrina, at the Neighborhood Conservation District Advisory Committee this week. Staff are advocating for the building to be preserved.. The contractor said the company does not know what they plan to do with the building yet, but they are interested in "apartment buildings, but also in hotels and in retail development." So, anything, really.. Ultimately, the NCDAC staff decided to defer the issue for two weeks to give the owner time to develop a more complete plan.

What you eat before and after you exercise makes a big difference in your performance and recovery, especially if you're an athlete. This training diet from the Iowa State University suggests carb-rich meals before, light snacks during, and fluid replacement after exercising.

The sports nutrition article states that it's not just the pre-exercise meal alone but the meals you eat in the 2 to 3 days before you exercise that fuel your muscles. So it's important to eat high-energy meals a couple of days before serious training or an event (track meet or basketball game, for example).

Although what you should eat would vary by the kind of exercise or activity you're doing—and how intensely—the cornerstone of an athlete's diet is carbohydrates. Avoid high fat and protein diets, since they won't provide energy for your exercise. Update: the article is targeted for athletes who are training for competition, so your mileage may vary. Although it recommends carbohydrates be your primary food source, if you look at the suggested meals in the article for afternoon and evening events, at least, proteins like eggs and chicken are included.

As to when you should eat specific foods, the general guidelines are to eat a solid meal 4 hours before exercising or a liquid meal 2-3 hours before. Within 1-2 hours before exercise, try a high carb/energy drink or fluid replacement drink. If you have less than an hour before activity, just have water or a fluid replacement drink.

During an event, go for water, and don't bother with energy drinks—they don't increase performance for exercises under 90 minutes.

After you exercise, get some carbs (from fruits, sports drinks, smoothies, juices, etc.) within 15 minutes to restore glycogen. Within 2 hours of exercise, go for a carbohydrate-rich meal combined with lean protein. This recommendation contrasts with one we've previously seen about low-carb meals providing health benefits post-workout by increasing insulin sensitivity, making it easier for the body to store sugar in muscles for fuel.

I have an executable I'm working on, and I'm using the active template library function AtlHresultFromLastError(). In the project settings i chose to link to atl.lib. However when i compile, it doesn't recognize the function. What do i need to do?. I noticed that MSDN discusses how atl.lib makes it easier to program with COM, does that mean that I need to port my existing program over to a COM application? Does this take a lot of work? (I'm using MFC/Console on top of all that)

Designed for a Filmmaker as a place of inspiration and work, the structure is essentially a cast-in-place concrete box, intended to be a strong and neutral canvas allowing the flexibility to adapt and develop the space as needed.

Utilising an industrial take on minimalist interior styling, the space features mid-century, sculptural furnishings, a feature-wall bookshelf, grand piano and a fireman’s pole from the loft to ground level for the ultimate easy access. The double height, floor to ceiling windows allows optimal natural light, and provides an uninterrupted view of the surrounding lush green landscape.

Incorporating a structurally self-sufficient loft, constructed of ½-inch steel plates folded and welded in an ‘origami’ fashion, the space is as much a tree house as a serious and creative workspace. Needless to say, I know where I’m headed the next time I need to get the creative juices flowing…

Another fried chicken fast food restaurant has arrived in Singapore, and this is one which came all the way from the UAE. ChicKing first established its name in the Middle East and India, and now plans to reach out to Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.

With big brother KFC and other established chicken eateries such as America’s Popeye Chicken & Biscuit, Korea’s BBQ Chicken and Singapore’s very own Arnold Fried Chicken’s having their respective fan bases, how does ChicKing fare?

With a tagline like “Real Recipe, Real Taste, Real Fried Chicken”, you would expect much. I ordered a Royal Snack ($6.50) which included a standard 2-piece chicken, mash potato, coleslaw and soft drink. Firstly, I was kind of disappointed with the size of the chicken – small, shrivelled and shrunken. I must say, however, the taste changed my initial impression!

Optimising the release rate of naproxen liqui-pellet: a new technology for emerging novel oral dosage form.
Liqui-pellet is a new dosage form stemming from pelletisation technology and concept from liquisolid technology. In spite of liqui-pellet overcoming a major hurdle in liquisolid technology through achieving excellent flow property with high liquid load factor, the formulation requires to be optimised in order to improve drug release rate. Liqui-pellets of naproxen containing Tween 80, Primojel, Avicel and Aerosil were extruded and spheronised. Flowability test confirmed that all liqui-pellet formulations have excellent-good flow property (Carr's index between 3.9-11.17%), including liqui-pellets with a high liquid load factor of 1.52, where 38% of the total mass is co-solvent. This shows a relatively high liquid load factor can be achieved in liqui-pellet without compromising the flowability, which is one of the key novelty of this work. It was found that the improved drug release rate was due to the remarkably improved disintegration of the supposedly non-disintegrating microcrystalline-based pellet; the optimised liqui-pellet seems to explode into fragments in the dissolution medium. At pH 1.2, the optimised formulation had ~ 10% more drug release than non-optimised formulation after 2 h, and at pH 7.4, the drug release of the optimised pellet was nearing 100% at ~ 15 min, whereas the none-optimised pellet only achieved ~ 79% drug release after 2 h. DSC and XRPD indicated an increase in the dissolution rate could be due to molecularly dispersion of naproxen in the pellets. Overall results showed that liqui-pellet exhibited an enhanced drug release and the capacity for high liquid load factor whilst maintaining excellent flowability, rendering it a potentially commercially feasible drug delivery system.

Q:

Difficult page make-up with centered elastic blocks

I have 3 blocks: one wrapper and 2 other inside the wrapper. Inside-blocks have same size. 
Wrapper is elastic and its width is being changed during window resizing. 2 blocks inside wrapper are elastic too. Each of these 2 inside blocks has min-width property. 
When wrapper is wide enough inside blocks are positioned in one line one after another. But when wrapper becomes too narrow blocks are positioned in 2 lines.  
The final aim you can see on the picture below:
alt text http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/9006/nessview.png
Important moment: as you can see on the third block, when blocks are positioned in 2 lines they are alined at center.
Question: is it possible to do this make-up using just html and css?

A:

Something like this works in IE 7 & FF 3 for me:

<div style="width: 50%; min-width: 300px; float: left; background: blue">Test</div>

Problem is it won't center align when shrunk, and IE 6 hates min-width. 
Still looking into center align...

Wide-angle lenses are commonly used in cameras amongst other image and video capture devices where a large viewing angle is required or preferred. There also exist so-called Ultra Wide-Angle (UWA) lenses, with Field of Views (FOV) of up to or even larger than 180°. A fisheye lens is an exemplary UWA that may cover up to 180° (2π steradians) of angular FOV. As such, having two fisheye lenses sitting back to back and facing opposite directions will in principle cover a 360° view of the surroundings.
Image capture systems equipped with UWA lenses have many useful applications. Examples are surveillance and security monitoring cameras, video-conferencing systems, specialty photographic cameras, and vehicle camera systems. On a negative side, these lenses exhibit significant amount of distortions that pose a number of challenges. For example, the output of a typical fisheye lens is normally a two-dimensional (2D) circular (oval for a general wide-angle lens) mapping of a 3D visually familiar Euclidian space where objects lie in real world. Inevitably, horizontal and vertical lines would look skewed and appear curvilinear, more noticeably for the objects farther away from the center of the lens. The relative sizes of objects closer to the lens look exaggeratingly larger, so that different parts of an object look out of proportion. These effects are generally known as the fisheye distortions that make it difficult to judge distances and object relationships. This is in contrast with standard camera lenses which maintain the scene perspective and linearity by capturing a planar view. Moreover, to achieve a larger angular FOV, manufactures may use a combination of several lenses. That may further introduce optical and geometric distortions.
Several techniques are known in the art to address the fisheye distortions. The curvilinear images produced by a fisheye lens can be remapped onto a conventional rectilinear display. In a series of prior art patents from OmniView and IPIX Corp. a portion of the full viewing sphere is selected and corrected for fisheye distortions. Although this approach provides a powerful tool for viewing up to 360°, only a selected portion is available at a time. The rest of the image is saved that could be available upon further selections.
U.S. Pat. No. 7,961,980B2 utilizes cylindrical projections in connection with circular fisheye mappings. As is well known, cylindrical projections stretch distances east-west. In particular, the stretching diverges to infinity at the poles. This solution would be useful for creating panoramic images when the polar areas can be chopped off, again meaning loss of information. Although it is possible to take different orientation cylinders to build several images, still this does not provide a single zero-content-loss (ZCL) image, that is, an image containing all content from the original UWA captured scene, with no loss of information. In fact, it is physically impossible to achieve full perspective correction for all portions of the image at the same time by applying any transformation.
Therefore, the main drawback of prior art is loss of image content and information pertaining to objects and their relative positioning. In certain applications, such as a security or monitoring camera, it would be desired to be able to select areas of interest and correct for distortions, and yet be able to preserve the full content of the image at all times. The present invention discloses an intermediate approach, whereby image data for all pixels of the entire UWA lens captured image is maintained to prevent any loss of information after the mapping that corrects for distortions to a certain level, as much as theoretically allowed. Furthermore, a locally adaptive transformation can be applied to the regions of interest that aims to partially restore the distortions caused by the UWA lens. Partial image restoration has the objective of giving a reasonable indication of the object and its relationships to the surroundings, not a strict full-image perspective correction. This solution will be particularly useful for video monitoring applications where a full view of the surveillance must be available for every image frame, yet it would be possible to transform objects of interest.

WARNING!

There is a possibility that you could brick your NAS with these instructions. Please make sure that you read the entire page carefully. There is also the possibility that you could unbrick your Kurobox with these instructions.

In general, you need to move into the include directory and do a ./configure and make install and then move into the jtag directory and do a ./configure, make, and make install as root. You will also need to copy the data/motorola/mpc8241 directory to /usr/local/share/jtag/.

You can start JTAG tools with the command "jtag".

Attach your JTAG cable and start your Kuro

The cable attaches to the component side of the board. That means you will need to remove the four screws that hold the board in place to attach the cable. Make sure you align pin one on the header with pin one on your cable (usually indicated by a red wire or mark).

Once the cable is attached, reattach the board, snake the cable out of your Kuro and close the case. You can also just leave the case open, but if you get shocked it is your own fault. Plug in your kuro and press the red button on the back and hold it in. Press and release the power button and then release the red button (no, this does not get you into EM mode). The power, disk full, and diag lights will blink all on and then all off indicating (no, not EM mode) that the watchdog timer has been deactivated.

JTAG tools command sequence to flash the bootloader

The following are the commands to prepare the Kuro for data transfer. This sequence assumes you are using one of the JTAG cables described here and it is attached to the primary parallel port.

Q:

Grounding Yourself When Working On Electronics

I was wanting to discuss if using a wrist strap connected to a in unpainted screw on a pc power supply (this screw is a mounting screw it is not touching anything inside the power supply) that is not connected or mounted to a computer as a grounding device to avoid static electricity damaging components.
Of course the power would be switched off but it would be connected to the outlet.
Would this be an effective grounding procedure?
Would this still cause static electricity to transfer since electrons transfer to what electronic you are working on since the power supply is not connected it it (like for instance a pc)?

A:

In addition to the other comments/replies, I'll add that an ESD wristband, by itself, doesn't provide much benefit if your goal is to prevent electrical overstress (EOS) due to electrostatic discharge (ESD). You also require a work surface made of engineered, static-dissipative material that is electrically bonded to the same ground as your ESD wristband. 

:: IMPORTANT ::
Your work surface should never be a conductive material (e.g., metal) nor an insulating material (e.g., plastic laminate); it should only be a properly grounded, static-dissipative material.
Imagine handling a circuit card that has static charge on it and laying that card onto a metallic surface.  The instant the card contacts the metal surface there will be a rapid transfer of charge (ESD) between the work piece and the work surface. This rapid transfer of charge (think short duration, high current) can easily cause electrical overstress that destroys sensitive electronic components on the card.
Now imagine using a work surface that's covered with material like plastic laminate that is acts as an electrical insulator.  You place an item (e.g., your smartphone) onto the surface, and static charge is transferred from the item onto the surface. If you now remove the item from the surface, you now have an island of static charge on that work surface. If you now deposit your circuit card onto (or even nearby) that statically-charged island, the electrostatic field can damage sensitive components on the card if the island's electric field strength is large enough.

So in addition to wearing an ESD wristband you also need to use a static dissipative work surface that is electrically bonded to the same ground as your ESD wristband, and you need ESD-safe hand tools.
Bottom line, you want to ensure

controlled (i.e., low current) transfer of electric charge between you, the work surface, and the work piece, and
that you, your hand tools, the work piece, and the work surface are all roughly the same electrostatic potential.

If you frequently work with exposed electronic components/circuits, there are some relatively inexpensive ESD mat kits you can buy.  Try an Internet search using the keywords "esd field service kit" or "esd mat kit" or similar.  Other useful Internet searches would be "managing esd" and "managing electrical overstress".
(NB: When working with electronic components/assemblies that are sensitive to EOS, never lay those items onto the outside surface of an anti-static bag or static shielding bag. The bag's interior surface/layer is engineered to have static-dissipative properties, but the bag's outer/exterior layer might not be static-dissipative. Furthermore, with static shielding bags, sharp wires on a circuit board can puncture the bag's outer plastic layer and make electrical contact with the bag's matallic-coated intermediate layer(s), thereby shorting together circuit board nodes that should not be shorted together.)

Recent evidence indicates that the prevalence of current cigarette smoking among adults in the US has dropped below 20%. While this drop is encouraging, smoking still represents the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US. Moreover, smoking prevalence is significantly higher among certain population groups, such as those with low levels of education and those living at, or below the poverty level. Therefore, efforts to target these underserved populations with efficacious smoking cessation treatments represents a vital public health effort. The overarching goal of this group-randomized trial is to design and evaluate a novel smoking cessation program targeted to uninsured and underinsured individuals. Key elements of the proposed study will be the use of an established network of community sites (e.g., community centers and churches) and a mobile unit, enabling us to reach individuals confronted with significant barriers to utilizing more traditional smoking cessation treatment approaches. Specific aims of the study will be to: 1) Compare the efficacy of three smoking cessation interventions targeting community based low income uninsured and underinsured individuals in a group-randomized trial. The interventions will include a Standard Care (SC) approach, consisting of brief advice to quit smoking, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and self-help written materials; an Enhanced Care (EC) approach, consisting of the standard care components plus a single health feedback and motivational interviewing counseling session and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; and an Intensive Care (IC) approach, consisting of all SC and EC components plus a series of 11 cell phone-delivered proactive counseling sessions and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; 2) Evaluate the role of quit motivation, nicotine withdrawal, risk perception, self- efficacy, social support, and negative affect as potential mediators of smoking abstinence; and 3) Compare the cost-effectiveness of the three treatment conditions. We believe that of the three conditions, the IC will most successfully address the needs of low-income smokers for several reasons. First, the IC program will be personalized, individualized, and equipped with an intensive, extended counseling and support module provided over the cell phone. Second, the program will combine three intervention components featuring high potential for maintaining support and motivation to quit and prevent relapse. Third, the IC intervention makes use of cell phone technology - an approach that has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy among low-income smokers in previous research conducted by the investigative team. The proposed study offers a number of features (proximity of services to the place of residence, provision of cell phones, etc.) that are likely to reduce treatment barriers while enhancing participant recruitment and retention.

RFID systems typically include RFID tags and RFID readers (the latter are also known as RFID reader/writers or RFID interrogators). RFID systems can be used in many ways for locating and identifying objects to which the tags are attached. RFID systems are particularly useful in product-related and service-related industries for tracking large numbers of objects being processed, inventoried, or handled. In such cases, an RFID tag is usually attached to an individual item, or to its package.
In principle, RFID techniques entail using an RFID reader to interrogate one or more RFID tags. The reader transmitting a Radio Frequency (“RF”) wave performs the interrogation. A tag that senses the interrogating RF wave responds by transmitting back another RF wave. The tag generates the transmitted back RF wave either originally, or by reflecting back a portion of the interrogating RF wave in a process known as backscatter. Backscatter may take place in a number of ways.
The reflected back RF wave may further encode data stored internally in the tag, such as a number. The response is demodulated and decoded by the reader, which thereby identifies, counts, or otherwise interacts with the associated item. The decoded data can denote a serial number, a price, a date, a destination, other attribute(s), any combination of attributes, and so on.
An RFID tag typically includes an antenna system, a power management section, a radio section, and frequently a logical section, a memory, or both. In earlier RFID tags, the power management section included a power storage device, such as a battery. RFID tags with a power storage device are known as active tags. Advances in semiconductor technology have miniaturized the electronics so much that an RFID tag can be powered solely by the RF signal it receives. Such RFID tags do not include a power storage device, and are called passive tags. Passive tags include at least one of rectifier circuits and charge pump circuits for harvesting usable power from the RF signal received via the antenna system. In operation, an alternating RF wave received by the antenna system is converted by the rectifier circuits and charge pump circuits into usable direct current (“DC”) voltage that can be used to power the operation of the passive RFID tag.
Harvesting sufficient power from the RF wave can be difficult since the voltage of the RF signal is in the range of approximately 200 millivolts, and a typical supply voltage for circuits of the RFID tag is one volt. Additionally, for relatively high-voltage operations in the RFID tag, such as for programming and erasing non-volatile memory in the RFID tag, a boosted voltage as high as 12 volts may be needed. Complicating matters is that the RF wave received by the RFID tag is not constantly provided, and can cease to be transmitted by the RFID reader without any notice. Thus, operation of passive RFID tags converting the low-level RF waveform to a usable voltage requires rectifiers and charge pump circuits that can generate usable voltage quickly and efficiently.

>>IMAGE.. I’m still writing them.. Why did I start writing historical thrillers?. The 20th century was short but catacysmic. It began in 1914 with the Great War, and ended in 1990 when the Berlin Wall came down. There’s a lot of great literature—shaped into stories— freighted with the weight of those times. I’m thinking of the work of John Le Carre, Alan Furst, Phillip Kerr. Their novels were catalysts that drove my own writing, tracing out the rendezvous with destiny of characters who lived through those decades—several of them based on real people I knew. My novels connect the dots of 20th century history, stitching its events to individual lives, mainly lived by smart woman who had to take risks to survive.. ![Alexander Rosenberg<br />.

[Effects of antibiotics plus efflux pump inhibitors on mutant selection window of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro].
To explore the effects of antibiotics plus efflux pump (EPI) inhibitors on mutant selection window of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro. In standard strains, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of meropenem, ceftazidime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin alone were measured. Then the MICs of four antibiotics respectively plus EPI, including reserpine, omeprazole, azithromycin, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl- hydrazone (CCCP) and Phe-Arg-β-naphtylamide (PAβN), were measured by checkerboard test. And the mutant prevention concentrations (MPC) of antibiotics alone and antibiotics plus different EPIs were also measured by agar dilution method. Selection indices (SI) were acquired through MPC divided by MIC. Similarly, the SI of meropenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin which respectively plus amikacin and amikacin plus ciprofloxacin were measured. In clinical strains, MIC, MPC and SI of antibiotics alone and four antibiotics plus CCCP were measured. In standard strains, the SI of meropenem, ceftazidime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin alone were >32, >32, 16 and 16. After adding EPI, the SI of four antibiotics were 16, 16, 16, 8 (reserpine), 16, 32, 16, 8 (omeprazole), 8, 16, 16, 8 (azithromycin), 8, 8, 16, 8 (CCCP) and 8, 16, 16, 8 (PAβN). The SI of meropenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin plus amikacin were 4, 4, 8. And the SI of amikacin plus ciprofloxacin was 4. In clinical strains, the SI of ciprofloxacin significantly decreased after adding CCCP. Both MIC and MPC of meropenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after adding EPI. The mutant selection window decreased when ciprofloxacin was combined with CCCP.

Q:

Can you use Azure CDN without having to upload the files to Azure storage?

I have a website where I would like to cache the few images/stylesheets/javascript-files I have. Is it possible to have Azure CDN point directly on the files on my server, and then cache them, instead of having to upload them to an Azure storage? 

A:

It's not possible. Azure will not allow you to configure arbitrary domain as origin domain to support origin content pull. The only available targets are existing azure website, cloudservice or storage account.



[Trabeculectomy combined with mitomycin C and removed suture in glaucoma].
To study the clinical effect of trabeculectomy combined with Mitomycin C and removed suture. Seventy-five patients (99 eyes) with glaucoma were randomized into two groups: a controlled group underwent normal trabeculectomy, an observed group with trabeculectomy. The intraocular pressure (IOP), the anterior chamber depth, the filtering blebs, the visual acuity and other ocular complications were measured and compared between the two groups. The incidence of postoperative low IOP, shallow anterior chamber, the visual acuity loss and other complications in the observed group were less than those in the controlled group. Trabeculectomy could effectively reduce the incidence of postoperative complication by controlling the amount of aqua oculi outflowing. It is worthy of application in glaucoma surgical operation.

gym. May 3, 2008, 01:09 PM. I was looking at this link, hxxp://, I removed the (tt, in Http), so the link isn't live, as per forum regs. It shows and explains how to do a 'fluff and buff', on a new pistol, prior to using it, or it can be done at any time if needed. I haven't done it on my keltec, PF-9 as it still is virgin in the box. Is this something that is more common than I assumed, having polished a few feed ramps and done some minor repairs, installing sights, and the like, in my day, should the average guy attempt to use 400-600 grain sandpaper on a pistol. I understand that this may be the equivelant of shooting a couple hundred rounds to "break in" a new weapon, Is it easy to feel how much is enough, my concern is overdoing it. And what pitfalls can those who have done this routine on their pistols suggest ahead of time. Thanks, the term made me laugh, I must admit.

“The technologists who built the Democratic Party’s data-driven approach to campaigning are saddened by the results of the 2014 midterms, a political drubbing that not even even the sharpest get-out-the-vote operation could prevent,” CNN reports.. “But they are taking heart in a durable truth: Even as Republicans made impressive strides in digital and data-driven campaigning in 2014, Democrats retain a culture of innovation and an army of campaign geeks that far outpaces their GOP foes.”. . But even the GOP’s top digital strategists continue look with envy at the technological ecosystem that Democrats and their allies have constructed over the course of a decade.”.

The present invention relates to an information processing apparatus for making an information processing in accordance with an input coordinate, a program that can be executed on a computer to perform the information processing in accordance with the input coordinate, and a coordinate input method of inputting the coordinate into the information processing apparatus to perform the information processing in accordance with the input coordinate.
Generally, in a personal computer having a touch panel, a tap operation on the touch panel is handled as the same operation as a left button click of a mouse. Therefore, the selection of an object, or the execution of a program can be simply effected only by tapping on the touch panel. However, conventionally, in the case where there is a desire to make the same processing as a right button click of mouse with an operation of the touch panel, it is required to change beforehand the settings such that the tap operation is handled as the right button click. Thereafter, in the case where there is a desire to make the same processing as the left button click of mouse, it is required again to change the settings such that the tap operation is handled as the left button click. In order to appropriately switch between a processing corresponding to the left button click of mouse and a processing corresponding to the right button click, using the tap operation, it is required to change the settings every time.
Thus, to switch between those processings without need of changing the settings, a touch panel system was proposed in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 2000-181630 in which if a position instruction for a second coordinate position is made while a first coordinate position is kept in touch on the touch panel, a processing equivalent to the right button click of mouse is effected. Herein, the position instruction means that the position is not only simply contacted but also the coordinate of that position is entered and detected. Accordingly, in a technique proposed in the above patent, it is a requirement for making the processing corresponding to the right button click that the input of the first coordinate position and the input of the second coordinate position are performed at the same time, and detected.
However, with this conventional technique, since the simultaneous input of the first and second coordinate positions is a requirement for making the processing corresponding to the right button click, the touch panel must be capable of accepting the input of two different points at the same time to input the coordinates to effect the processing corresponding to the right button click. Accordingly, a cheap pressure sensitive touch panel capable of inputting a single coordinate at the same time can not be employed, and an expensive touch panel of surface acoustic wave method capable of inputting a plurality of coordinates at the same time must be employed.

"We still have enough freedom to wake this country up and change the direction, but it has to come from the people. It won’t come top down. It has to come from the people because government reflects the values of the people, so if that’s what you want and you speak and you do your job, Washington will change.".

By Joshua Bowling | Arizona Republic. Peoria leaders struck a deal that lays out as much as $13 million in incentives for a developer months after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled the Phoenix suburb violated the state Constitution by giving out millions for another development.. The latest project, dubbed Stadium Point, aims to transform 17 acres of city-owned land from a parking lot into a bustling “live, work, play” corridor with office space, housing and retail shops in the P83 dining and entertainment district. The City Council in April unanimously approved a development agreement which says Seattle-based developer American Life will be “entitled” to a specific tax incentive, which has come under scrutiny in metro Phoenix, if it meets several benchmarks.. The state Supreme Court in February ruled that the city violated the state Constitution by giving a combined $2.6 million to Huntington University and its landlord in exchange for broad, indirect benefits to Peoria residents.

With popularity of home broadband and development of routers toward a 5G (fifth generation) technology, it is becoming more common for home users to perform networking by using a dual-band router or two routers. For example, there are the following usage scenarios:
A 5G band has small interference, and provides better surfing experience than a 2.4G network. A 2.4G/5G dual-band router usually supports both a 2.4G hotspot and a 5G hotspot. In this case, a problem that is prone to occur is described as follows. It is assumed that a name of a 2.4G router is AP (Access Point) 2.4G and a name of a 5G router is AP 5G. A user preferably uses a 5G signal. Coverage of a 5G network is small. After the user goes far, because the 5G network is still connected and a terminal can still detect the 5G network even though the 5G signal is very poor, the terminal cannot be handed over to a 2.4G network unless the user manually hands over to the 2.4G network. This causes very poor surfing experience of the user.

USA TODAY

EXETER, N.H. -- Donald Trump, retail politician.

The New York billionaire, seeking to regain political momentum after a second-place finish in Iowa, pursued an unusually crowded schedule Thursday in pursuit of a recovery win in next week's New Hampshire primary.

"You're going to play such a big role," Trump told Granite State residents packed into the well of Exeter's old-style town hall, also noting that he still leads many polls.

During the event, Trump avoided repeating his claim Wednesday that the Iowa winner, Ted Cruz, "stole" Monday's caucuses by misleading voters — a claim that continued to draw ridicule from some of his rivals.

“I don’t think it ever helps after you lose an election to ask for a do-over," Chris Christie told Fox News. "The fact is elections are played, they’re no beanbags, they’re not easy."

Christie, Trump, and other Republicans continued to criss-cross New Hampshire in a race with a number of cross-currents. They include the battle between Trump and Cruz, as well as attacks by Christie and Jeb Bush on Marco Rubio, who carried momentum from his strong showing in Iowa.

Trump, whose preference has been for rally speeches in big arenas, also planned some of the person-to-person campaigning that has marked the New Hampshire primary for more than a half-century. His schedule Thursday included a meeting with New Hampshire business owners in Exeter, and participation in a shift change in the Manchester Police Department. He also has another town hall Thursday night in Portsmouth.

The billionaire took questions at the town hall in Exeter, including one from a woman who protested his harsh comments about illegal immigration. Many migrants "do work no one else wants to do," the woman said, drawing boos from the pro-Trump crowd.

In a reference to Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, Trump said to the woman: "Who told you to be here, Bernie?"

In attacking Cruz for his tactics in Iowa, Trump noted that Cruz operatives spread false rumors that Ben Carson was pulling out of the race, and urged his supporters to back the Texan. The Trump campaign has also hit a Cruz mailer that gave voters false information about qualifying to caucus.

Cruz said he has apologized to Carson, but mocked Trump's complaints about sour grapes. "I don’t think the people are interested in temper tantrums," Cruz said of the billionaire on Thursday.

Rubio, hoping to build on his third-place finish in Iowa, also stumped the Granite State in the face of heavy criticism from rivals.

Bush, the former Florida governor who backed Rubio's political rise in that state, told NBC News that his former protege is "a gifted politician," but his life is built "around his own ambitions." Bush also had his own special event planned for Thursday night, featuring mother and former first lady Barbara Bush.

Christie, appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe, continued to argue that Rubio has done nothing in the U.S. Senate, and to describe Rubio as a "bubble boy" who avoids answering tough questions. The New Jersey governor noted that a new Rubio endorser — former presidential candidate Rick Santorum — couldn't name a Rubio accomplishment.

"So it's time for the boy in the bubble to come out of the bubble and answer these questions and tell us things rather than just continue to give the same speech he's been giving for the last six years," the New Jersey governor said.

Rubio, campaigning on the theme that he represents a new generation of leadership, said opponents are attacking him because he is doing well.

“It’s sad that after finishing near the bottom in Iowa, Jeb Bush and Chris Christie are now doing everything possible to tear down Marco Rubio, the one conservative who can beat Hillary Clinton" said Rubio spokesman Jahan Wilcox.

Many of these claims will be aired Saturday night, when Republican candidates gather for their last debate before Tuesday's primary.

Antidumping Reformers Rejoice

Antidumping policy moves incrementally in the right direction only on rare occasions. In that regard, last week was nothing short of historic. In addition to the U.S. International Trade Commission deviating from its conventional script and revoking 15 longstanding antidumping measures on key steel products (described here), the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced to Congress the administration’s decision to implement a critical change to the Commerce Department’s antidumping calculation methodology, which, if implemented in good faith, will likely reduce the incidence and disruptive impact of antidumping measures henceforth.

In response to a series of rulings from the dispute settlement body of the World Trade Organization, which found a U.S. methodological practice known as “zeroing” to violate Article 2.4.2 of the WTO’s Antidumping Agreement, Commerce decided (albeit, grudgingly) to change it’s policy. I have described zeroing and its impact in a few previous papers and in this blog post, but here’s a brief summary.

In a typical antidumping investigation, the sales and cost data of each foreign company under investigation are subject to a series of calculations before the bottom line “dumping margin” is produced. Usually, the Commerce Department calculates average net prices for each product (i.e., widget model 1, widget model 2, etc.) sold in the U.S. and home markets. The average U.S. and average home market prices of widget model 1 are compared, the average prices of widget model 2 are compared, and so on. In some cases there may be few comparisons, and in others there may be hundred or even thousands of comparisons. Some of those comparisons may generate positive dumping margins (when average home market price exceeds average U.S. price) and some may generate negative dumping margins (when U.S. price is higher).

Commerce then calculates from all of these model-specific comparisons an overall weighted-average dumping margin. But before calculating the overall average, Commerce tinkers with the mathematics by zeroing. Zeroing refers to the practice of assigning a value of zero to all of the comparisons that generate a negative dumping margin. Only after zeroing does Commerce calculate the average dumping margin. So, in other words, zeroing precludes the negatively dumped sales from having the proper impact on the “average” dumping margin. Thus, if 99 of 100 comparisons generate large negative dumping margins and 1 of 100 produces a positive dumping margin, zeroing ensures that the average dumping margin calculated is positive. Pretty fair, huh?

In research that Brink Lindsey and I conducted a few years ago, we found that zeroing is highly distorting. In a sample of 18 actual antidumping determinations, we found that calculated dumping margins would have been on average 86% lower had zeroing not been employed. Five of those 18 cases would have resulted in the cases being dropped, and antidumping measures never having been imposed. So the change in policy is laudable and potentially very significant.

I say “potentially” because zeroing reform remains incomplete. The policy change announced last week pertains to zeroing in what are called average-to-average comparisons. In some cases, the Commerce Department compares average prices to transaction-specific prices and in others it compares transaction-specific to transaction-specific prices. It is possible that Commerce will use these methodologies more frequently now and continue to zero (at least until zeroing under these comparison methodologies is found in violation of our WTO commitments as well).

And there is one other possible obstacle on the road to implementing this change: Congress. Although zeroing is not mandated by law, the practice has been in use for a very long time. Cases have been heard in the Court of International Trade and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concerning the question of whether zeroing is even permitted under the statute. Both courts have ruled that zeroing is a permissible interpretation of the statue, which has been taken by some in Congress to mean, wrongly, that zeroing is a requirement of the statute.

Congress, which is bipartisan in its broad support of a strong (i.e., menacing and unfair) antidumping law, may seek a fight with the administration over the propriety of changing the zeroing practice without input from the legislative branch. But, by and large, last week’s zeroing announcement was another rare victory for antidumping reform.

Tantalum pentoxide

Tantalum pentoxide, also known as tantalum(V) oxide, is the inorganic compound with the formula . It is a white solid that is insoluble in all solvents but is attacked by strong bases and hydrofluoric acid.  is an inert material with a high refractive index and low absorption (i.e. colourless), which makes it useful for coatings. It is also extensively used in the production of capacitors, due to its high dielectric constant.

Preparation

Occurrence
Tantalum occurs in the minerals tantalite and columbite (columbium being an archaic name for niobium), which occur in pegmatites, an igneous rock formation. Mixtures of columbite and tantalite are called coltan.  Tantalite was discovered by Anders Gustaf Ekeberg at Ytterby, Sweden, and Kimoto, Finland. The minerals microlite and pyrochlore contain approximately 70% and 10% Ta, respectively.

Refining
Tantalum ores often contain significant amounts of niobium, which is itself a valuable metal. As such, both metals are extracted so that they may be sold. The overall process is one of hydrometallurgy and begins with a leaching step; in which the ore is treated with hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble hydrogen fluorides, such as the heptafluorotantalate. This allows the metals to be separated from the various non-metallic impurities in the rock.

(FeMn)(NbTa)2O6 + 16 HF → H2[TaF7] + H2[NbOF5] + FeF2 + MnF2 + 6 H2O

The tantalum and niobium hydrogenflorides are then removed from the aqueous solution by liquid-liquid extraction using organic solvents, such as cyclohexanone or methyl isobutyl ketone. This step allows the simple removal of various metal impurities (e.g. iron and manganese) which remain in the aqueous phase in the form of fluorides. Separation of the tantalum and niobium is then achieved by pH adjustment. Niobium requires a higher level of acidity to remain soluble in the organic phase and can hence be selectively removed by extraction into less acidic water.
The pure tantalum hydrogen fluoride solution is then neutralised with aqueous ammonia to give hydrated tantalum oxide (Ta2O5(H2O)x), which is calcinated to tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) as described in these idealized equations:

 H2[TaF7] + 5 H2O + 7 NH3 →  Ta2O5(H2O)5 + 7 NH4F
 Ta2O5(H2O)5  →   Ta2O5 + 5 H2O

Natural pure tantalum oxide is known as the mineral tantite, although it is exceedingly rare.

From alkoxides
Tantalum oxide is frequently used in electronics, often in the form of thin films. For these applications it can be produced by MOCVD (or related techniques), which involves the hydrolysis of its volatile halides or alkoxides:

 Ta2(OEt)10 + 5 H2O → Ta2O5 + 10 EtOH
 2 TaCl5 + 5 H2O → Ta2O5 + 10 HCl

Structure and properties 
The crystal structure of tantalum pentoxide has been the matter of some debate. The bulk material is disordered, being either amorphous or polycrystalline; with single crystals being difficult to grow. As such Xray crystallography has largely been limited to powder diffraction, which provides less structural information.

At least 2 polymorphs are known to exist. A low temperature form, known as L- or β-Ta2O5, and the high temperature form known as H- or α-Ta2O5. The transition between these two forms is slow and reversible; taking place between 1000 and 1360 °C, with a mixture of structures existing at intermediate temperatures. The structures of both polymorphs consist of chains built from octahedral TaO6 and pentagonal bipyramidal TaO7 polyhedra sharing opposite vertices; which are further joined by edge-sharing. The overall crystal system is orthorhombic in both cases, with the space group of β-Ta2O5 being identified as Pna2 by single crystal X-ray diffraction.
A high pressure form (Z-Ta2O5) has also been reported, in which the Ta atoms adopt a 7 coordinate geometry to give a monoclinic structure (space group C2).

Purely amorphous tantalum pentoxide has a similar local structure to the crystalline polymorphs, built from TaO6 and TaO7 polyhedra, while the molten liquid phase has a distinct structure based on lower coordination polyhedra, mainly TaO5 and TaO6.

The difficulty in forming material with a uniform structure has led to variations in its reported properties. Like many metal oxides Ta2O5 is an insulator and its band gap has variously been reported as being between 3.8 and 5.3 eV, depending on the method of manufacture. In general the more amorphous the material the greater its observed band gap.
These observed values are significantly higher than those predicted by computational chemistry (2.3 - 3.8 eV).

Its dielectric constant is typically about 25 although values of over 50 have been reported. In general tantalum pentoxide is considered to be a high-k dielectric material.

Reactions 
Ta2O5 does not react appreciably with either HCl or HBr, however it will dissolve in hydrofluoric acid, and reacts with potassium bifluoride and HF according to the following equation:

Ta2O5  +  4 KHF2 + 6 HF   →   2 K2[TaF7]  +  5 H2O

Ta2O5 can be reduced to metallic Ta via the use of metallic reductants such as calcium and aluminium.

Ta2O5 + 5 Ca →  2 Ta + 5 CaO

Uses

In electronics 
Owing to its high band gap and dielectric constant, tantalum pentoxide has found a variety of uses in electronics, particularly in tantalum capacitors. These are used in automotive electronics, cell phones, and pagers, electronic circuitry; thin-film components; and high-speed tools. In the 1990s, interest grew in the use of tantalum oxide as a high-k dielectric for DRAM capacitor applications.,

It is used in on-chip metal-insulator-metal capacitors for high frequency CMOS integrated circuits. Tantalum oxide may have applications as the charge trapping layer for Non-volatile memories., There are applications  of tantalum oxide in resistive switching memories.

Other uses 
Due to its high refractive index, Ta2O5 has been utilized in the fabrication of the glass of photographic lenses.

A trial with a new peripheral implanted vascular access device.
In a prospective study, a new implanted vascular access device designed for peripheral placement in the arm was evaluated. Thirty-two patients requiring long-term venous access received the Port-A-Cath P.A.S. Port over a 13-month period. The access devices were used for multiple therapies including chemotherapy, antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and blood products. After 4,896 patient days (range 12-388), 19 complications occurred in 14 patients or 3.88/1,000 catheter days. The infection rate was 3% or 0.2/1,000 catheter days. Port pocket cellulitis was reported in 3% of patients or 0.2/1,000 catheter days. Vein phlebitis occurred at 12.5% or 0.8/1,000 catheter days. Two instances of vessel thrombosis occurred (6.2% or 0.4/1,000 catheter days). Ten incidents in six patients of inability to aspirate blood samples were noted (18.75% or 2/1,000 catheter days). No infiltrations or extravasations were reported. Nurses involved in this early trial found performance similar to the standard venous chest ports. Peripheral port placement was accepted well by patients.

Electronic control of pathologic tone disturbances in the larynx.
The complex anatomy of the larynx and the wide varieties of disturbances potentially affecting the tension of its constituent muscles give rise to various clinical presentations. Whatever the causes of pathologic tone disturbances affecting the larynx, rehabilitation should start by focusing on the dynamic adjustment of glottic tension in the muscles that have become separated from their respective central nervous system command centers. The objective of laryngeal rehabilitation is combined restoration of individual behaviors such that mutual, global relationships simulating those present before disability are reestablished.

Pebbles in the pond

What the World Needs Now

The answer is always the same — “Love, sweet love.” Hal David’s lyrics to the Burt Bachrach score. Reverberating in John Lennon’s “All You Need Is Love” a couple years later.

Yet at almost all times in memory there have been huge groups of people so angry at each other that the differences indeed appear irreconcilable. If they are truly irreconcilable differences, God help our great grandchildren, as Weapons of Mass Destruction (biological and chemical as well as radiological) become more and more refined and more and more available to anyone.

Shiites and Sunnis are once more at each other’s throats in Iraq — all we did was postpone it with the gallant soldiers who threw themselves bravely into the turmoil. Kurds are taking advantage of the distraction by consolidating their terrain. In our own country, there’s Fox News and the Outraged Democrats. Anywhere in the world you look somebody hates somebody, righteously holding onto their grudges and refusing to forgive. Even True Christians who know the sacredness of Forgiveness are allowing themselves this exception to the rule — they are allowed to hate at least one bad guy like “the Devil” and in real life other folks too with whom one has a long-running melodrama. And in the current Acceleritis™-degraded environment, each of us flips into demonizing another person or group at least briefly. This tendency has become so ingrained — maybe it’s just somebody driving too slowly in front of you when you can’t pass. Old brain circuits don’t die easily.

While we can all agree that this is pretty much the real scenario, most of us seem to feel nothing can be done about it. It’s the way the world is, and the world especially today has become so complex and so full of powerful rich people that control everything, what can any of us regular folks do to change anything so big and so pervasive?

We not only can do plenty, we are already doing it. As far as I can tell so far, it was not a huge conspiracy theory that brought about digital media, aimed at the democratization of power. It “just happened”. Possibly the plot was written from on high. In any case the inmates are now running the asylum to a more massive degree than ever before. Why not channel at least a tiny fraction of this digital free-for-all into content that evokes our capacity to love and forgive?

Sounds like boring screen fare? Not necessarily. Picture the MTV series “True Life” and then imagine amateur videographers all over the world starting to generate YouTube ongoing cinema verité series about friendships between a Sunni and a Shiite in Iraq, a Brit and a Catholic Irishman in Northern Ireland, a Liberal and a Conservative in the U.S., and other pairings of individuals from groups assumed to always hate each other. Maybe in some cases the friendships are between musicians or entertainers, perhaps from diverse cultures and global locations. Such as Yo-Yo Ma’s Silk Road Ensemble and other projects.

It might not be spectacular or grotesque enough to go viral, but as a constant drip-drip-drip in areas of the world where the hatred seethes to the boiling point today, it could begin to make a difference. The world’s establishment media can find cases of this already and simply bring the phenomena to everyone’s attention globally via mass media as well as social media. With very little effort it is possible to inject a little bit more love into the screens that now dominate our lives.

Just a little bit more love could be enough — imagine Archimedes’ lever slightly turning the angle of our world-line just one baby notch, with a little more oxytocin and a little less amygdala — as we endeavor to create a better future for our children’s children’s children.

Love,

Bill

Victoria Cross and George Cross Association

The Victoria Cross and George Cross Association is made up of holders of the Victoria Cross (VC), Britain's highest military award for bravery in the field, and the George Cross (GC), the equivalent award for civilians and military personnel who have displayed conspicuous bravery not in the face of the enemy.

Holders of these awards receive a civil pension and attend reunions which receive much coverage in the national press. Membership is dwindling due to the increasing age of the VC and GC recipients and the tendency until recently of the government to award these medals posthumously.

Canon William Lummis was the chaplain to the Association owing to his extensive research into the Victoria Cross.

Rational design and evaluation of HBsAg polymeric nanoparticles as antigen delivery carriers.
The present work is focused on the development and evaluation of single dose sustained-release Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loaded nanovaccine for Hepatitis B. The conventional treatment suffers from repeated administration and hence requires a booster dose. Therefore, polymeric nanovaccine of HBsAg was developed by double emulsion solvent evaporation technique, utilizing central composite design for formulation optimization. The effects of independent variables (like polymer amount, stabilizer concentration, aqueous/organic phase ratio and homogenizer speed) were also studied on critical quality attributes like particle size and entrapment efficiency. Nanovaccine was characterized in terms of physicochemical parameters, release, internalization and in vivo immunological evaluation in BALB/c mice after administration by different routes such as oral, sub-cutaneous, nasal and intramuscular. The designed nanovaccine demonstrated nanometric size with smooth surface, negative zeta potential, maximum entrapment, sustained release and better internalization in macrophage and MRC-5 cell line. The immune-stimulating activity of nanovaccine administered by different routes was evaluated by measuring anti-HBsAg titre like specific immunoglobulin IgG and IgA response and cytokine level (interleukin-2, interferon-Y) measurement. The results indicated that the nanovaccine administered by intramuscular route produced better humoral as well as cellular responses and potential carriers for antigen delivery at single dose administration via intramuscular route.

Adding SUSHI key to my ErgoDox EZ. My keyboard has a SUSHI key 🍣🍣🍣 pic.twitter.com/TzVhmZuOkf— yhara (Yutaka HARA) (@yhara) 2017年9月27日. I got some cute keycaps at the RubyKaigi 2017. As a natural consequence, I wanted to input a Sushi emoji(U+1F363) by pressing it. Here is how I configured my ErgoDox EZ to do that (Note that steps depend on your OS. The following is steps for macOS.). 1. Configure qmk_firmware. First, you need to add some settings and rebuild qmk_firmware (as you may always do for your ergodox.). This is the patch I used this time.. 2. Enable unicode input of macOS. As noted in docs/unicode.md, go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources, and enable Unicode Hex (which is 「Unicode 16進数」 if your language setting is Japanese.). 3. Set IME. Like this:. 4. Press it!. Now pressing the key should input a Sushi emoji. Note that, however, not all the applications seem to support emoji input. In my environment, it worked for Chrome but not for iTerm2.

Assessing schoolchildren's ability to make proper use of a food and nutrition pyramid.
Being acquainted with nutritional recommendations does not necessarily imply that they are fully understood, nor on how they can be applied when correctly planning an adequate diet. To determine whether children can recognise single portion sizes of various foodstuffs and to test their ability for planning a daily menu in accordance to the guidelines from a Food and Nutrition Pyramid. Subjects under survey were n = 100 children aged 10-11 years, attending two elementary schools: in Warsaw and Piaseczno. The school in Warsaw participated in two national education programmes on food and nutrition (ie. 'Fruit at School' and 'A Glass of Milk') whilst the other did not participate in any such programmes. The study tool was a questionnaire consisting of closed questions together with practical exercises on planning a dietary balanced menu using the Food and Nutrition Pyramid recommendations. Children could easily recognise single portion sizes (73% correct replies), however they found it more difficult to plan a suitable menu, where 60% met the given specifications; ie. numbers of different food type portions, menu diversity, number of meals as well as taking physical activity into account. Girls were significantly better at planning menus. It was also found that, compared to the guidelines, wheat and dairy products, vegetables and fats were under-represented whereas meat and fruit were chosen in excess. Nearly 80% of menus were sufficiently diverse but only 48% were composed of a typical/normal selection of foodstuffs. Despite being provided with guidelines for preparing appropriate menus, most children failed this task. This was likely due to either not fully understanding the instructions or a lack of skills in adopting the Food and Nutrition Pyramid recommendations. Thus it is necessary to give more comprehensive explanations when teaching nutrition during school lessons as well as letting the children practice doing the practical aspects.

Montana Republicans Back Closed Primary Elections. Montana Republicans have resolved to close their primary elections to outsiders and adopt a runoff system for the general election.. The proposals were adopted Saturday by a group of roughly 200 delegates at the party’s election-year convention in Billings. That followed a contentious internal debate that highlights the deep divisions within the state party.. The changes will not go into effect automatically. They would have to be approved by the state Legislature or mandated by a successful federal lawsuit.. Support for closed primary elections was strongest among conservatives. They’ve complained bitterly that some Democrats crossed over during the June 3 primary to vote for moderate Republicans.. Critics warned the move will alienate voters. Great Falls Rep. Steve Fitzpatrick says candidates should concentrate instead on running stronger campaigns.

Freedmen's Aid Society

The Freedmen's Aid Society was founded in 1861 during the American Civil War by the American Missionary Association (AMA), a group supported chiefly by the Congregational, Presbyterian and Methodist churches in the North.  It organized a supply of teachers from the North and provided housing for them, to set up and teach in schools in the South for freedmen and their children. The AMA founded a total of more than 500 schools and colleges for freedmen in the South after the war, so that freedmen could be educated as teachers, nurses and other professionals.

The work of the Society accelerated with the end of the war and the beginning of the Reconstruction era. Education for freedmen was seen as a top priority among both blacks and whites. The Society was supported by a variety of religious groups and denominations, and it began work in the South three months after organizing.  By the end of the first year, it had recruited 52 instructors. The teachers instructed more than 5,000 students in 59 schools.  The schools were open to men, women, and children in the South. By the turn of the century, blacks had raised their rate of literacy by an amazing amount; it was a major success story since the end of the war. By then the Democratic-dominated state legislatures had imposed racial segregation and were underfunding black schools and other facilities.

Leadership and control of the Freedmen's Aid Society has been attributed to both the Congregational and the Methodist Episcopal churches. The Methodist version of the Society's history states that it was founded in 1866. It was "directed by a Board of Managers who were elected by the (Methodist) General Conference." In 1920 it was reorganized and renamed the Board of Education for Negroes, and in 1939 absorbed into the Board of Education of the Methodist Church.

I am perhaps among the rare people who find it difficult to sleep at night because of drinking tea. I have inherited it from my mother. Anyway, it all started 5 years ago when I fell into a bad condition in my career and I had to try desperately to get some work that would bring some money. I was unemployed for 3 months and I gave everything of me during that time. I used to work until 8 AM in morning and then sleep. Then, I developed habit of coffee and coke.. Fortunately, I could give up coffee nearly 18 months ago and Coke nearly 6 months ago. Now, the last thing I need to give up is tea. For the last 3 days, I have not drunk at all. My health has improved a lot and if I can just now change the sleeping habit then I think that I can come back to normal fulltime work. I have learnt my lesson and I will from now try my best to keep my mental peace.. So, for the time being, the only focus is on getting out of drinking tea.

A number of improvements in the technique of artificial insemination of animals have been made in recent years to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of results. An initial problem was the fact that semen could not be efficiently stored for any appreciable length of time. This hurdle was overcome by utilizing a process of freezing the semen at liquid nitrogen temperatures for storage. However, the activity of the semen decreases considerably upon thawing; this decrease in activity is generally attributed to damage occurring to the semen cells during the thawing process. More specifically, a critical period appears to occur during the physical stage when the semen is in a semi-crystalline state, at the transition temperature range from a frozen storage state to a liquid operational state. It has been found that an increase in the rapidity with which the semen is passed through this critical semicrystalline state, results in a corresponding reduction in damage to the cells, and the resulting activity of the semen and success of the insemination is much greater than formerly observed.
In an effort to increase the activity of the thawed semen prior to injection, various expedients are disclosed in the prior art. For example, the semen is inserted into an elongated plastic tube or straw and the straw itself has been decreased in size and mass and designed to expose more surface area of the semen to the heating medium. Ice baths, as well as baths slightly higher in temperature than the ice baths, have been employed in an effort to increase the heat gain of the straw. However, these efforts have generally failed to produce an acceptable level of activity upon thawing of the frozen semen. In general, these prior art efforts allow the semen to remain in the critical temperature range of partially crystalline semen for an unacceptable length of time; and, as mentioned above, an undesirable amount of damage to the semen cells occurs.

U.S. Pat. No. 3.859,527 describes a method for recording and reproducing a high-energy radiation image using a panel for storing a radiation image comprising a stimulable phosphor which emits light when stimulated with visible or infrared radiations after exposure to such radiation (wherein high-energy radiation means an electromagnetic wave or corpuscular radiation such as X-rays, .alpha.-rays, .beta.-rays, .gamma.-rays, neutrons, ultraviolet rays, or the like).
U.S. Pat. No. 4,258,264 describes a method and apparatus for reproducing a radiation image by stimulating a storing phosphor with stimulating rays, the wavelengths of which are in the range from 600 to 700 nm, and detecting the stimulated light by means of a light detector, the detected light being in the range from 300 to 500 nm.
EP 111,893 describes a method for recording and reproducing a radiation image comprising the steps of (i) causing a radiation image storing panel to absorb a radiation after passing through an object, such a panel containing a divalent europium activated barium fluorochloride phosphor, (ii) exposing said panel to an electromagnetic wave having a wavelength in the range from 400 to 550 nm to release the stored radiation energy as fluorescent light and (iii) detecting said fluorescent light.
EP 435,241 describes a phosphor for direct X-ray intensifying screen to be used in combination with a radiographic film comprising a mixture of europium doped barium fluorohalide and niobium doped yttrium metal tantalate.
EP 299,409 describes a radiographic intensifying screen to be used in combination with a radiographic film for direct radiography. The claimed phosphor comprises a mixture of a terbium activated rare earth oxysulfide phosphor and a terbium activated rare earth tantalate complex oxide phosphor.
JP 02/47,185 (1990) describes a method of preparation of a terbium activated rare earth tantalate complex oxide of formula: EQU (L.sub.1-n Tb.sub.n).sub.2 O.sub.3.xTa.sub.2 O.sub.5.yB.sub.2 O.sub.3.zNaF
wherein L is Y, La, Gd or Lu, n=0.005-0.1, x=0.95-1.05, y=0-5.0 and z is a number in order to have up to 0.52% by weight of NaF.
None of the above patent references relating to stimulable phosphors suggests the use of the terbium activated alkali metal tantalates of the present invention in order to obtain a green emitting photostimulable phosphor useful in a method similar to that described in the U.S. Pat. No. 3,859,527 and 4,239,968.

Ruptured Gas-forming Pyogenic Liver Abscess into the Peritoneal Cavity Treated Successfully with Medical Treatment.
Gas-forming pyogenic liver abscess (GFPLA) is very rare and has a very high mortality in case of rupture into the abdominal cavity, which usually require surgical treatment. We experienced a case of a ruptured GFPLA due to Klebsiella pneumoniae complicated with peritonitis and sepsis in a 68-year-old diabetic woman. Immediate and aggressive medical treatments including intravenous antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, and continuous renal replacement therapy dramatically improved the liver abscess, peritonitis, and metabolic problems. We report an unusual case of a ruptured GFPLA without surgical management, treated successfully with only medical treatment.

Determines how well an adhesive "wets-out" or flows uniformly on the surface being bonded to. High surface energy materials, e.g. stainless steel and glass, offer excellent bonding characteristics. Low surface energy materials, e.g. molded polypropylene, resists "wetting-out" and require the use of more aggressive adhesive or a special surface treatment for proper bonding.

Surface energy quantifies the disruption of chemical bonds that occurs when a surface is created. In the physics of solids, surfaces must be intrinsically less energetically favourable than the bulk of a material; otherwise there would be a driving force for surfaces to be created, and surface is all there would be (see sublimation (physics)). Cutting a solid body into pieces disrupts its bonds, and therefore consumes energy.

Effects of education on the prevention of pressure sores.
A controlled study was done to evaluate the efficacy of written guidelines on the prevention of pressure sores. Thirty-three hospitals in Thailand were enrolled from February to April 1991. The incidence of pressure sores in the 6 week control period was 8.7 per cent compared to 6.5 per cent in the study phase. Reduction of the complication was found in all medical, surgical and intensive care departments. Practices on the prevention of pressure sores by nurses were significantly improved regarding: positioning, seating, not pulling, and bed-bathing of patients. Massaging the immobilized parts and the application of supporting devices were not increased by the education programme. This method of education is simple and appropriate for hospitals in Thailand.

Heavy metals uptake by sonicated activated sludge: relation with floc surface properties.
The effects of sonication of activated sludge on heavy metal uptake were in a first time investigated in respect with potential modifications of floc surface properties. The treatment led to the simultaneous increase of specific surface area and of the availability of negative and/or hydrophilic sites. In parallel, organic matter was released in the soluble fraction. Sorption isotherms of cadmium and copper showed that uptake characteristics and mechanisms were highly dependent on both heavy metal species and specific energy supplied. The increase of both specific surface area and fixation sites availability led to the increase of Cd(II) uptake. For Cu(II), organic matter released in soluble phase during the treatment seemed to act as a ligand and to limit adsorption on flocs surface. Three different heavy metals uptake mechanisms have been identified: proton exchange, ion exchange and (co)precipitation.

If the vespa-like scooters — which comfortably seat two and are rented via app — come to D.C., they would be the latest addition to the District's evolving dockless bike and scooter pilot program.

vespa European electric scooter-sharing company Muving is eyeing entry into D.C.s dockless bike and scooter program. The company would introduce vespa-like scooters that comfortably seat two and can be rented via an app. WTOP/Jeff Clabaugh The District Department of Transportation confirms Muving has been in contact, and brought one of its vehicles to D.C. to demonstrate its features.

WASHINGTON — European electric scooter-sharing company Muving is eyeing entry into the District’s dockless bike and scooter program, though it is unclear if or when that might happen.

Muving, which has 2,500 scooters operating in a dozen cities in Europe, entered the U.S. market in July when its scooters hit the street in Atlanta, its first U.S. market. Muving says it is planning operations in additional U.S. cities.

The District Department of Transportation confirms Muving has been in contact, and brought one of its vehicles to D.C. to demonstrate its features — possibly the bright yellow scooter pictured above, photographed on a Connecticut Avenue sidewalk north of Dupont Circle over the weekend.

A Muving spokesperson told WTOP the company cannot disclose details of ongoing discussions with the District.

“It is important to us to partner with the city government and local DOT when considering deploying to ensure we properly follow existing ordinances or help create them for new transportation alternatives being introduced,” Muving’s Diane Maier said.

In Atlanta, like D.C.’s dockless bikes and stand-up scooters, Muving scooters are rented via app and are priced by the minute. The “Muvi” model scooters from Spain-based scooter maker Torrot can comfortably seat two and come with helmets, which are required.

They are available to rent in Atlanta from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Muving would be the latest addition to D.C.’s evolving dockless bike and scooter pilot program.

Ride-hailing company Lyft rolled out its own Lyft-branded stand-up scooters across D.C. this month.

The District continues its pilot program for dockless bikes and scooters until at least the end of the year, but DDOT hopes to have a long-term plan with rules for dockless vehicles hammered out by early next year.

The book has little to say about Justice William Brennan but, as I was reading Rosen, Jim Newton published this terrific three-part series about Brennan over at Slate, and it really brought some clarity to my thinking about the book and the issues it raises.. --Marshal Zeringue

Artificial Sun in his mansion that is turned on 24/7 like the one in Al Gore's mansion.

Have an agreement with the Raptors to fake an injury and sit out 3/4 of the season while collecting his paychecks and while the Toronto fans think that his injury is real since all the news articles would be falsified.

Beasley's face looks kinda scary, anyone else see this? But it can be a good asset for the Raptors since he is not the type to dress all pretty to impress that little wet chic sitting down and deciding on which guy is the cutest.

- He doesn't have to worry about all that pesky media attention he'd receive if he played anywhere in the US. YouTube fame is the future anyways: network television is SO 2008.
- He doesn't have to make any tough decisions about which lucrative endorsement deal to accept. Who wants to be in Gatorade or Adidas commercials anyways?
- He can avoid the inevitable ego trip that results from being voted into the All-Star game by the fans. Being selected by the coaches and coming off the bench is so much better.
- He doesn't have to live anywhere near his family. They're jerks anyways.
- Most importantly: the Toronto NBA franchise is called the Raptors, and he kind of looks like a dinosaur.

Well people do call him Michael Beasley is a Beast; that fits our category quite well . He going to be everyone fan favorite and fan going to cheer LETS GO BEASLEY, LETS GO BEASLEY, sound so much better then RAPTOR doesn't it?

Reasons for Bosh to stay:
1. Bigger paycheque.
2. Being with one team. The team that put their faith in him to be 'the man'.
3. Living in Toronto (depending how much he likes Toronto)
4. friends on his team (depending on how much he likes his teammates)
5. Bigger paycheque (you're foolish if you think this doesn't trump a lot of stuff).

In the end of the day, i don't think Bosh is worthy of the Max, so if for some reason he doesn't come back, then i will be fine with it. I mean we're not on pace to make the finals or anything... and that's with Bosh on the team. If it ain't the best recipe for success, it won't kill us to try another recipe.

I don't have a problem if Bosh leaves, in fact if a S&T can get done i pretty much hope for it. As much as i like Bosh, it isn't working with him. He's been surrounded with decent talent the last 4 seasons for the most part, more then Wade in Miami (post championship) and almost as much as Lebron who at this point doesn't exactly have a great team around him imo. But the difference is they've led their teams further then they probably should have gone by making their teammates better. Bosh not so much.

If you truly believe that then I don't know what to say.

The Raps haven't had anything CLOSE to another all-star player to pair with Bosh and THAT's what you need if you're going beyond the first round of the playoffs. Some of our past teams have been good enough to MAKE the playoffs.. but that's it. Once teams have doubled and tripled Bosh who's been good enough to do anything? NO ONE.

What has Wade done without Shaq?

What did Kobe do until Pau and Odom got there?

Lebron is a once in a generation player.... if you're going to compare every player to him then you're going to be disappointed.

I really liked Arkanea by Lynette Noni. I liked the creativeness she put into creating the setting, characters, and food. It was very descriptive, but not to the point where it bored me with details. The characters were developed nicely. I enjoyed finding out more about Medora and its history. I did not like how she didn't explain Medora. It may have made more sense if more details were included.. The setting was so well described, I could imagine myself there. There were times that I thought I could see exactly what was happening extremely clearly. The characters felt like they could be real people, that is if they didn't have their special gifts. I could imagine this book becoming very famous. It is a great piece of literature and I hope it is widely read.

Brickyard Plantation- Americus- 229-874-1234. 1619 U.S. 280 East, Americus, GA 31709. In 1977 plans were made for a 7 acre pond to be built for fishing. A friend suggested a couple of golf holes be built around the lake. This catapulted into 9 holes and then came the question of a name for the course. When construction of the pond began the kiln and other artifacts of brick making were discovered. This is where the brick came from for the buildings on the plantation. Many years before removal of dirt from that wet weather hole had created a swimming hole which the local kids referred to as the “Brickyard Hole”. For want of a name, the second golf course ever built in Sumter County was called Brickyard Plantation Golf Club. Today it is a semi-private course and welcomes all to come play this challenging 27 hole facility.

Senegal: Ministry of Petroleum and Energy increases budget. With the rising potential of Senegal’s oil exploration, Minister of Petroleum and Energy, H.E Mansour Elimane Kane announced a budget increase for the sector.. As the West African nation works to develop its petroleum sector, its allocated budget will increase from c. $202 875 268,19 million to $246580271,85 million in 2019.. According to reports, the petroleum and energy ministry is expected to find a balance between the exploitation of energy and the desire or commitment of the state to management the country’s resources properly.. Last month, Minister Kane met with Nigeria’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama to enlist Nigeria’s assistance as the country develops its petroleum sector.. “As you know, we just discovered a lot of oil and gas and we would want to take advantage of the experience from Nigeria,” the minister said.

Asaram aide arrested for abetting crime

Jodhpur Police on Monday arrested a close aide of Asaram for abetment of crime.

Shiva - the personal care-taker of the self-styled spiritual preacher – had surrendered before police on Saturday after jumping summons for questioning on August 29 last and police was interrogating him for the past three days.

“During his interrogation it was revealed that Shiva had knowledge of everything related to the case, but he did not act,” DCP Ajay Pal Lamba told Hindustan Times, adding that he would be produced in court on Tuesday.

It was Shiva who had allegedly suggested to the parents of the victim to come to Jodhpur for meeting Asaram. According to police, Shiva had not only managed their entry into Manai ashram, where Asaram was based at that time, but also arranged their meeting with him.

He was named in the FIR filed by victim. The FIR also names the victim’s hostel warden Shilpi, who is also on the run after being summoned by police for questioning.

Asaram was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days by a Jodhpur court and has been lodged in the Jodhpur central jail.

Background description includes information that may be useful in understanding the present invention. It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art or relevant to the presently claimed invention, or that any publication specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.
Porous semiconductors are promising material in comparison to bulk materials as they offer high surface to volume ratio. It enhances their optoelectronic properties, as well as lattice mismatch, and can be handled by controlling their porosity that significantly alters the band gap present in them. Among them, Group III nitrides exhibit high saturation voltage, high thermal stability and wide band gaps ranging from 3.4 eV for GaN up to 6.2 eV for AIN in the case of wurtzite crystal structure.
Recently, GaN micro- and nanostructures, such as porous layers and nanowire arrays, have attracted great researchers because of their distinct properties such as enhanced luminescence, high sensitivity and selectivity in chemical sensing, low dislocation density, relaxing lattice and thermal mismatch-induced strain and suppressing quantum confined stark effect in lnGaN/GaN quantum wells, from a bulk or an epitaxial thin film.
Over the last decade, huge research is being done on gas sensing semiconductors materials such as ZnO and SnO2. Among these gas sensor materials, Group III-nitride is of great importance as they can work in severe climatic conditions such as high/low temperature, high humidity etc. Group III-nitride such as GaN with different morphologies such as porous structures, nanowires, and nanotubes etc. has been synthesized, and are investigated for gas sensing properties. Colloidal graphite grown on GaN substrate has been used as H2 gas sensor, and it demonstrated a limit response to exposure of 100 ppm H2/N2. Pd/AIGaN/GaN field effect transistor (FET) hetero-structure was used as an H2 gas detector and showed lower limit less than 1 ppm. A sensitivity of 4% is measured from metal composite nanoclusters on GaN nanowires when exposed to 1 ppm H2/N2 at room temperature.
In last few years, passivation of GaN has been thoroughly explored to handle the issues such as current leakage, carriers trapping in light emitting devices and enhancing the conduction mechanism in high electron mobility transistors. Sulfur-based compounds such as sodium sulfide and ammonium sulfide are mainly used due to their strong bonding with III-V semiconductor; in particular, octadecylthiol (ODT) and thioacetamide (TAM) have been employed to treat GaP, GaN, and GaAs. Nanostructures of GaN, as well as its epitaxial layers, have been passivated with inorganic sulfides to explore the effect of passivation on the gas sensor. However, to the best of knowledge of inventors of the present application, the conventional sensors and methods of detecting gas(es) suffers from a disadvantage that they could not achieve the desired performance characteristics.
There is therefore a need in the art of a gas sensor that can overcome the limitations associated with conventional sensors while exhibiting high sensitivity of gas detection under different temperate conditions. The present invention satisfies the existing needs, inter alia, others and provides H2 gas sensor that is highly sensitive at room temperature.

Welcome to Dracula country!

Mike with Vladimirthe Impaler

Ever wondered where Dracula came from? Well, he's from Transylvania... which is in central Romania, and we will not just take you there, we will even show you his castle. A beautiful castle. Transylvania is not only a beautiful part of the world, it's also a mythical place. We went there with a Romanian escort! Roxy, Andrei and Olivia rode with us to Transylvania, showed us where to go, how to get there and the sights to see. We were in for a treat, a couple of beautiful days into the mythical land called Transylvania...! It was to be our first proper view of Romania and what an eye-opener!

What do you do when a couple of total strangers turn up at your friend's doorstep? You take them for a 750 km roundtrip through Romania...! Stay overnight in a Romanian Pension with them, take them out for dinner, show them Dracula's castle and ride up the Transfăgărășan pass with them even though it is still covered in snow! The friendliness of Romanian motorcyclists is amazing. We had already found the Romanians very enthusiastic about what we are doing, which started at the first day we rode into Romania. Total strangers came up to us for a photo and a chat as they had been following our blog and wanted to know more about our trip. But Roxy, Andrei and Olivia's friendliness completely astounded us.

Dracula's chair...not the most comfortable but atleast you wouldn't sit therefor long...

Home made cheese...!

They took us on a private tour through the Carpathian mountains towards Brasov and Sibiu. For those wondering what the Carpathian mountains are: they are the second largest mountain range in Europe, second only to the Scandinavian mountain range. The Carpathian mountains boast some impressive mountains, with peaks as high as 2,600 mtr. They are home to bears, wolves and lynxes, the highest concentration of which can be found right here in Romania.

We were shown the real Romania, with its castles, its characterful villages, its horse drawn carts and it's cuisine! The weather forecast hadn't been that good for the weekend and sure enough it came down in bucket loads on Saturday afternoon. Our hosts thought we were crazy when we suggested a campground... little did we know that a Pension in Romania works out cheaper than a campground and even comes with your own shower. The rain cleared quickly so we went into town to sample Romania cuisine, which is great!

War memorial 1916-1918

As luck would have it, it was also museum night. We could thus roam around in Dracula's castle for instance. For the nitpickers: the castle's official name is Bran Castle and the count who lived there was Vladimir the impaler, however it's known world wide as Dracula's Castle.

The second day of the weekend was to be a ride from Bran to Sibiu, via the perhaps most famous pass of Romania: the Transfăgărășan pass.

The pass wasn't open yet due to an abundance of snow, but we went up as far as we could and had a super-ride. The Transfăgărășan pass in the snow: what more could we ask for? We rode past the concrete barrier, riding twisty roads flanked by snow right up to the point where we ran into a snow barrier. A great ride. In theory you should be here in June or July, when the pass is open. However that's also the time when there will be a lot of holiday makers. We had the pass virtually to ourselves and the views were magic!

The end of the road...

Our weekend had already been super, but Andrei, Olivia and Roxy had one more surprise in store. We were going to part company in Sibiu, they would head back to Bucharest, we would continue on our own towards the west. They contacted a friend in Sibiu, Radu, who was waiting fur us and guided us to a restaurant. We had a good meal, good conversation and then said, temporarily, goodbye to Roxy, Andrei and Olivia. Radu showed us the sights of Sibiu and subsequently took us to a guesthouse via a very scenic route. Camping really is pointless here as guesthouse charge less for a two person room than campings charge per tent. We were met by a very friendly family and Radu organised a full breakfast for us as well. Romania is a very, very friendly place! It was an amazing trip through an amazing country; the perfect weekend!

Rita Sattler, PhD. Barrow Neurological Institute. Mechanisms of GluA2 editing deficiencies in C9orf72. The goal of this proposal is to study cellular and molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis induced by the novel C9orf72 mutation found to be highly prevalent in ALS patients. In specific, we aim to test the hypothesis that mutations in the C9orf72 gene lead to significant changes in the cellular structure of fine projections of neurons, so called axons and dendrites, which are important for the transmission of information from one cell to another. Preliminary data from our laboratory suggest that there is a structural rearrangement of the dendritic synapse, a specialized structure along those neuronal processes where cell to cell information exchange occurs, but also where memories are formed and lost, as is the case during cognitive impairment, which is frequently observed in C9orf72 ALS patients.. Note: Funding for this project is made possible by Ride For Life.

Medical school applications reach new high

The number of first-time applicants to allopathic medical schools reached an all-time high of 32,654 students, a 2.6% rise from 2010, said an Assn. of American Medical Colleges report released in October.

Enrollment in medical schools grew at its fastest rate, 3%, since the turn of the century. More than 19,000 medical students matriculated in 2011, reflecting a nationwide push for expanded enrollment and students’ interest in a career as a physician.

Q:

Is there a way to specify exact path to "client_secret.json"

Im new to this stuff and i really don't know what to do now, i need to be able to type exact path to "client_secret.json" file but in every tutorial i saw it only uses file name that is in same directory, but mine isn't.
creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('client_secret.json', scope)

A:

Yes, anywhere that accepts a filename will accept an absolute or relative pathway. You are talking about relative pathways (being in the same directory), and you can use these like:
creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('../client_secret.json', scope)

Where the ../ specifies to go up one folder and then look for your file. Additionally you could use an absolute pathway like:
creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('C:\\Users\\myUser\\Desktop\\client_secret.json', scope)

It's typically recommended to use relative pathways though, because that enables you to move your entire project folder to another place/drive without breaking all your links.
Relative pathways can also navigate up and down the tree like:
creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('../../../SomeFolder/SubFolder/client_secret.json', scope)



Amyloid fibril formation by A beta 16-22, a seven-residue fragment of the Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide, and structural characterization by solid state NMR.
The seven-residue peptide N-acetyl-Lys-Leu-Val-Phe-Phe-Ala-Glu-NH(2), called A beta(16-22) and representing residues 16-22 of the full-length beta-amyloid peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease, is shown by electron microscopy to form highly ordered fibrils upon incubation of aqueous solutions. X-ray powder diffraction and optical birefringence measurements confirm that these are amyloid fibrils. The peptide conformation and supramolecular organization in A beta(16-22) fibrils are investigated by solid state (13)C NMR measurements. Two-dimensional magic-angle spinning (2D MAS) exchange and constant-time double-quantum-filtered dipolar recoupling (CTDQFD) measurements indicate a beta-strand conformation of the peptide backbone at the central phenylalanine. One-dimensional and two-dimensional spectra of selectively and uniformly labeled samples exhibit (13)C NMR line widths of <2 ppm, demonstrating that the peptide, including amino acid side chains, has a well-ordered conformation in the fibrils. Two-dimensional (13)C-(13)C chemical shift correlation spectroscopy permits a nearly complete assignment of backbone and side chain (13)C NMR signals and indicates that the beta-strand conformation extends across the entire hydrophobic segment from Leu17 through Ala21. (13)C multiple-quantum (MQ) NMR and (13)C/(15)N rotational echo double-resonance (REDOR) measurements indicate an antiparallel organization of beta-sheets in the A beta(16-22) fibrils. These results suggest that the degree of structural order at the molecular level in amyloid fibrils can approach that in peptide or protein crystals, suggest how the supramolecular organization of beta-sheets in amyloid fibrils can be dependent on the peptide sequence, and illustrate the utility of solid state NMR measurements as probes of the molecular structure of amyloid fibrils. A beta(16-22) is among the shortest fibril-forming fragments of full-length beta-amyloid reported to date, and hence serves as a useful model system for physical studies of amyloid fibril formation.

While Millennials and Gen-Xers make up a good chunk of the cannabis market, Baby Boomers are consuming marijuana more frequently than ever before, according to a report published in June.. Marijuana demographics. According to the study examining patterns of cannabis consumption among Americans aged 50 and older, use increased more than 70 percent between 2006 and 2013. The data also revealed that “a larger proportion of adults in the older adult population used marijuana medicinally in contrast to recreational use.”. The review of demographic data compiled between 2000-2017 and analyzed by a team of researchers from the University of Florida was published in the journal Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine... Baby Boomers came of age in Age of Aquarius.

Wi-Fi power to eight more suburban stations in Mumbai

Indian Railways on Monday launched free Wi-Fi facility at eight suburban stations in the metropolis coupled with a host of other passenger amenities at various destinations.

Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu who inaugurated the broadband internet facility at eight major stations reaffirmed that his ministry was doing every bit to ease the commute and
raise the bar of comfort for rail passengers.

Of the eight Wi-Fi powered stations, five, including Churchgate, Bandra, Bandra Terminus, Dadar (WR) and Khar Road, are on the Western Railway line, while the rest — Kalyan,
Lokmanya Tilak Terminus and Dadar (CR)– are on Central Railway line.

The Wi-Fi services are being provided under ‘RailWire’, which has been designed to offer users the best and fastest internet experience to anyone who has a smartphone.

About 17 suburban stations in Mumbai have been chosen for installation of the Wi-Fi facility, which is being provided by RailTel at a speed of 1 gbps.

While Mumbai Central is already Wi-Fi enabled, the work for providing Wi-Fi at eight more suburban stations is underway.

“This facility shall enable our railway passengers to remain connected, get railway related and other information online while waiting for the train,” according to a Railway presentation at the inauguration event.

Among other passengers amenities, Prabhu dedicated the two new harbour line platforms (which are 270 metre long and can accommodate 12 coaches trains) constructed at Andheri station.

He also inaugurated two new harbour platforms along with elevated deck and passenger amenities as well as booking offices at Goregaon station.

He inaugurated a foot overbridge at extreme north of Vasai station along with an escalator, a foot overbridge at north end of Nallasopara station and an escalator, new foot overbridges on Mumbai Division (CR) such as in Karjat, King Circle, Chembur, Shahad, Reay Road and Kasaiwada (Kurla).

He also threw open an AC dormitory for ladies (20 beds) and gents (54 beds) at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus built at an approximate cost of Rs one crore

Laser apparatus is usually part of an optical system for performing some operation using the laser apparatus. Such operations include laser machining, optical inspection of semiconductor circuits, interferometry, and microscopy. Because of this, there is a constant demand to reduce the size of laser apparatus, for example, for correspondingly reducing the size, or for increasing the portability of the overall optical system.
One approach to reducing the size of laser apparatus is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,952,806, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and the complete disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In this apparatus the output of four semiconductor lasers, each emitting radiation of a different color is combined to provide illumination for microscopy. The apparatus is housed in an enclosure divided into three compartments arranged one above another. Lasers are located in a base compartment, electronics are located on the floor of the next compartment, and a beam combining arrangement including a compact, monolithic, pentagonal beam-combining prism is mounted on the floor of the upper compartment.
A limit to compactness in this arrangement is that the area of footprint of the enclosure is determined by the area required of the biggest compartment. Vertical floor-spacing is determined by the tallest compartment on any one floor. In order to achieve any further compacting, a more flexible approach to such housing or packaging is required.

A lifelong New Jerseyan -- he grew up in Cumberland County and moved to the Middlesex/Somerset area when he went to college at Rutgers University -- he wants to make sure that state government works as well as possible.. Paff started working with the Forfeiture Endangers American Rights, a group looking to reform federal and state asset forfeiture laws, in 1992, and then moved to trying to improve attorney ethics before landing on open government issues. He now chairs the New Jersey Libertarian Party's Open Government Advocacy Project and is a member of the board of directors of the New Jersey Foundation for Open Government.

New Delhi: More than 12,000 farmers killed themselves in Maharashtra between 2015 and 2018, the legislative assembly was informed on Friday.

During the three year period, 12,021 farmer took their own lives, which adds up to more than eight deaths every day. Of these cases, 6,888 were found to be eligible for government aid after scrutiny by district-level committees, Relief and rehabilitation minister Subhash Deshmukh told the House in a written reply.

With Maharashtra reeling under a severe drought and agrarian crisis, the legislative council was discussing the condition. Mahrashtra has historically been a state where a large number of farmers take their own lives every year.

The state is also set to have elections to the assembly later this year. This has prompted a political battle over where the blame lies on the condition of the farmers.

Opposition leader Jayant Patil said, “We have always drawn the attention of the government towards agrarian crisis. Whether it is loan waiver or crop loan they are not reaching all the needy farmers. Thus, pushing them in greater financial distress leading to such extreme steps.”

Speaking in the legislative assembly, Deshmukh said so far, family members of 6,845 farmers have been given financial assistance of Rs 1 lakh each. Between January and March 2019, 610 farmers died by suicide, out of which 192 cases were eligible for financial assistance, the minister said.

Of the 192 eligible cases, financial compensation has been given to the kin of 182 farmers, Deshmukh said. The remaining cases are being scrutinised to check their eligibility for compensation, he said.

While the Maharashtra government has been waiving loans of farmers, it does not seem to have eased the agrarian crisis. In 2017, when a loan waiver was announced, 4,500 farmer suicides were reported.

MLK Day March remarks

Good morning. My name is Michael Schill. I am the president of the University of Oregon. Thank you, Eric Richardson, for inviting me to speak today. What a great and inspiring day this is!

I cannot think of a better way to celebrate the teachings and strive for the aspirations of Dr. Martin Luther King Junior — than by walking hand in hand with my neighbors, community partners, colleagues, students and friends.

We stand united in our belief that we must do much more to make Dr. King’s dream of equity, justice, inclusion and diversity a reality. The University of Oregon is committed to this work, not just because it is right and just, but because adhering to these values make us a better institution and are essential to our mission of teaching, research and service.

Listening to the words of the many speakers here and seeing the faces of the many young people who marched through town this morning, I am moved and inspired. I hear in their voices and see in their eyes determination and hope, resilience and passion, but also trepidation. This is also what I hear and see from many of our students at the University of Oregon.

I have learned a lot from our Black students and other students of color at the UO over the last year and a half as president. I’ve learned from our Black faculty, staff and community members as well.

In fact, I think and hope the entire University of Oregon community and people our nation have had their eyes opened wide about the continuing legacy of racism and bigotry in America thanks to the Black Lives Matter movement. These lessons are ongoing, but we know that education and understanding is an important step in making change.

I’d like to share with you some of the lessons I and the UO community have learned in the last year.

I have learned a lot of about the unique experiences of our Black students, faculty and staff. I’ve spent a good part of my life as an attorney, professor, and academic leader working to ensure access, equity, and justice in housing and education for underrepresented populations. I’ve lived and taught in Philadelphia, New York, Chicago and LA., but living in Eugene and leading our university has offered a whole new perspective.

What many of our students have told me is that when they look around and see very few people who look like they do, or find very few people who have similar backgrounds, it is extremely alienating and isolating. They feel that they are repeatedly called upon to represent their race, a burden that their white counterparts do not share.

And those white students, they themselves are harmed by our lack of diversity. The genius of American higher education is that we learn from each other. Without sufficient diversity, all students are shortchanged.

I have also learned that actions speaker louder than words.

As many of you many remember in the fall of 2015, a group of students under the banner of the Black Students Task Force, rallied on our campus and presented me with a list of demands. I meet with and correspond with our Black student leaders many regularly, and today I walked with them, and they have made it very clear that they want to see progress.

Last spring year we announced that we were moving forward with many of the demands and we implemented a series of change on our campus including:

We removed the name of a Ku Klux Klan leader from one of the resident halls on campus.

We expanded efforts to attract and recruit African American and Black students through a new African American Opportunities Program.

We have invited six Black Greek letter organizations to the UO.

We have created an African American residential student community. The Umoja Pan-African Scholars Academic Residential Community is now home to 25 scholars in the Living-Learning Center.

We are creating new African American advisory boards for retention and advising, as part of our student leadership teams.

We launched an African American lecture series on campus. Our fourth speaker, acclaimed author Ta-Nehisi Coates, will be on campus next month.

We expanded information about the demographics of the populations of our campus and posted it online.

And the College of Arts and Sciences has established a new African American cluster faculty hiring program focused on Black literature, history and women and gender studies.

For all of these initiatives, we are working hard to ensure that these changes are meaningful, lasting and not merely symbolic.

I have also learned that change takes more than just desire and commitment, it needs planning, resources and action.

To that end, the University of Oregon has developed a strategic framework called IDEAL for implementing our institutional goals of hiring more diverse faculty and staff, attracting more diverse students, helping these students succeed, and making our teaching and research more inclusive, equitable and diverse.

We have challenged and required all of the leaders of our units and schools at the UO—our deans, vice presidents and the president too—to tell us how they are going to achieve these goals and how we can hold them accountable if they do not. These diversity action plans are due in spring and meaningful change must start right away.

Another lesson of the last year, these issues are hard and nuanced. Being well intentioned is not enough. We must seek input, perspective and consider the impact of our actions.

As many of you know, when a law professor chose to dress in blackface at a Halloween party in a misguided attempt to draw attention to the lack of black doctors, she deeply hurt and offended many people in our community.

She forced our campus to take a hard look at how we balance the essential need of freedom of expression and academic freedom with the rights of our students to be free from racial harassment.

I may have the right to express my opinion, even controversial opinions because that is at the core of our ability to learn and question, but I do not have the right through my speech to deny you your right be free from racial harassment.

A final lesson I have learned in the last year is how smart, courageous and strategic our black students and their allies are. They have challenged the status quo in a way that balanced their desire for change with an understanding of how institutions work. In doing this, they have made more progress than I guess they ever could have expected.

More needs to be done at the University of Oregon. And Lord knows, more needs to be done to make Martin Luther King’s dream a reality.

I look forward to working with our students, our faculty and our community on this mission. Thank you.

Agriculture and Fisheries Council

The Agriculture and Fisheries Council (AGRIFISH) is one of the configurations of the Council of the European Union and is composed of the agriculture and fisheries ministers of the 27 European Union member states. Its competencies include the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), among others.

Composition
Agrifish is composed of the agriculture and fisheries ministers of the 27 European Union member states. While most member states send one minister for both sectors, others send one minister for agriculture and another for fisheries.

The European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development and the European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries also participate in the meetings.

Tasks
The agriculture part of the Council covers legislation relating to:

 the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP);
 internal market rules;
 forestry;
 organic production;
 quality of production and food and feed safety; and
 harmonisation of rules concerning veterinary matters, animal welfare, plant health, animal feed, seeds and pesticides.

The fisheries part of the Council covers legislation relating to:

 the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP);
 fisheries;
 the setting of annual Total Allowable Catches (TACs);
 quotas for each species; and
 fishing effort limits.

Legislative procedure
Since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Council takes its decisions on most agriculture and fisheries legislation in co-decision with the European Parliament according to the ordinary legislative procedure, except with respect to decisions on annual fishing opportunities where the Council decides on its own.

Administration
The work and tasks of the Council concerning agriculture is prepared by the Special Committee on Agriculture (SCA), composed of senior agriculture officials from the member states and European Commission. The work and tasks of the Council concerning fisheries is prepared by the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER), composed of fisheries experts from the member states and European Commission.

Within the Council Secretariat, the work and tasks of the Council is prepared by the Directorate-General for Agriculture, Fisheries, Social Affairs and Health.

Pick a town that would buy the farm produce your planning to pursue at the highest prices.Place your headquarters within that city’s permit area and simply use 1 or 2 of your first unlocks on the easiest to produce yet highest priced farm produce.Get urban roads quickly as they are cheap to research and provide a large speed boost for your trucks.Find a nice piece of water close to town and setup your water siphons and fields. Using a warehouse is optional at this point it's really up to you. Based upon the requested amounts of farm produce, expand your fields to meet the towns’ request ed amount of food every 15 days.The maximum in the early game is 12 of each product every 15 days. Slowly research and expand production to additional kinds of requested farm produce bit by bit.Taking out a loan maybe needed to keep enough working capital on-hand for the beginning of the next month. Try to get a 10m loan with the longest possible duration (lower monthly payments) as 5m is just too small of a loan to consider.After you've fully supplied the town’s produce requests, there should be roughly 250-450k population within the town. This amount of growth depends on the town’s starting situation and a few other factors.This is when you should start having more than enough money for R&D to go after higher tiers of product, transportation vehicles, and increased distribution technologies.Start producing t2 products, or easy t3 like brandy to sell to more advanced stores than Farmer’s Markets or Hardware stores.Setup trade routes to sell your higher tier products to farther away towns (less than 250 tiles) in increase your profits. A liquor store that is close by (less than 250 tiles) will be an extremely easy source of revenue as producing high tier liquors requires just a few basic lumber related production lines. Pursuing this will allow you to sell great liquors as well as early grades of lumber products for a very nice profit.If advanced stores are farther than 250 tiles, I would recommend producing other products that are closer by.At this point it's really up to you where to go from. By going through the game in a similar way as I described you will always have a profit with only 3 fields and 3 water harvesters per water siphon.It's a great way to start developing your strategies and skills for Rise of Industry, and will ensure you hold a steady early game profit that will provide a backbone for your later game success.Keep in mind this a basic strategy designed to help with understanding how production lines work, how to turn a profit, and how cities may or may not grow based off of your influence via product sales.

An absence of negative credit history must be shown to qualify for this loan. The maximum PLUS loan amount is calculated by subtracting the total aid awarded to the student from the cost of attendance. To request the PLUS loan, please visit. If a parent of a dependent student is denied a PLUS loan, the student may be eligible for additional unsubsidized Stafford Loans. PLUS loans must be applied for each year, as they are not automatically renewed.

A stonemason was engaged the other day in cutting. out a round ball for the purpose of some architectural decoration, when. a smart schoolboy came upon the scene.. "Look here," said the mason, "you seem to be a. sharp youngster, can you tell me this?. If I placed this ball on the. level ground, how many other balls of the same size could I lay around. it (also on the ground) so that every ball should touch this one?". The boy at once gave the correct answer, and then. put this little question to the mason:. "If the surface of that ball contained just as. many square feet as its volume contained cubic feet, what would be the. length of its diameter?". The stonemason could not give an answer.. Could you. have replied correctly to the mason's and the boy's questions?. See answer

The easiest and least expensive method to test for Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD).. 8-10 million Americans have PAD. Without proper treatment, 30% are likely to die in 5 years of PAD-related heart attack or stroke. PAD is a condition in which fatty deposits build up on the inner linings of arteries, and restrict the flow of blood to muscles and organs; especially the kidneys, stomach, arms, legs and feet. A PADnet test measures the blood volume in the patient’s extremities by using a series of blood pressure readings. This non-invasive test can be completed in 15-20 minutes at CMMC. This vascular test can also check for Peripheral Venous Disease (PVD) – a general term for damage, defects or blockage in the peripheral veins, most commonly found in the arms and legs (like varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency)..

09.. The project-measures will first provide full information about the nutritional status of the European adolescents including. - Dietary intake, nutrition knowledge and eating attitudes. - Food choices and preferences. - Body composition. - Plasma lipids and metabolic profile. - Vitamin status. - Immune function related to nutritional status. - Physical activity and fitness. - Genotype (to analyse gene-nutrient and gene-environment interactions). In the following steps HELENA will identify the requirements for the promotion of healthy foods and will develop three sensory acceptable products for adolescents.. Finally this project helps to understand why health-related messages have not been as effective as expected in the adolescent population. In addition HELENA will create a realistic intervention strategy to achieve the goals of understanding and effectively enhancing nutritional and lifestyle habits of adolescents in Europe..

My boss uses the quote above all the time. He’s used it in conjunction with “Put your opinion down and step away from the designer” as he slowly backed away from my cubicle. I laugh, but at the time I knew I was a little fiery with the redundancy of changes being requested. The battle between good design and opinion rages on. Thus, your opinion, although interesting, is perhaps irrelevant when it comes to the philosophy and logic that lies behind good, intentional, meaningful design.. Designers, set your ego down. Non-designers, tuck your opinion into your back pocket and step away.. My boss was a wise man.. Advertisements

APPLETON (WKOW) -- An Appleton company is donating one of its unique modular homes to an Oklahoma family who lost their house in the recent tornado.. The owner of "MODS International" decided to haul one of his four-person units to help out in El Reno.. "When they've lost everything, you know, they need to start somewhere. So, we have several units on hand just for that purpose." 19:10 "so, we decided to take and donate one unit," said MODS International owner, Doug Larson.. "The whole concept with these is that they really can be placed anywhere 18:04 because of the type of unit it is, you know, we can put this thing in somebody's driveway and plug it into the existing structure," said company development manager, Brian Fezatte.. The company owner says the modular units are different from a mobile home in that they're durable, can withstand strong winds and can even be stacked on top of another.

Northwestern Players Win First Step Towards Unionization. ABC Digital. National Sports. Updated at. iStockPhoto/Thinkstock(CHICAGO) — The National Labor Relations Board in Chicago ruled on Wednesday that Northwestern football players qualify as employees of the school and can unionize. The university says they will appeal the decision to the full NLRB in Washington, D.C.. In siding with the athletes, Peter Sung Ohr, the regional director of the NLRB, said the amount of time the players dedicate to their sport, and the fact that their scholarships are tied directly to how they perform, are reasons for giving them union rights.. Former Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter along with the College Athletes Players Association and the United Steelworkers union brought the case to the NLRB. Ohr says the players can hold a vote on whether they want to be represented by the CAPA.. The federal labor agency does not have jurisdiction over public universities.. Respond to this story

Relatively small cars have become increasingly popular, due to road congestion and the maintenance cost of vehicles. In order to save space, the trunks of smaller cars are appreciatively small as well, and furthermore, some such cars have no trunks at all.
A trailer is a well known solution to the object of increasing the carrying ability of a car.
FIG. 1 schematically illustrates a trailer 90, according to the prior art.
The trailer comprises a platform 94 with two wheels 92. The chassis 93 at the front side thereof outstands from the platform in order to allow a user to connect it to a car hitch (not illustrated in this figure).
US20060228201 is considered by the Applicant as the closest prior art. It discloses a portable cart which has an extendable base to elevate the cart to a proper height in order to mount it in the receiver or a trailer hitch. The extendable base is retracted, pulling up the cart wheels. This allows the cart to be towed by a vehicle. Once at the desired location, the vehicle is parked. The extendable base is extended to support the weight of the cart, which is removed from the vehicle. The cart may then be lowered and wheeled to its user site. The cart may be designed to hold baseball equipment, act as a sports training cart with first aid supplies, or material spill cleanup equipment. It may also carry food and supplies for catering, contain an outdoor mobile grill, act as a service company cart, a construction cart, an equipment cart for first responders, a pet show cart, a trade show cart, or be armored to carry ammunition and military supplies.
US20080100076 A1 is also considered by the applicant as close prior art. It discloses a cargo carrying system for use with a vehicle. The system includes a platform having roller members on an underside thereof to facilitate movement of the platform along the ground. Also included is a connection assembly which serves to permit the attachment of the platform to a vehicle. In one embodiment, both a first height adjustment mechanism and a separate, finely adjustable height mechanism are included between the connection assembly and the platform. Further included is an intermediate, slidable member used between the platform and connection member to facilitate the connection of the platform to the vehicle.
All the solutions described above have not yet provided satisfactory solutions to the problem of the required space between the car and the trailer, in order to allow a user to connect and disconnect the trailer from the car.
It is an object of the present invention to provide a solution to the above-mentioned and other problems of the prior art.
Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent as the description proceeds.

According to prior art practice, ornaments, for example, glass crystals, are typically arranged in chandeliers and other ornamental fixtures using wire-like connectors or connectors produced as stampings from metal sheets or plate. Prior art connectors are typically threaded through perforations in adjacent ornaments to “string” the ornaments together. U.S. Pat. No. 3,629,571 of Schonbek discloses one such connector for arranging ornamental crystals for use in chandeliers, among other fixtures. Though conventional connectors and means for connecting ornaments are very effective when mounting ornaments, conventional connectors can have limitations when providing longer strings of ornaments or connecting larger ornaments, for example, for large chandeliers.
The limitations of conventional ornament connectors are particularly acute as the number and size of ornaments being connected increases, for example, as the size of a chandelier increases. Ever increasing customer demands for larger and more elaborate chandeliers tax the capability and desirability of conventional ornament connectors. For example, the capability and desirability of present ornament connector design is typically exceeded as the size of a chandelier exceeds 10 feet in diameter. For instance, as the diameter of the chandelier increases, the length of a “chain” or “run” of ornaments mounted on the chandelier increases and the tendency for the ornaments to twist or become misaligned increases. Large diameter chandeliers may have runs of ornaments of over 10 feet or more. Such long runs of ornaments are prone to unsightly twisting when conventional connecting methods and connectors are used. The realignment of such twisted chains is typically time consuming and, often, ineffective in providing the proper orientation of the ornaments desired.
Also, as the size of chandeliers increase, the size of the ornaments typically used also increases. This also taxes present ornament connector design. Specifically, as the size of a chandelier increases, the size of the ornaments mounted on the large chandelier must be increased to maintain the aesthetic qualities of the chandelier. For example, small ornaments simply are not aesthetically appealing when mounted on large chandeliers. Large chandeliers are typically mounted in large rooms and are typically viewed from larger distances than small chandeliers. As a result, to ensure that the aesthetics of individual ornaments or chains of ornaments are distinguishable on such large chandeliers, the ornaments themselves must typically be made larger. Typically, as the size of the ornaments increases, the weight of the ornament also increases. The increased weight of larger ornaments, for example, larger glass crystal ornaments, can exceed the load capacity of conventionally connected ornament chains.
The present invention overcomes these and other limitations in prior art ornament connectors, for example, especially for ornaments mounted on large chandeliers.

HPJava allows to construct sections of global arrays. The syntax of section subscripting uses double brackets. The subscripts can be scalar (integers or locations) or triplets.. Suppose we still have array a and c defined as above, then, a[[i]], c, c[[i, 1::2]], and c[[i, :]] are all array sections. Here i is a location in the first range of a and c (it could also be an integer in the appropriate interval). Both the expressions c[[i, 1::2]] and c[[i, :]] represent one-dimensional distributed arrays, providing aliases for subsets of the elements in c. The expression a[[i]] contains a single element of a, but the result is a global scalar reference (unlike the expression a[i] which is a simple variable).. Array section expressions are often used as arguments in function. calls2. Table 1 shows the type. signatures of global data with different dimensions.

I.C.R.C. is one of the few organizations that offer Afghans cost-free and sustainable medical treatment for amputations and other injuries. It has been working in the country for 30 years and has provided more than 109,000 prosthetics to Afghans since the orthopedic program started. Many of the people who seek assistance were injured by roadside bombs, airstrikes or undetonated bomblets leftover from American cluster munitions dropped after the initial U.S.-backed invasion in 2001. In 2017, a third of the clinic’s patients were children, who are often taken on field trips to learn how to recognize and avoid stray ordnance. In a recent profile written by Mujib Mashal for The Times, Alberto Cairo, the head of I.C.R.C.’s physical rehabilitation program, described how these injuries are about more than physical loss. “When you lose a leg, you don’t just lose a leg — you lose a piece of heart, you lose a piece of mind, you lose a piece of self-confidence.”

Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary

The Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary was proclaimed by the Cameroonian government on April 3, 2008. It protects 19.44 km2 of land, and is located between the Mbulu and Nijikwa forests in western Cameroon. It consists of rugged, mountainous terrain and represents the highest altitudinal extent of the Cross River gorilla's distribution, with the highest point at  above sea level. Only about half of its land is a prime gorilla habitat, while the rest includes grassland or cultivation not suitable for the species. Due to its sanctuary status, it was expected to be provided with a conservator and eco-guards to enforce wildlife laws within its perimeters.

In Congress Omar with a record of anti-Semitism and U.S. rants has Pelosi support but incurred Reds’ wrath who want her to pay a higher cost. Want her to from Congress be expelled. Overturning the vote however misguided should be a hard sell. Omar is a total disgrace. Too many Somalis in her District to be replaced. It should matter not the party who the voters select. Only that in the primary or the general the voters in 2022 reject. Until then what is good for the goose should be good for the gander too. Like Green, House should remove any committee seats held by this anti-American Blue.. © June 13, 2021 The Alaskanpoet

A rare case of distal one-third of the transverse colon supplied by a branch from splenic artery.
We observed a rare variation of splenic artery during the routine dissection in the Laboratory of the Anatomy Department. It arose from the splenic artery toward the distal part of transverse colon which typically supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery. Embryologically distal part of the transverse colon is a segment of hindgut. In this case, splenic artery which an artery of foregut supplies an area of hindgut. The knowledge of splenic artery variations has significant importance during surgery of the organs of the upper abdominal region. In this study, we discussed clinical significance and embryological aspects of this anomalous artery.

ISI performance demonstration designed using the PISC know how. Abstract. International organisations concerned with standardisation and codification now tend to prefer the performance type of standard to the prescriptive types. The concept of performance demonstration has been supported by the PISC results and by the demonstration of the validity of validation assemblies. In this paper the general principles of PISC performance demonstration are discussed, with reference being made to the round robin tests and related parametric studies and actions..

An expected congressional proposal to overhaul and privatize the Federal Aviation Administration is drawing the concern of local pilots and airport management. They worry that the plan would result in increased fees that would make general aviation flying less accessible.

Congress is required to periodically reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. It did so in October, but that will only last until March 31.

When the next re-authorization bill is introduced — likely in February — it’s expected that the House of Representatives version will include provisions to privatize the FAA and make changes to how it is funded.

U.S. Rep. Collin Peterson said he expects to see a privatization effort brought up by in the House of Representatives next month.

“I’m not in favor of it, and the general aviation people — the ones I listen to — are skeptical of it as well,” Peterson said.

Peterson, a pilot himself, often uses his plane when traveling in 7th Congressional District in Minnesota.

“The concern is if they privatize they will charge us any time we fly,” Peterson said, speaking about the potential user fees that could come along with privatization.

The current system already ensures that both commercial and general aviation pays its fair share, according to the Alliance for Aviation Across America, a nonprofit coalition of organizations that support general aviation.

“We have always been against user fees,” said Devin Osting, deputy director of Alliance for Aviation across America.

The FAA is currently funded through a fuel tax, which Osting said is a fair way to distribute the cost.

Administering user fees would be a time-consuming process comparatively, he said.

“If you buy gas at an airport, you are complying with the law,” Osting said.

Those fees would be a problem for local pilots, according one airport manager.

“Having some user fees in there, like they do in Europe, would make it more cumbersome or expensive for people,” said Joe LaRue, manager of the Elbow Lake Pride of the Prairie Airport.

The airport, which hosts about 100 flights per month, focuses on general aviation with mostly hobbyists and weekend pilots, he said.

Privatizing the FAA would make it harder for rural communities, which rely more heavily on general aviation, to have a say on regulations, Osting said.

“The key mechanism that guarantees access for rural communities and smaller airports is the congressional component of it,” Osting said.

However, Peterson said it would be a unlikely, in his opinion, for the FAA to become privatized, she believes it isn’t as likely for that to be approved in the senate.

“I’d be surprised if the privatization survives in the process,” he said. “if it is in the bill, depending on how it is structured, I would vote against it,” Peterson said.

Another important aviation change being considered are revisions to medical certificates for pilots, Peterson said.

One problem older pilots are facing is many have lost medical certificates over technicalities, Peterson said.

Fixing this situation is something that has been requested by many of his constituents, Peterson said.

“We’ve been pushing on that for quite a while,” he said.

Local pilot Paul Brutlag described the current medical certification process as laborious and expensive for pilots.

Legislation passed by the U.S. Senate in December — The Pilot’s Bill of Rights 2 — includes a provision to change the medical requirements for most general aviation pilots. A similar bill has been introduced, but not voted on, in the House of Representatives.

Under the proposal, pilots would be considered healthy to fly as long as they possess a valid state driver’s license, comply with medical requirements for the driver’s license, are transporting less than six passengers and are operating under visual or instrument flight rules.

These changes would apply to aircraft with a maximum certified takeoff weight of 6,000 pounds or less.

Increased susceptibility to in vitro transformation of cells carrying the Eker tumor susceptibility mutation.
Rats carrying the Eker tumor susceptibility mutation are genetically predisposed to renal cell carcinoma. Rats heterozygous for the Eker mutation (Eker carriers) develop multiple bilateral renal cell carcinomas by the age of 1 year. Using an in vitro rat kidney epithelial (RKE) transformation assay developed in our laboratory, proximal tubule cells derived from known Eker rat carriers (+/ek) and non-carriers (+/+) were exposed to the carcinogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), to determine if cells derived from Eker carriers were more susceptible to in vitro transformation than cells derived from non-carrier animals. The percent transformation frequency following MNNG treatment was 7.5-fold higher in cells derived from carrier animals when compared to cells from non-carrier animals. This increased susceptibility to transformation due to inheritance of the Eker mutation is consistent with a predisposition resulting from inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. The increased susceptibility of kidney epithelial cells carrying the Eker mutation may prove useful in the further development of the RKE transformation assay as a sensitive tool to identify potential renal carcinogens. In addition, because transformation frequency in the RKE assay measures a very early step in multistage transformation, these results also suggest that alterations (by Loss of Heterozygosity or mutation) at the Eker tumor susceptibility locus are an early event in the development of renal tumors in the rat.

Ian Morris talked about his book, War! What Is It Good For?: Conflict and the Progress of Civilization From Primates to Robots, in which he argues that 15,000 years of war has advanced civilization. The author argued that throughout human history war created larger societies, which in turn created governments that diffused internal violence and enabled better conditions for economic gain. Mr. Morris also argued that although horrific, war has been a catalyst for greater personal safety. Ian Morris spoke at Harvard Book Store in Cambridge, Massachusetts. close

Reading mode: Light Dark. Shooting Raw or jpg. Started May 28, 2012 | Discussions thread. Shop cameras & lenses ▾. I have been shooting RAW. But it takes time to process RAW and then into jpg.. I recently purchased Lightroom 4 and have been using it. I found that LR4 was a fantastic pp-ing program. I now realized that there was no need to shoot RAW any more because LR4 could adjust jpg images very well except for correcting WB. I thought that it would be a good idea to shoot RAW for indoors pictures and jpg for other shootings..

OPM making changes to FEHBP - Is that good news?

Walt Francis, author of The Checkbook's Guide to Health Plans for Federal Employees

The Office of Personnel Management recently added 10 new plans for 2013 to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). They also sent a letter to insurers asking for expanded access to experimental drugs and wellness benefits. Plus, it wants to stop limits on essential benefits like maternity care. Walt Francis, principal author of the Checkbook's Guide to Health Plans for Federal Employees spoke with the Federal Drive with Tom Temin and Emily Kopp about what to expect.

"The things that are add-ons and improved benefits—I think [they] are going to have very small, negligible effects on premiums...Some of the reforms they're making, such as the emphasis on generic drugs, are likely to save significantly," Francis said. "There's always going to be premium increases, but there's no reason to think this program can't continue to beat the private sector generally."

Listen to the full interview above to hear more about the specific changes to FEHBP.

It is said, “Laughter is the best medicine”. Sometimes things just happen and you decide to laugh. Today was one such day and I had my portion of laughter medicine and thought it would be great to share some portion here with everyone.. My sister and I had gone shopping and were returning home.. I just asked her, “L***** do you want some chips?”. And she said, “No, I’m chewing gum.” It was the way she had intonated that made me laugh and I asked her quickly, “Since when have you become Chewing Gum.”. Then she corrected herself and said, “No, I mean I am chewing a gum.”. Advertisements

This Friday, over 500 members of Congress will get the chance to try the acclaimed Beyond Burger from Beyond Meat.

The fresh vegan burger, which is sold behind the meat counter at Whole Foods Market around the country, “bleeds” pulverized beet juice and has the look, smell, and taste of meat.

Hosted by the Congressional Vegetarian Staff Association, The Good Food Institute, and Beyond Meat, this event is sure to impress on countless decision makers the important role plant-based meats play in food security, animal protection, and environmental sustainability.

VegNews reports:

Several speakers—including GFI Executive Director Bruce Friedrich, Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown, and Congressional Vegetarian Staff Association President Adam Sarvana—will present the benefits of plant-based foods to the politicians in attendance.

With vegan foods becoming more accessible, it’s never been easier to ditch animal products. In fact, as meat consumption declines, delicious plant-based products are soaring. Vegan meats are expected to make up a third of the protein market by 2054.

You can join the growing number of people who are taking a stand for animals, the environment, and their own health by transitioning to a plant-based diet.

Immunomagnetic bone marrow purging in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) offers a therapeutic alternative for children with poor prognosis acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who lack an HLA-matched sibling donor. The most common cause of treatment failure after ABMT in these patients is leukemia relapse. We have developed an ex vivo autologous marrow purging program for children with ALL using an immunomagnetic method. BM purging has been performed in 37 children with ALL (31 B-lineage ALL and 6 T-lineage ALL) following an indirect method, using panels of mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against B or T cell antigens, Dynabeads M-450 (Dynal) coated with sheep antimouse (SAM) antibodies, and the MaxSep Magnetic Cell Separator (Baxter). Purging efficiency has been assessed by flow cytometry. Considering the limit of detection of target cells 0.1%, the median depletion was 2.0 log (range 0.8- > 2.8 log) for the B-lineage ALL and 2.7 (range 2.2- > 2, 9 log) for the T-lineage ALL patients. Twenty-seven patients have been autografted (6 in first complete remission, CR, 13 in second CR, and 8 in third or subsequent CR). Engraftment has been satisfactory in all of them, reaching levels of 500 neutrophils/mm3 and 20,000 platelets/mm3 after a median of 17 (range 12-39) and 30 (range 13-96) days post-ABMT, respectively. In summary, our results show that this immunomagnetic procedure achieves high levels of target cell depletion and can be safely applied to bone marrow purging in childhood ALL patients.

1 to 2 of 2. Hi,. Now we have the ability to track multiple pieces of gear it would be great if we could create different groups of gear. So you have a group of items, helmet/bike/shoe/tyre combo for training and a different group for racing /off road etc. This would be easier than having to tick all the different pieces each time you use them. You could create groups of gear for the common things you use together.. What do you think?. Cheers. Peter. PS: Great site. 1 to 2 of 2

We facilitated practical field training courses and an online course for developing professionals.

We conducted educational activities with school children.

We produced educational materials including mobile apps regarding biodiversity and conservation.

We created two educational booklets: one on land management in Peramagroon and surrounding area called "Peramagroon, profile of a Kurdish Mountain" and the second is a teacher's toolkit on environmental activities designed specifically for primary and secondary schools.

The outcomes of the project show that Piramagroon is suitable as a formal protected area, and provide pioneering examples of good practices of conservation.

Supporting Partners

The Darwin Project was a three year conservation program, funded by the Darwin Initiative of the United Kingdom's Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs. Focusing on the mountainous region of Kurdistan, specifically the mountain Piramagroon, the project is conducted by Nature Iraq and experts from the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) and BirdLife International (BirdLife).

The project has generated new data for conservation and resources for protected area management and environmental education. The team’s aim is to make significant progress in addressing the challenges of conservation resulting from nearly 30 years of scientific isolation. It helps address the vulnerability of biodiversity of Iraq due to limited capacity in dealing with threats to the environment breakdowns in traditional land management caused by years of instability followed by rapid recent development. The Darwin Project has served as a model for conservation that can be applied elsewhere in Iraq.

The Piramagroon area, a mountain massif in the Kurdistan Region, has been selected because it meets Key Biodiversity Areas criteria and is readily accessible.

One major focus of the Darwin work was the land management surveys conducted in nine villages, which collected qualitative and quantitative information regarding land management practices, using observation and group interviews with locals as tools. The team has also conducted several educational outreach activities focused on local communities, mainly children in schools.

An online course on Biodiversity and Conservation, the first of its kind in Iraq, was launched in cooperation with the University of Sulaimani's Faculty of Agriculture to help future conservation leaders develop technical skills necessary for effective assessment and management.

One legacy of the project is interactive identification guides to the biological diversity of Piramagroon, including photographic guides which can be downloaded to mobile phones. This technology has been recognized as a particularly appropriate, accessible and user-friendly way to disseminate information in the Middle East. This will be the first time it has been utilized for biodiversity information in Iraq.

Craigavon (Portadown, Lurgan and the shopping centre bit with the roundabouts in the middle) was created in 1965 as part of a grand plan to establish and to demonstate that the North ” was in some ways a symbol of Northern Ireland as both modern and a part of British mainstream” according to wikipedia. Of course the real reason it was built was to establish a more or less permanent unionist majority in North Armagh.. We now know that, like Belfast, unionism is in a minority here (48.4% from 52.9% in 2001) and Nationalism is getting closer. (46% fron 44.7%).. The most dramatic swings have taken place in Annagh, Church, Edenderry, Kernan Tavanagh and Parklake. The overall trend is a cumulative 8.1% in favour of catholics.

Integrity First, Living The Honor Code In Business

By Waldo Waldman

Integrity First. It’s core value #1 of the U.S. Air Force… embraced by our leadership, taught in our training programs, and a symbol of the commitment and character of the men and women serving our country.

I learned a valuable lesson about the true meaning of integrity after only serving several years in the Air Force. It wasn’t on a combat mission flying an F-16. It was during a training sortie I flew as a brand new instructor pilot, and I learned it flying solo.

It was a rare occasion for an instructor pilot to get to fly solo, but this was my lucky day and I was going to make the most of it. I had finished my maneuvers in the military operating area (MOA) and was performing my last touch and go’s in the pattern before landing. Feeling really fired up, I pushed the throttles to full power, gained airspeed, and decided to see how many G’s I could “pull” in the pattern. The structural G-limit on the rugged and reliable Cessna T-37B twin engine jet trainer was 6.67 g’s, and I was about to see how close I could come to hitting the limit. You see, I was doing what we call in the Air Force, ‘hot doggin’ it. In other words, I was asking for trouble.

I accelerated to 225 knots, banked it into 90 degrees, and pulled. 5.7G’s…One more time…6.4g’s…again…6.8 g’s!!! I looked down and did a double take. “Wow,” I though to myself, “I just over-g’d the jet!” My first instinct was to reach over and punch off the G-meter (zero out the meter sort of like setting an odometer back to zero). After all, I had seen other, more experienced pilots do it before and besides, the T-37 was tough as nails. What was .127 G’s going to do to the jet?

I was faced with a difficult choice, zero out the G-meter and act like nothing had happened. Or immediately land this damaged jet, admit my mistake, and accept the consequences. I cringed as I pondered what my fellow wingmen would think of me. And then I thought to myself…what if my twin brother was to fly that jet tomorrow and the wing fell off? My choice became instantly clear.

My commander wasn’t pleased, to say the least. My actions were irresponsible and showed a lack of discipline. Not only was I severely reprimanded, I was grounded from flying for 2 weeks and had to present a briefing to the squadron on the maintenance procedure to inspect the jet for structural damage. The cost of this inspection was $25K of our taxpayer’s hard earned money and the plane (a critical training resource for our squadron) would also be grounded for 2 weeks. Fortunately, the inspection revealed no damage to the aircraft. Nonetheless, I had cost my fellow wingmen valuable training.

Have you ever been in a situation where your integrity was tested? Have you ever been given a choice where admitting (or not admitting) a mistake would effect your reputation, the safety of others, and even your career?

There are several lessons that can be drawn from my experience.

* Your integrity (or lack thereof) affects everyone – For me, failure to turn myself in and admit my mistake could have caused a major accident, or a potential loss of life. For you, it can be a safety accident, a lost customer and also a lost life. Your actions have to reach outside of your cockpit.

* Integrity should not be a choice – it should be instinctual and we should always strive to do the right thing, no matter what the cost. And it doesn’t start and end at work. Integrity should be honored 24 hours a day…your wingmen are watching you.

* Rank has its responsibilities, as well as its privileges – As an officer in the Air Force, I had (and still have) a responsibility to comply with the flying regulations and standards of my squadron. It’s called being a professional. As an employee with your company, you too must be responsible to comply with its regulations and standards of behavior.

When leading your wingmen on the factory floor, at a hospital, or in the office, you can’t afford to breach your integrity, and you also can’t make exceptions for others. The costs are too high and can be measured in injuries, worker compensation claims, lost man hours, and your reputation. OSHA regulations, safety/patient care procedures, and operating instructions exist for a reason…they keep people safe, prevent accidents, and help save money for your company by reducing operating costs.

Will you make mistakes on the job? Of course. Will you also bear witness to others making mistakes? Absolutely. But, will you have the courage to confront them and hold them accountable, or will you be more concerned with being ‘a nice guy’ who doesn’t ruffle feathers? Sometimes the toughest job of a Top Gun Leader is disciplining your employees when they mess up. Will you stand up and take action? If you don’t, then who will?

The way you can help create an environment where your wingmen will live and work with integrity and admit their mistakes is when you honor your integrity and have the courage to admit your mistakes. This is the foundation of creating a culture of courage. Integrity is contagious and it has to start from the top down. Moreover, when you shift the focus off of yourself and instead focus on your mission and how your actions affect your co-workers and customers, you become a more trusting wingman.

Courage builds character. It’s the foundation of integrity. It gives you the thrust to make the correct choice and do what is right despite the consequences. What’s more, you be able to sleep better at night.

Q:

What topology makes $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^1$

The circle $\mathbb{S}^1$ is homeomorphic to  $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}:=\{x+\mathbb{Z}\ |\ x\in [0; 1)\}$, but this answer states the topology is not the subspace topology. I wonder if it's the topology generated by half-open intervals $[a, b)$?
Also, what does the topology of $\mathbb{S}^1$ "look like", without embedding $\mathbb{S}^1$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{C}$, but intrinsically? Is it made up of open intervals? Can we even think of open intervals in $\mathbb{S}^1$ without resorting to an "ambient space"?

A:

First, it is important to note that $S^1$ is not a subspace on $\mathbb{R}$, and so, the subspace topology is irrelevant here. Rather, it is a quotient of $\mathbb{R}$.
As to what the topology looks like: locally, $S^1$ looks exactly like $\mathbb{R}$. This means that small intervals in the circle are homeomorphic to real intervals. The difference between the line and the circle is a global one. That is, it cannot be seen by small creatures living on a circle. (This is somewhat similar to the difference between $S^2$ and the plane. Recall that it took people many years before they realized we were all living on a sphere).
Edit: In the answer mentioned in the post, the circle is identified with the interval $[0,1)$. While this identification may help to understand $S^1$ as a set or as a group (in the same way one can identify the ring $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ with the set $\{0,\ldots,m-1\}$), I find it very confusing in the topological aspect. If I had to describe the topology of the circle by means of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, I would take the closed interval $[0,1]$ and glue both its endpoints to one another.



People are often too preoccupied with their physical health to acknowledge the issues that might appear in the mental health department. While it might still take a while until mental health awareness reaches the level desired, more individuals have started to direct their attention to what today’s society is dealing with in this area. Anxiety and depression are two of the most frequently met conditions, with millions of sufferers around the globe, either professionally diagnosed or undiagnosed. Chronic anxiety cases have increased in number, especially among teens, and the effects of this issue are known to trigger a lowering in one’s general quality of life. If you are one of the many anxiety sufferers, you may have been tempted to rely on medications to reduce the symptoms and manage living a normal life. However, you should know that there are other more appealing and effective techniques you should consider trying first and not have your well-being depend on pharmaceutics.

Let it out and embrace your current self

Acceptance is the first step that needs to be taken in this situation. Instead of hiding your symptoms, not talking about your anxiety experience with your loved ones, and acting like this isn’t an issue in your life, let it all out and embrace your current self. Keeping your feelings, emotions and inner struggles bottled up will only make things worse and prevent you from actually accessing a solution and fighting against the problem in an effective way. Don’t be afraid to share your experiences with others, to express your feelings regardless of how difficult it may initially seem, and to start releasing your emotions in controlled environments and in healthy ways.

Value personal time – consider engaging in a retreat program

Self-care is recommended for any individual but when you are suffering from a mental health disorder and are experiencing perhaps more difficulties in carrying out regular, daily tasks, this becomes even more relevant. Allocating some time to yourself and your wellness is advised and the best way to do that is by detaching yourself from your regular habits, and engaging in a proper retreat program. Spending some time away from technology and everything that is causing you stress, in an environment that fosters tranquility can have an amazing impact on you. Consider the possibility of seeking a facilitate that promotes mental health through various natural treatments and spend a few days, or even a few weeks there. Retreats that focus on helping individuals get their mental health back on track will teach you various techniques on how to deal with anxiety crises and how to boost your wellness in general. At the right retreat, you will also learn how to avoid drugs and pharmaceutics temptation when you are dealing with an unpleasant anxiety attack episodes. https://www.theholisticsanctuary.com presents actual examples of success stories on how overcoming disorders of this kind is in fact possible. Repeat this personal healing journey a couple of times, and the outcomes might just surprise you.

Develop healthier lifestyle habits

Because your physical and mental wellbeing are linked together, it’s highly important to make sure you are keeping your lifestyle in-check. Start developing habits that nurture a healthy way of life, and once your body is in a better state, your mind will follow as well. Prioritize exercising, workouts having a calming effect, watch out what you eat, try to stay away from coffee, which will only make you more agitated, and try to have a proper sleep schedule. All of these things will help you feel better, and when you are feeling better, coping with anxiety will become easier.

Understand the importance of therapy

While talking with your friends and family about what you are going through is a good thing, you often need the advice of a professional on how to deal with certain events in your life that are triggering your anxiety. The environment a therapist provides as well as their approach on mental health will help you develop healthier and more effective mechanisms of keeping your mental health on track. Therapy can do wonders, so it’s worth your consideration.

Stay away from alcohol and recreational drugs

Illegal substance abuse and alcoholism cases are often linked o mental health problems, especially to anxiety and depression. When you are dealing with the unpleasant symptoms that anxiety is known to trigger, considering their effect on your state of mind and happiness, you may be tempted to seek momentary relief. Teens are most of all exposed to this sort of temptation due to their friend circles and the locations they frequent. While it might seem like a good way to numb your anxiety, alcohol and drug consumption, as seldom as it may be, will only worsen your state and cause you further health problems, both mentally and physically. It may only take you a couple of times of experimenting with drugs to develop an actual addiction. As you probably know by now, addiction will affect your health and your relationship with friends and family, causing a lot of harm and leading to an even lower quality of life. Never rely on alcohol or drugs to escape anxiety – the “feel-good” sensation ensured is only a temporary illusion.

Anxiety has become an epidemic over the last couple of years, with more teens being diagnosed with this mental health issue, surpassing the rates of depression cases. While awareness has been increased on the topic, and mental health is currently a “hot” topic of discussion, few are the ones who are actually combating the problem in a proper way. Pharmaceutics and drugs, and often illegal substances have become the go-to solution for people suffering from chronic anxiety, the majority not realizing the negative impact these can actually have. Now that you know a bit more on the subject, you should consider adopting the right coping mechanism and relying on natural treatments rather than medications that aren’t fixing the issue, but only causing more harm. Take into account these suggestions, and you’ll soon experience an improvement.

Determining the successful operation of various hardware associated with the engine typically requires several sensors for determining the states of the various types of hardware. Providing separate sensors for each of the different parts of the engine increases the overall cost of the engine and, therefore, increases the cost of the vehicle. Automobile manufacturers are under increased pressure to reduce costs while providing a reliable vehicle.
One sensor that may be used within a vehicle is an in-cylinder pressure sensor. The in-cylinder pressure sensor provides feedback for operating the engine. The in-pressure sensor signal may have a significant amount of noise. Low-pass filtering with a band pass filter may attenuate the signal to unacceptable levels so that sufficient pressure data may not be obtained.

Probing metal-complexes with metallothioneins by reversed phase microbore chromatography and capillary zone electrophoresis coupled with inductively coupled plasma and electrospray mass spectrometry.
Four different hyphenated techniques: microbore reversed phase (RP) HPLC-ICP MS, CZE-ICP MS, RP HPLC-ES MS and CZE-ES MS were investigated for the characterization of metallothionein-metal complexes under neutral pH conditions. Particular attention was given to the differentiation between metallothionein and artifact signals, identification of mixed-metal complexes, and the validity of the molecular mass as the identification parameter of the different MT iso- and sub-isoforms. Despite the similar morphology of chromatograms and electrophoregrams mass spectrometry revealed different origin of the apparently corresponding peaks. The performance of the four above mentioned techniques was characterized using the example of rabbit liver MT-1 preparation. Reversed-phase HPLC with post-column acidification prior to ES MS was judged to be the most versatile technique for the characterization of metal complexes with metallothioneins but other techniques offer valuable auxiliary information.

Step 7. Reference Points. Determining reference points for MPA density ratio, total catch from the previous season, and fishing mortality will depend on previous trends in existing data and fishery independent finfish survey data, as well as best practices from the literature. These data should be analyzed and the results discussed by a relevant group of stakeholders and scientists in order to determine the best target and limit reference points. Stakeholders in our case study decided to use a three year running average for both the MPA density ratio and Total catch reference points to incorporate natural stochasticity in fish populations – before making management decisions..

First, the US is now the dominant country in the world. It no longer has to worry about a Cold War with the Soviet Union. Now, it is the only superpower and has more of a role to play in every part of the world (where once the Soviets "took care" of some areas).

Second, the US has to worry about more kinds of threats. Instead of just thinking about the Soviets, it now has to worry about "little" threats from more places. It has to worry about Al Qaeda and it has to worry about pirates in Somalia. It has to worry about conflict between China and its neighbors. Worrying about many small issues is a different challenge than worrying about one major issue.

Whilst it was a little muddy, the naked trainers made the most of the unusually warm weather at the end of 2015. We had some really great sessions in December that focussed on human interaction and team work. We used bodyweight partner drills to provide resistance to each other and teamed up against other naked trainers to get an amount of reps, exercises and tasks done as a team. Balancing on one of the large logs in Bushy Park whilst your partner ran out to complete their reps was harder than we first thought. Piggy backs and wheel barrow races in muddy conditions also proved tough.. The beauty of these type of sessions is that we used the elements, our surroundings and each other to work hard and still have fun in a group and team environment.. More of this will come in 2016 and we hope to mix individual goals and achievements with those we reach as a team.

The Wonder of Colour - Slugs, Gems, Buttons, Beads and Feathers

A friend emailed me photos by a brilliant underwater photographer, David Boubilet www.daviddoubilet.comand I just have to share with you this fascinating photo of what I imagine are sea slugs. Aren't the colours just mind boggling? I adore them and they are such an appealing pair!

While writing about colour I have to introduce a wonderfully talented friend who lives with her husband in a lovely house, built by him - a glorious unspoilt rainforest hideaway behind the Sunshine Coast. She is Renee Blackwell of Renee Blackwell Design (www.reneeblackwelldesign.com) and in the peaceful surroundings of her bush studio, she creates exciting and unique jewellery using gemstones, ethnic beads and buttons which she seeks out from all around the world. Her designs are so striking and many of the colours combined are beautifully subtle, so that they can grace any attire. Be sure to look at her website and her blog.

Rings created from vintage German and French Metal Buttons (Brass and Pewter) set in sterling silver.

Top:Dark Smokey Topaz
Middle:Picture Jasper
Bottom:Fossilised Dinosaur bone (found in the Australian outback!) cut and polished and set in sterling silver.

Of course I must mention the breathtaking colours I find in feathers which I employ for my Images de Plumes. They never cease to make me wonder at nature. Here is a collection of just a few in a picture I sold in Tasmania recently.

About Me

My previous passion was Classical Decoupage which I created, wrote about and taught for many years. However, after breaking my arm badly I had to give it up.
One morning while lying in bed wondering how I could fulfill my creative urges, I thought of my long term interest in silhouettes and suddenly the inspiration came to me that I could dress them in feathers. I started with 18th century silhouettes but have now developed this art form further and have never looked back. In so doing I have been made even more aware of the breathtaking beauty of birds and the intricacy of their feathers, so a whole new world has opened up to me.

New York, February 12, 2008 --Imagine getting straight A's in kindergarten -- then struggling the rest of your school life to get a passing grade. That's what Michael Jackson's life has been like since releasing "Thriller" 25 years ago. And since he has been unable to duplicate the smash success of that project, he's dropping a new version of the old album today. It's a version of Thriller that features new collaborations with people like Fergie, will.i.am and Kanye West. Jackson is out with a new video to promote the album. The clip, released through his record label, says his passion for music is still strong -- and that he expects to do more music in the future.

In today's society, computer systems are commonplace. Computer systems may be found in the workplace, at home, or at school. Computer systems may include data storage systems, or disk storage systems, to process and store data. Data storage systems, or disk storage systems, are utilized to process and store data. A storage system may include one or more disk drives. These data processing systems typically require a large amount of data storage. Customer data, or data generated by users within the data processing system, occupies a great portion of this data storage. Many of these computer systems include virtual storage components. Data compression is widely used to reduce the amount of data required to process, transmit, or store a given quantity of information. Data compression is the coding of data to minimize its representation. Compression can be used, for example, to reduce the storage requirements for files, to increase the communication rate over a channel, or to reduce redundancy prior to encryption for greater security. However, data compression consumes a significant amount of computing (e.g. central processing unit “CPU”) resources. Also, data can be lost due to problems such as system crashes, hardware failures, and abnormal computing system halts. Journaled file systems can be used to maintain data integrity when these types of problems occur.

Ptrace is a system call provided in unix for one process to take control of another process to debug errors or bugs in the system. The process under control can be run step by step and its memory can be read and modified.. int sys_ptrace(long request, long pid, long addr, long data);. the function processes various request defined in the parameter request and pid indicates the process id of the process to be controlled.. Using the request PTRACE_TRACEME, a process can specify that its parent process controls iut via ptrace().

Geometric specification of dynamics: learning to visually perceive kinetic quantities from static images.
In a single experiment, perceivers viewed computer-generated hammer-like objects and estimated a kinetic property. Each hammer comprised a cylinder of some diameter and height, attached to a handle-a second cylinder of fixed diameter and variable length. On 5 blocks of trials, three groups of perceivers reported a property reflecting mass, torque, or moment of inertia. Blocks 2-4 were training blocks on which numerical feedback was given. On blocks 6 and 7, perceivers were asked to report the kinetic properties not reported on blocks 1-5. We were interested in how geometrical object properties affected the perception of kinetic properties, and how that perception changed with experience. To determine how geometrical object properties informed reports of kinetics, a continuous information space of head diameter and height, and handle length was created, and perceivers' loci within that space were determined. Perceivers began at various distances from the optimum for the to-be-reported property and were closer to the optimum after training. On blocks 6 and 7, performance did not reflect transfer from training on another property. The results were interpreted in the context of the theory of direct learning.

Hooray! Philly Is Finally Getting Its Long-Delayed Board Game Cafe

Owner Matt Hendricks swears that Thirsty Dice will probably, almost certainly, hopefully open on October 19th.

Get a compelling long read and must-have lifestyle tips in your inbox every Sunday morning — great with coffee!

I don’t know about you, but I love board games. Not virtual board games that you play on your iPad. Hate those. I’m talking about actual, physical board games that you take out of a box and stick on a table. So when, back in January, I heard that Philadelphia was getting a board game bar and cafe called Thirsty Dice and that it would be opening in the spring — meaning months ago — I was super psyched. But here it is officially fall, and I’m still waiting for Thirsty Dice to open.

“All of the stories that you hear about the difficulty of getting a liquor license in Philadelphia — that stuff is certainly true,” says Thirsty Dice owner and La Salle grad Matt Hendricks in explaining one of the many reasons for the many delays. But Hendricks says that he’s almost ready to open Thirsty Dice, and he’s set October 19th as the opening date.

Once Thirsty Dice opens in this building at 1642 Fairmount Avenue, the 2,700 square foot space will house 800 board games, plenty of tables to play them on, and a bar and cafe setup.

“Every year, about 3,000 games come out,” says Hendricks. “I think the value we bring is in finding the best ones and curating a great library of games. Cards Against Humanity is one kind of fun, Battleship is another kind of fun, and Catan and Reef are another kind of fun, and we’ll cater to all of those tastes.”

Hendricks tells Philly Mag that he got the idea for Thirsty Dice about seven years ago, when he and his wife were in Toronto and popped into Snakes and Lattes, a board game cafe. They expected to just grab a cup of coffee but then wound up staying for hours.

At Thirsty Dice, customers will pay $7 each to access the board game library for as long as they want. If you don’t have a clue what you want to play, the staff will make suggestions, explain the rules to you once you’ve made a selection, and they’ll even referee when there’s a dispute. Who says I can’t use an abbreviation in Scrabble?!

Though Thirsty Dice will have a bar, Hendricks says that it’s going to be a family friendly environment and that he expects more of a family vibe during the day, especially on weekends, and maybe more of an adult, Cards Against Humanity, Manhattan-drinking vibe in the evenings.

Of course, all of that’s once Thirsty Dice actually, you know, opens, and we’ve been hearing about this for a long time. I congratulated Hendricks on finally getting a real opening date on the calendar and told him I’d see him there that day.

“Well, fingers crossed,” Hendricks replied. “It’s like pitching a no-hitter. There’s no congrats before it actually happens.”

Student Probability Seminar. The Mixing Time of Glauber Dynamics on the Critical 2D Ising Model. Speaker: Reza Gheissari. Location: Warren Weaver Hall 1314. Date: Thursday, March 3, 2016, 4 p.m.. Synopsis:. Consider the Glauber dynamics with stationary distribution given by the Ising measure on \(\mathbb Z^2\). The mixing time of the Markov chain (the time it takes to approach stationarity in \(L_1\)) is intimately related to the gap in the spectrum of its generator. We begin with some basic facts about the mixing time and spectral gap, then prove the block dynamics technique introduced by Martinelli, to recursively bound the spectral gap of a chain on a spin system. The rest of the talk will then provide a nice application of the technique to obtain a polynomial upper bound on the mixing time of the Ising model in 2D at its critical temperature (Lubetzky, Sly). If time permits we will discuss some related problems where the block dynamics could prove useful.

Hi all, so I've suffered on and off with neck pain for a while now along with a very stiff neck which hurts to turn both ways. At the base of my neck the bones are tender when you apply pressure and occasionally when I move my neck it almost feels like something has popped or moved? Sometimes my neck will be fine however sometimes after Sleeping or after exercise it will start hurting again!. My main concern is ocassionally this pain gets quite bad and almost feels like a burning/gnawing pain which runs from my neck right up the back of my skull, the top of my head will be tender to touch, intense headaches which will also appear behind my eyes/sinuses (I suffer with chronic sinusitis also). Sometimes it'll even run down my left arm accompanied by some pins and needles, any ideas on what this could be?. It's terribly painful and makes me feel out of sorts with a foggy head. I do suffer with health anxiety so obviously I then feel worse because I panic, any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!

BJJ Ladies

The Comp 450 is one of our favorite, tried-and-true, gis. Since the beginning, we've focused on making it the competition gi of choice for all jiu jitsu athletes. Every version has been better than the last. Our latest one, the Comp 450 V5, is the best yet! Featuring the same ultra-durable mid-weight 450 GSM Pearl Weave jacket and 100% 10 oz drill cotton, we gave the Comp 450 V5 an edgier look, so you can look like sharp while sharpening your skills and reigning supreme both your home mat and the tournament setting!

The new Tatami Fightwear Nova BJJ Gi has been designed for beginner students and experts alike. Several enhancements have been made to the new Nova BJJ Gi to make is better than its predecessor in several areas. The Nova is a better fitting Gi and tapered in all the key areas. The Nova now features a 450gsm Hybrid weave jacket with heavy cotton reinforcements in all areas. The pants have been upgraded to a 9oz poly cotton blend making them heavier and more resilient than the older 8oz twill cotton.

Whether you’re a competitor worried about the scale, or just looking for lightweight kimono that’s comfortable and isn’t flimsy, the Kingz Nanō kimono was built to impress. Designed with the competitor in mind, the Kingz Nanō kimono is an ultra-light-weight kimono that delivers the same remarkable level of comfort, quality, and strength that Kingz is known for, at a fraction of the weight.

The Estilo is Tatami's longest running BJJ Kimono, spanning over 6 years of constant development and improvement. The Estilo 6.0 is the crowning jewel in the Tatami collection, and is what we believe one of the highest quality, visually appealing and well priced BJJ Gi's on the market. Working with our team of high level athletes such as 2017 ADCC Champion JT Torres and Jiu Jitsu icons such as Vitor 'Shaolin' Ribeiro and Robson Moura we believe the Estilo 6.0 to be outstanding in every aspect.

High quality embroideries adorn the shoulders of Gi and the outside leg area of the pants. The Estilo logo is subtly placed at the back of the neck and the bottom of the right shin area of the pants. A small embroidery is placed on the front of the jacket with the text “Estilo VI”. A sublimated neck yoke lining and side vent lining adds a high quality detail to the new Estilo 6.0, with new unique woven taping to line the inside of the sleeve cuffs, ankle cuffs and the bottom of the jackets. The new Estilo 6.0 jacket continues to feature the unique Y shaped jacket vent. The Y vent we feel helps to provide a better fit along the base of the jacket.

The Estilo 6.0 also has some subtly placed detail areas that have not been seen before on the previous generations of the Estilo.

Tatami Fightwear are proud to introduce their New Nova range of Basic BJJ GI. With minimal styling and no patches these BJJ GI are ideal for beginners and experts alike. If you like your BJJ GI plain and simple you won’t beat the Tatami Fightwear Nova BJJ GI range for style and value.

As a competitor, you want – and need – a gi that will perform. We agree. That is why we developed the top-quality Kingz 450 Comp Women’s gi, now in its fourth edition. Our latest (and greatest) version, it features that same level of premium quality and exceptional durability that we delivered with the V3, but with new embroidered detailing that will keep you looking sharp and killing it, whether at your home academy or on the tournament mats.

This gi was designed for the athlete who trains often, understands there are no easy days on the mat, but also wants to look absolutely smashing while… well… smashing, or passing, her opponents.

With its sleek design and exceptional construction, the Kingz Basic kimono is an excellent choice for practitioners looking for a gi that will withstand the rigors of the mat like top-priced kimonos, but without breaking the bank. NOW in a women's cut, with a beautiful purple colorway.

The Kingz Basic kimono delivers a remarkable level of comfort and quality, and is excellent for day-to-day training at any experience level.

Complexity is the great challenge of 21st century biological research and pharmaceutical discovery. One approach to this challenge is the new field of computational cell biology, which has emerged at the confluence of cell biology, chemical kinetics, and computer science. Its potential lies in the development of new software tools that facilitate cell biological investigations even as the systems being studied grow increasingly complex. This Phase I SBIR proposal meshes database technology and kinetic modeling to construct one such tool. It aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a software platform that integrates database technology with modeling software. This platform will support the testing of multiple large-scale hypotheses against multiple experimental data sets. The first aim is to complete a prototype software application, called ProcessDB, with a robust set of features supporting efficient formulation, quantification, comparison, and testing of large models. ProcessDB is built on a database of cell and molecular biology primitives such as molecules, complexes, cellular locations, states, and processes, and will permit cell biologists to translate and export their diagrams, working hypotheses and experimental protocols to third-party modeling and optimization software for simulation and parameter estimation. The second aim of this project is feasibility testing. A panel of three expert cell and molecular biologists will exercise our software application by using it to build and test multiple working models of their biological systems. Feasibility will be demonstrated if the prototype software 1) has the stated features, 2) is available via the Internet, and 3) allows cell biologists to enter their theories easily and test them quantitatively against their own dynamic experimental data. No existing software package uses a database of molecules, complexes, places, and processes to manage the formulation and testing of multiple large-scale mechanistic models. The benefit to our users is a faster path to mechanistic understanding of complex cell biological pathways.

By Steven Reinberg. HealthDay Reporter... The American Cancer Society recommends that men "make an informed decision with their health care provider about whether to be screened for prostate cancer." The decision should be made "after getting information about the uncertainties, risks and potential benefits of prostate cancer screening." The discussion about screening should take place at:. - Age 50 for men at average risk of prostate cancer who are expected to live at least 10 more years.. - Age 45 for men at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This includes blacks and men who have a first-degree relative (father, brother or son) diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than 65).. - Age 40 for men at even higher risk (those with more than one first-degree relative who had prostate cancer at an early age).. After these discussions, men who still want to be screened should get the PSA blood test. The digital rectal exam may also be used as a part of the screening, the cancer society says.

Duke goes from Green to Golden. We were called upon to do a color change on a 7′ Duke Pool Table in Anaheim Hills, California. We delivered and set this pool table up two years ago with Standard Green Cloth. The green cloth was not completely worn out, but the family decided to switch to a more neutral color to compliment their game room decor.. Golden is a great color that goes great with nearly all types of wood stains. It is similar to Camel, but has a brighter tone. It looks great in the natural sunlight and becomes deeper and richer under the billiard lamp.. This pool table refelt took a little extra time because the existing feather strips were not able to be re-used. Feather strips are pieces of wood or sometimes rubber, used to attach cloth to the top of the rail. Using a planer, new ones were perfectly fitted and will last for years to come.. Our pool table cloth color chart is available to view online, but we suggest a visit to our showroom to see felt samples in person.

Astroglia proliferate in response to oxytocin and vasopressin.
The effects of the peptides oxytocin and vasopressin on the proliferation of cultured cortical and hypothalamic astroglia were assessed by two corroborative methods. Both hemocytometer cell counts, and immunocytochemistry for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression indicate that oxytocin increases the rate of proliferation of both cortical and hypothalamic astroglia. While vasopressin also had an effect on cortical cells, no conclusive evidence for vasopressin affecting proliferation of hypothalamic astroglia was found.

You had no formal role in the making of the TV show, but were you tapped for your insights?

We had a lot of discussions about when can you sacrifice accuracy and when not. We agreed you can sacrifice accuracy as long as it doesn’t impact the narrative. And so we could not get real shtreimels [a fur hat worn by many Satmar men] because the real ones are made of mink; they’re expensive, shops wouldn’t have sold it to us, and we just didn’t have the budget. I was constantly in touch with the costume designer to make fake ones that look real.

Making them look real was really hard, and at some point we thought, they’re never going to look 100 percent like the real thing. But the only people who are going to know that are going to be Hasidic Jews. And guess what? It doesn’t change the story if the shtreimels are fake.

What were you homing in on while watching the TV adaptation?

I was concerned about the dignity of Esty, which is also one of the things I was concerned about when writing “Unorthodox”; how do you write about the things that are most shameful and painful in a way that retains dignity? I was worried how Shira would manage to juggle the experience of humiliation and the kind of shattering of all hope while still maintaining some sense of dignity as a woman and human being. I was so scared for her the whole time as I watched the episodes. I felt really anxious because I knew that if she failed, then it would be like I had failed, like I would not have dignity anymore in my story. It’s scary to give someone your story for the screen because you can’t control it. On the other hand, I knew I didn’t want a part in controlling it.

In Episode 4, during the Passover scene, the grandfather leads the prayers and tells the story of Exodus. No women participate. Yet, if you look at the actions that move “Unorthodox” forward, almost all are taken by the female characters.

Men tell the story and women make the story real. Women make the story happen. You have the table where the man dictates prayer, belief and narrative, but if you look at the story of Esty, it’s women who are making the decisions. It’s the women she’s interacting with, who are basically the driving force behind community life, the engine behind the story. If you watch the series with this in mind, you realize that the men are actually kind of passive figures carried along by the story. They play the roles in how it’s been told, but it’s the women who make the story go on.

Most conventional DC power supply circuits reduce voltage by using transformers. The power supply circuit of the invention, in contrast, uses a capacitor as the voltage reducing component and a bridge type current rectifier device for converting AC current to DC current resulting in a power supply having a smaller volume, lower weight, and lower cost.
While high frequency carrier wave controlled switching type power supply circuits have a similar volume and weight, capacitor abased circuits have less heat loss and lower cost than such switching type power supplies, and in addition eliminate noise interference (EMC). Therefore, application of this type of power supply has gradually expanded from low power applications to medium and large power applications.
Because the effect of using a capacitor as a voltage reducing component is essentially the same as using the conventional series-combined resistors, i.e., the output terminal voltage is inversely related to the output current, control of the capacitor-based power supply circuit is as follows: when the output current is increased, the output terminal voltage is reduced, while when the output current is decreased, the output terminal voltage will be raised. In addition, the capacitor regulated circuit can be further installed with a controllable current distributing circuit device parallel connected with the output terminals of the current rectifier device to actively control the output voltage.
It is thus an objective of the invention to provide an improved voltage and current power supply circuit made up of a voltage reducing and current limiting rectifying circuit formed by capacitors and a bridge type current rectifier device. The output terminals of the rectifying circuit are parallel connected to a current distributing circuit device which controls the output voltage.

Membrane Bioreactors (MBR) are a very attractive option for the treatment of hospital wastewater and elimination of pharmaceuticals in high density urban areas. The present investigation showed that, depending on the substance, between 19% and 94% of the level of antibiotics found in the environment originate from hospitals. Because of their ecotoxic potential, hospital wastewaters can have a significant impact on the environment. The segregation of these wastewaters and their separate treatment at the source can reduce the entry of drugs in waterways and enable water reuse after adequate polishing treatment processes..

Do you know how to enable the in-game damage parser? The game has a built-in function for summarizing damage over a set period. It is very helpful and works on PS. Paralyzing Dart is AoE. I can try out Zip Tie Attack later on PCTest and see how it compares against the Flight version. The Boo Belt + 4 Boos does amazing AoE damage. For your utility belt, drop the Backup. Backup does horrible damage compared to what you would be getting from LexCorp Automated Sidekick or really any other pet trinket. Try summoning both of them one a a time. Compare the damage output. It is a night and day difference. Pet trinkets in this game do not all do the same damage. Some are much better than others.

About. What started off as a need to make videos for my business turned into a passion for capturing life’s overlooked moments.. I bought a Canon 60d and the 50mm f1.8 lens and took my first picture with the widest aperture. When I saw that bokeh effect, I was hooked. I took my camera with me to the Italian Market in Philly to see what other types of pictures I could get.

The Southern tradition of eating black-eyed peas and collard greens in the New Year is a delicious one, though not remotely quick enough for a weeknight. Until now, that is... How to Make It. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Sprinkle pork with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add pork to pan; cook, turning to brown all sides, until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 145°F, about 15 minutes. Place pork on a cutting board; let stand 10 minutes. Cut into 12 slices.. Melt remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in skillet over medium. Add onion, bell pepper, garlic, and thyme; sauté 3 minutes. Move onion mixture to one side of pan; add collard greens to other side of pan. Cook 2 minutes. Add black-eyed peas and vinegar to greens; cook 1 minute. Stir together onion mixture and collard mixture. Stir in remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Serve with sliced pork.

The cost of manufacturing an integrated electronic circuit comprising such an integrated inductor is strongly associated with the level of integration of the electronic elements forming it. In some applications, it is necessary to have available several inductance values in one and the same integrated circuit. Different inductors are then produced on the surface of the substrate, each one having a respective inductance.
A need exists in the art to increase the level of integration of the integrated circuit, and therefore to allow the manufacturing costs of such a circuit to be reduced in this type of application.

Ancient Britons 'drank from skulls'. Ancient.. .". NHM colleague Professor Chris Stringer helped excavate one of the skull-cups in 1987 and is a co-author on the paper.. "We've known that these bones were treated in this way for 20 years; it's been evident that there were cut marks on the skulls," he told BBC News.. "But by applying the latest microscopic techniques and the experience we've got in working on butchered animal remains, as well as human remains, we can start to build up a much more detailed picture of how the Gough's Cave remains were treated. Yes, cannibalism is the most likely explanation. What we can't say is whether these people were killed to be eaten, or whether they died naturally. Were they even members of the same group?". And precisely how the cups were used cannot be known with total confidence either, although in more recent examples of such practice they have held blood, wine.. Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk

Avra' ormai lasciato la famiglia Ferrari ma Michael Schumacher non riesce a distaccarsi dalla pastasciutta all'italiana, almeno nei test. Appena gli impegni di pista glielo permettono, il pilota della Mercedes ne approfitta per fiondarsi nel motorhome della Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro per gustarsi un piatto di spaghetti aglio e olio: era successo la scorsa settimana a Valencia e si e' verificato di nuovo oggi a Jerez. Cosi' prima Carmine e poi Felice, i cuochi di pista della Scuderia, si sono dedicati ad una loro vecchia conoscenza: sapevano bene come soddisfarne il palato e l'ospite se n'e' andato contento. Si vede proprio che il potere della pasta e' ancora molto forte per Michael! Oppure il catering della sua nuova famiglia anglotedesca non e' all'altezza della situazione?

Transmembrane diffusion of hydrophobic antimicrobial agents and cell surface hydrophobicity in Bacteroides fragilis.
The transmembrane diffusion of hydrophobic antimicrobial agents, e.g. lincomycin and clindamycin, was examined in Bacteroides fragilis which is sensitive to these agents. The results showed that these agents penetrate efficiently through the outer membrane. Cell surface hydrophobicity measured by the partition assay between water and p-xylene revealed that the cell surface of B. fragilis is more hydrophobic than that of Salmonella typhimurium or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, treatment with low concentrations of surfactant caused cell lysis. These results suggest that the cell surface hydrophobicity in B. fragilis plays an important role in the efficient transmembrane penetration of hydrophobic compounds. This efficiency explains the susceptibility of B. fragilis to hydrophobic antimicrobial agents.

Employment Tribunal

An Employment Tribunal in Scotland is a tribunal where the court will listen to the claim of a person who thinks an employer or even potential employer has treated them unlawfully and draws conclusions to legal disputes concerned with employment law.

Legislation

Claims which may be brought to an Employment Tribunal in Scotland can include but are not limited to the following legislation:

– an unfair dismissal

– any form of discrimination

– unfair deductions from pay

– redundancy discrepancies

– terms of employment

– issues with notice periods

– maternity protection

Employment Appeal Tribunal

An Employment Appeal Tribunal, therefore, is a tribunal based in England, Wales and Scotland, that hears and handles appeals against decisions made by Employment Tribunals across the United Kingdom. It is an independent body that is bound to seek justice against errors undertaken in Employment Tribunals. It was set up to provide a fair, inexpensive and informal means for persons to rectify alleged infringements of their statutory rights in the workplace.

In order for an appeal to be heard, a legal mistake must have (or at least be thought to have) been made during the process and/or decision making at the Employment Tribunal, and parties must comply with rigidly enforced time limits when they apply for a review or an appeal. It is advised that the person who is looking to make an appeal asks the employment tribunal to send them the reasons for the decision if they do not already have them. It is permitted for a person to seek this information whilst continuing to apply for an appeal. Local Citizens Advice Bureaus will be more than happy to offer advice and support in undertaking an appeal.

Grounds

Grounds for an Employment Appeal Tribunal include, but are not limited to:

– getting the law wrong

– applying an incorrect law

– following incorrect procedures, thus affecting the conclusion drawn

– having no evidence to support the decision reached

– being unfairly biased towards the opposing party

Once an appeal has been drawn to a close, you can find the conclusion online by entering your reference number.

Use of very-low-calorie diets in the treatment of obese persons with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
This article discusses the use of very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs) in the treatment of obese persons with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Research using VLCDs with overweight participants with and without diabetes is reviewed. In both groups of participants, it has been shown that VLCDs used in combination with behavior therapy increase initial weight loss. However, to date, it has not been possible to develop treatment programs that maintain this weight loss long term. Neither intensive maintenance sessions nor intermittent VLCDs have been successful in maintaining the benefits of VLCDs long term. Thus, from the perspective of producing long-term weight loss, balanced low-calorie diets appear to be as effective as VLCDs. However, VLCDs may be useful in treating obese persons with NIDDM, because caloric restriction independent of notable weight loss has marked effects on glycemic control. Several studies have shown that just 7 days of caloric restriction can produce dramatic improvements in glycemic control; moreover, VLCDs produce greater improvements in glycemic control than more moderate diets, even if weight losses are the same. Research is needed to explore new ways to use VLCDs and other approaches to caloric restriction in the treatment of obese persons with NIDDM.

Space program produces new life-saving technology

PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — The space program has provided earthlings with yet another spinoff technology, one that could save thousands of lives after a disaster.

It’s called FINDER, an acronym for Finding Individuals for Disaster and Emergency Response. NASA and the Department of Homeland Security teamed up to develop the first-of-its-kind portable radar device to find victims trapped in rubble.

Using about one-100th the power of a cellphone, it can detect heartbeats and breathing as deep as 30 feet in crushed materials or behind 20 feet of solid concrete, and from a distance of 100 feet in open space. That means it can detect people even if they’re unconscious. Current listening devices work only if the victim makes some kind of sound.

The elite international seach and rescue team Task Force One from Fairfax County, Virginia, is helping to test the FINDER tool, which is expected to be available for use next year.

FINDER is based on remote-sensing radar technology developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, to monitor the location of spacecraft.

The Welch Consulting Employment Index showed no change in November, holding steady at its highest level since December, 2008. At 98.6, the index is 0.6 points higher than it was in December 2014.. The Welch Index measures full-time equivalent employment after adjustment for population growth and the aging of the workforce. The Index value of 98.6 indicates that adjusted full-time equivalent employment is 1.4% below its level in the base year of 2004.).. The flat index over the past month masks differing index changes for men and women. The index for men fell 0.2 points in November, from 97.1 to 96.9, while the index for women rose 0.3, to 100.8. For calendar year 2015 as a whole the index for women has been stronger than that for men, reporting a gain of 0.8 points compared to a 0.4.

Caster Semenya is challenging a new rule that could prevent her from competing in women’s track, but only if she has XY chromosomes.

Semenya has been tearing up the track since she first burst onto the world scene in 2009, blowing away her competition in Berlin. It was about that time when her gender came into question, as critics suggested that she “looked masculine” or was “astoundingly quick.”

She went on to win gold in both the 2012 Summer Olympics in London and the 2016 games in Rio de Janeiro.

WATCH:

While no medical tests have been publicly released, leaks and speculation have led many to believe that Semenya is possibly intersex — and one BBC correspondent claimed that her tests revealed testosterone levels that were three times that of the average female competitor.

The new ruling from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), coupled with the fact that Semenya is fighting the ruling, suggests that at least some of the speculation was accurate.

In order to comply with that ruling, female athletes with increased testosterone levels would be forced to take medication lowering those levels in order to compete as women. (RELATED: Lesbian Activist Defends ‘Biological Reality’ After Being Booted From Baltimore LGBTQ Commission)

Semenya challenged the ruling and garnered support from Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who challenged her competition to “stop tweeting and start competing.”

A note to her competition: Stop tweeting and start competing.https://t.co/rBu3m5znmf — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) May 4, 2019

U.S. women’s soccer star Abby Wambach suggested that Semenya was being targeted because of her race, asking, “I wonder how i escaped this type of discrimination? Qwhite a mystery.”

Yes! I love this. And @caster800m we support you and you are a champion. I wonder how i escaped this type of discrimination? Qwhite a mystery. #wolfpack https://t.co/BpX8ZyRpuc — Abby Wambach (@AbbyWambach) May 4, 2019

But what many critics and media outlets are omitting entirely is that the ruling, according to a May 1 press release from the Court of Arbitration for Sport, only applies to athletes who have XY chromosomes, who are considered to be genetically male.

The DSD covered by the Regulations are limited to athletes with “46 XY DSD” – i.e. conditions where the affected individual has XY chromosomes. Accordingly, individuals with XX chromosomes are not subject to any restrictions or eligibility conditions under the DSD Regulations.

That this ruling affects Semenya’s ability to compete at all suggests that she, too, had XY chromosomes and is therefore considered by the IAAF to be genetically male.

Regardless, stories published by the Associated Press, BBC, NPR and a number of others addressed the ruling by only noting that she had been told to lower her testosterone in order to compete. They did not mention the fact that the only reason the ruling even applied to her was that she was considered to be genetically male.

Vox took the statement a step further, saying that the ruling was made specifically to target Semenya. “Many saw the rules as a direct effort to target Semenya, who is believed to have a condition that produces high testosterone,” the outlet reported.

The same article later noted that, “In denying Semenya’s appeal, the Court of Arbitration for Sport acknowledged that the IAAF testosterone regulations were discriminatory toward athletes with naturally high testosterone.” The author still failed to acknowledge that the “naturally high testosterone” being “discriminatory” in this case was the result of being born with XY chromosomes.

NY Mag contributor Jesse Singal summed up the problem with the media’s reporting on the issue, saying, “You basically cannot trust mainstream outlets anymore on any scientifically complex story that brushes up against culture-war issues.”

You basically cannot trust mainstream outlets anymore on any scientifically complex story that brushes up against culture-war issues. It’s incredibly depressing to watch standards slide but that’s where we are. Not sure what to recommend to people.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Saturday said that institutions have weakened under BJP government as judiciary was not intervening promptly on important matters involving citizens’ rights such as Article 370 , leading to anxiety among citizens.It said that on the issue of Article 370, the Supreme Court has constituted a constitutional bench but has not started the hearing.Addressing a press conference, AICC spokesman Anand Sharma said, “There has been institutional subversion and the institutions which I expected to administer and deliver justice to uphold India’s constitutional democracy and fundamental rights of citizens have been weakened. We have expected throughout that the judiciary of this country, being the custodian of the statute, shall protect its foundational values and citizens’ fundamental rights. There are concerns that timely intervention and delivery is not taking place.”The former Union minister and deputy leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha said, “When serious constitutional matters come up, those should be taken up promptly. You cannot delay issues pertaining to the Constitution by months. We hope that will not happen and the judiciary will rise to the occasion to reassure the citizens that the foundational values of the Indian Constitution shall remain protected and secured.”He said delay in timely intervention on many constitutional matters leads to questions marks in the global community while also disheartening the people it concerns.At the same time, Sharma accused the BJP government of persecuting opposition leaders, referring to the legal troubles of former home minister and Rajya Sabha MP P Chidambaram and of Karnataka leader D K Shivakumar and other opposition leaders. “There can be differences of views but in a democracy, the rights of all citizens which are guaranteed under the Constitution should be protected. These concerns are bonafide concerns,” he said.“Are there two sets of rules and two sets of laws in the Republic of India — one that governs the opposition and one that benefits ruling party leaders,” Sharma asked.

Q:

Error:(67, 51) java: diamond operator is not supported in -source 1.6 (use -source 7 or higher to enable diamond operator)

I want to use this library, I cloned it and imported it into IntelliJ IDEA 14.0.3, with JDK 1.8.0_77, but when I want to run the main method I get this error:
Error:(422, 50) java: diamond operator is not supported in -source 1.6
  (use -source 7 or higher to enable diamond operator)

what is going on here? how can I resolve it?

A:

You are using a collection with the new (in Java 7) diamond operator,
List<Integer> al = new ArrayList<>(); // <-- the diamond operator.

In earlier versions of Java, you must specify the generic on the right hand side like
List<Integer> al = new ArrayList<Integer>(); // <-- No diamond operator.

or you could modify your IDE preferences to target Java 7+.



It’s Friday the 13th September and as well as being unlucky for some it’s…. So, when on your bike today, as part of your commute, group ride, or just popping down the street for some cake, take a photograph of that piece of infrastructure that you like, as well as one of that makes your heart sink every time you use it or pass it.. Post these photos to social media, with some witty comments, as well as tagging the location, including the street name, then final adding the hashtag #GlasgowCycleInfraDay19. It would also help us greatly if you could also add your posts (other social media platforms are available). There have been lots of posts already added this morning already.. Remember, this is supposed to be an easy way of documenting a day in the life of Glasgow’s cycling infrastructure. So please be sensible; bus most importantly… have fun!

The City has identified and developed a plan to study 67 different areas of Toronto in order to determine the cause of basement and road surface flooding and develop sewer/drainage improvement plans.. In 2019, the City initiated sewer capacity Assessment engineering studies for the last 21 of the 67 study areas. This accelerated process is to develop sewer improvement (upsize and storage) and catchbasin management plans within the City’s right-of-way (roads).. In 2022, for each basement flooding area, a Class Environmental Assessment (EA) study is conducted. These are complex studies that can take 18 months or more to complete. Potential drainage improvements for these studies can include new underground storage facility and wet/dry pond management to reduce the risk of future flooding.

Abstract. A phage display system was developed and used to select zinc finger proteins with altered DNA-binding specificities. The three zinc fingers of the Zif268 protein were expressed on the surface of filamentous phage, and a library of variants was prepared by randomizing critical amino acids in the first zinc finger. Affinity selections, using DNA sites with base changes in the region recognized by the first finger, yielded Zif268 variants that bound tightly and specifically to the new sites. This phage system provides a tool for the study of protein-DNA interactions and may offer a general method for selecting zinc finger proteins that recognize desired target sites on double-stranded DNA.

Antidamping-Torque-Induced Switching in Biaxial Antiferromagnetic Insulators.
We investigate the current-induced switching of the Néel order in NiO(001)/Pt heterostructures, which is manifested electrically via the spin Hall magnetoresistance. Significant reversible changes in the longitudinal and transverse resistances are found at room temperature for a current threshold lying in the range of 10^{7} A/cm^{2}. The order-parameter switching is ascribed to the antiferromagnetic dynamics triggered by the (current-induced) antidamping torque, which orients the Néel order towards the direction of the writing current. This is in stark contrast to the case of antiferromagnets such as Mn_{2}Au and CuMnAs, where fieldlike torques induced by the Edelstein effect drive the Néel switching, therefore resulting in an orthogonal alignment between the Néel order and the writing current. Our findings can be readily generalized to other biaxial antiferromagnets, providing broad opportunities for all-electrical writing and readout in antiferromagnetic spintronics.

The transition into motion three years ago was an easy one for Scott. Always on the forefront of trends and what art buyers are looking for, Scott saw the opportunity with the capabilities of the new HD DLSR camera. He found it exciting to bring still images to life with motion and create full commercials. The sophistication of the camera, combined with software such as Final Cut Pro and After Effects creates professional video very cost-efficiently. Scott has blended his still photography skills with motion and video, to create more than 20 commercials. With clients wanting to maximize the reach of their advertising campaigns, the ability to "wear the hats" of both a still photographer and videographer creates the desired results effectively and efficiently. He believes the days of just being a still photographer are gone for most part.

Q:

Upper bound for largest eigenvalue of 0-1 matrix

I have large $(0-1)$-matrices with the additional property that the first row and the first column are almost all $1$'s. My question is

Is there a (good) algorithm to obtain an upper bound for the largest eigenvalue of such a matrix ?

This question actually didn't come up in my own research but some collaborator of mine asked this question at dinner these days. I thus don't know more about the background of the question, but my impression would be that if anything is known, this is the right place to ask.
Thanks, Christian

A:

EDIT: this answer was originally written in response to an older version of the question, which merely asked for upper bounds on the largest eigenvalue rather than an algorithm.

Take your matrix to have all entries equal to $1$ to get a matrix which has $n$ as an eigenvalue.
Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with $0$-$1$ entries. Let $x=(x_1,\dots, x_n)^\top$ and calculate
$$ \begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=1}^n \left\vert \sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij} x_j\right\vert^2
& \leq
n \left( \sum_{j=1}^n \vert x_j\vert \right)^2 \quad\hbox{(triangle inequality)} \\
& \leq
n^2 \sum_{j=1}^n \vert x_j\vert^2 \quad\hbox{(Cauchy-Schwarz)} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
to see that $\Vert Ax \Vert^2 \leq n^2 \Vert x\Vert^2$. So the norm (= largest singular value), and hence the largest eigenvalue, of $A$ is at most $n$. The example I gave at the start shows this is sharp.
The moral is that unless we have more information about this 0-1 matrix, very little informative can be said regarding upper bounds on the largest eigenvalue.

[Clarification: This story was originally published by the Associated Press in 2005.]

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is preparing to implement new rules that will ban men who have had sex with other men from acting as anonymous sperm donors. The agency claims to be adopting the measures as a means of protecting recipients from HIV transmission, but according to the Associated Press, LGBT rights groups have been quick to point out that not only is the policy discriminatory on its face, it isn’t based in scientific reality.

ADVERTISEMENT

“The part I find most offensive — and a little frightening — is that it isn’t based on good science,” Kevin Cathcart of Lambda Legal told the AP. “There’s a steadily increasing trend of heterosexual transmission of HIV, and yet the FDA still has this notion that you protect people by putting gay men out of the pool.”

FDA officials insist that gay men are at higher-than-average risk for contracting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, but critics of the new policy say that the agency would be better served by screening procedures that identify high-risk behaviors in all donors, regardless of sexual orientation. Activists have also asked that the FDA reverse its ruling that bars gay men from donating blood, particularly now that more effective HIV tests are in common use.

According to the global HIV/AIDS charity AVERT, only half of the HIV-positive men and male adolescents living in the U.S. contracted the virus through male-to-male sexual contact. In spite of what politicians like Tennessee Republican state Sen. Stacey Campfield (R) might say, AIDS is readily transmissible through heterosexual sex.

Leland Traiman, director of a California clinic that specializes in sperm donations from gay men, said, “Under these rules, a heterosexual man who had unprotected sex with HIV-positive prostitutes would be OK as a donor one year later, but a gay man in a monogamous, safe-sex relationship is not OK unless he’s been celibate for five years.”

Traiman’s clinic tests donors for all STDs at the time of donation, then freeze the semen for six months, at which point the donor is tested again. If no illnesses are present, the donated sperm are cleared for use.

ADVERTISEMENT

Cathcart calls the new rules, which are part of changing guidelines for all tissue and cell donation, “A policy based on bigotry.”

Dr. Deborah Cohan, head of gynecology and obstetrics at the University of California, San Francisco said that the ban will have consequences among LGBT families looking to have children. Many lesbian couples seeking donor sperm favor semen from gay donors on the grounds that the men are more likely to be accepting and supportive of households headed by a same sex couple.

Cohen said she is baffled by the bad. “This rule will make things legally more difficult for them. I can’t think of a scientifically valid reason — it has to be an issue of discrimination.”

Nearly 15,000 Low-Income New Mexico Families Have Crossed the Digital Divide Through Comcast’s Internet Essentials Program

2 years ago

According to a five-year progress report, Comcast’s acclaimed Internet Essentials program has helped connect 14,900 New Mexico families to low-cost, high-speed internet service at home.

“In the last five years, we’ve worked proudly with local community partners as part of the national movement to bridge the digital divide that exists among low-income families everywhere,” said Chris Dunkeson, Comcast Area Vice President. “With the announcement of our expansion to HUD-assisted homes, we look forward to bringing this essential connection to even more families and homes.”

Comcast recently announced it expanded the program’s eligibility to households receiving HUD-housing assistance, including public housing, Housing Choice Voucher, and Multifamily programs. In New Mexico, there are approximately 18,000 families living in HUD-assisted homes in Comcast service areas who will now have access to low-cost internet service through Internet Essentials. The announcement means even more individuals, including seniors, veterans, and adults without children are now eligible to apply to the program.

Nationwide, here’s who Internet Essentials has connected so far:

were received to when a final printed and
casted model was ready to ship.

Dr. Abdulrauf and his team used the
3D printed models to plan surgical procedures and then actually rehearse them
using the same types of instruments and
equipment they would be using on the
live patient. The initial results from these
early trials have been very promising.

“I’ve done a lot of aneurysm opera-tions in my career and I can confidentlysay that having the 3D printed modelhere has a very positive impact on theprocedure results,” Dr. Abdulrauf stated.“The model has helped to identify andovercome surgical challenges, like opti-mum access to the aneurysm or the depthand angle of the approach, before surgerybegins.”The trails also provided valuableinformation that will help make the nextgeneration of surgical models even moreuseful. For example, Dr. Abdulrauf toldMedical Device Technology that theworking feels of the printed materialscame close to that of actual tissue, buttheir surface texture did not provide accu-rate haptic feedback through the surgicalinstruments. He said that that one of thegoals of the next phase of developmentwill be to work on materials with morerealistic textures.

Now that these preliminary experiments have yielded positive results, the
next move is to measure the success of
3D printed models through a pair of blind
studies that Dr. Abdulrauf has proposed.
In the first study, resident neurosurgeons
will be asked to perform a procedure on a
cadaver. Half of the residents will prepare
for the surgery using a 3D printed model
of the cadaver’s while the other half will
prepare for the surgery in the conventional manner. The performance of the
two groups will be compared in a blind
study by a team of assessors who will
not know which group received the 3D
printed model. Success will be measured
by the duration of the procedure, absence
of errors, and how well the surgical teams
are able to keep the circumference of the
surgery as small as possible and minimize
disturbances to adjacent healthy tissue.

A second study will compare the out-comes of two groups of patients receivingsimilar operations and a similar standardof care. The only difference will be thatthe neurosurgeons in one group will re-ceive a 3D printed model of their brain topractice on prior to surgery. Both groupswill be assessed on the basis of patientrecovery time and overall patient comfortpost-surgery. Once the studies are funded,Dr. Abdulrauf hopes to gain deeper, morequantified insights into the how 3D print-ing can positively impact the outcome ofsurgical procedures. MDT

Independent Lens: Race to Execution - an early look

The death penalty, not unlike abortion rights, is a polarizing topic, and advocates on both sides of the death penalty debate have strong feelings about a state's right to end the life of a human being.

In "Race to Execution," which airs on PBS' Independent Lens on March 27 at 10:00 p.m., the question as to whether race plays a role in death penalty convictions is made the center focus. One story deals with Madison Hobley, a Chicago man sentenced to death for allegedly setting a fire that killed seven people, including his wife and young child. The other story deals with Robert Tarver, accused of shooting a white general store owner in Alabama. In the end, one man is executed and the other is exonerated.

The documentary takes the stance that a person's race, and the overall race of the jury, does play a significant role in whether or not a person is sentenced to death. However, the two people behind the film, Rachel Lyon and Jim Lopes, are on both sides of the debate (Lopes supports the death penalty and Lyon does not). No single work can serve as the ultimate Truth on the death penalty, but "Race to Execution" does offer one angle that's worth considering for anyone interested in educating themselves about this issue, no matter what their belief happens to be.

The Latino Community Center was founded in 1999 and has grown quickly from one small after-school program to a full array of programs serving community members of all ages.

The Center was featured in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article as one of the “Ten Reasons for Hope” for the city of Milwaukee.

The Center serves one of Milwaukee’s most diverse and impoverished communities on Milwaukee’s near Southside, including the 53204 and 53215 zip codes. It is a young, ethnically and racially diverse neighborhood, in which young people 17 and under make up almost a third of the population.

The Latino Community Center’s (LCC) mission is to “meet and respect youth and families where they are — re-empowering them to change their negative situations into positive personal, academic and professional outcomes through programs that strengthen their abilities and aspirations.”

The Center’s programming is based on best practices in the field of positive youth development to ensure effectiveness. Structured and unstructured, bilingual and bicultural opportunities reach a wide variety of at-risk youth in the area, including gang members, young girls, out-of-school youth and teenaged males.

The strength of LCC lies in a strong grassroots community approach. The majority of the staff and volunteers were raised and continue to live in the neighborhood served by the LCC.

Youth seek out the Center as a safe place where they can be with positive adult role models and stay away from dangerous situations. LCC provides a Young Professionals Academy (YPA) where students are guided through three phases of comprehensive training: (1) Employability Skills (2) Job Retention Skills (3) and Life Skills.

In addition, LCC runs Community Learning Centers (CLC) at Kagel Elementary School and South Division High School and a program called ¡Soy Unica! ¡Soy Latina! (“I’m Unique! I’m a Latin Girl!”), designed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration as a bilingual initiative to help Latina girls ages 9-14 to gain the self-esteem needed to make healthy choices, learn refusal skills, and resist negative social pressures.

Teen Nights offered at the Center twice a week for teens only, featuring poetry, music, dancing and art to impart positive lessons about self-esteem, staying in school, and more. And Summer Programming gives youth and teens in the target neighborhood a safe place to go during the summer months, with a wide array of fun, safe, academic, recreational, social, and cultural activities including but not limited to summer school, homework help, and field trips such as swimming, bowling, miniature golf, movies, museum, zoo, basketball and football.

The LCC is a safe haven for many youth on Milwaukee’s near south side community and a good neighbor in the hood.

Rusyns and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)

Rusyns and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia during the period from 1918 to 1938, were ethnic Rusyns and ethnic Ukrainians of the First Czechoslovak Republic, representing two main ethnic communities in the most eastern region of Czechoslovakia, known during that period as the Subcarpathian Rus.

History
The region of Subcarpathian Rus was economically poorest region of Czechoslovakia. In 1914 the region was referred to by one historian as "little more than a Magyar deer park." Its people were wretchedly poor, having for centuries supplemented the meagre living the mountainous area afforded with seasonal agricultural labor and service in the Hungarian infantry.

Subcarpathian Rus was a hotbed of secessionist sentiment throughout the inter-war period. These were manifested by strong cultural and linguistic links with the Ukrainians, in the Soviet Union and interwar Poland. There were also calls for Ukrainian autonomy within the Czechoslovak Republic, and calls for the formation of a Lemko-Rusyn Republic on the northern side of the Carpathians, attempted to unite with this faction. 

During World War I, Rusyn leaders had reached an agreement with Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk to secure autonomy to Subcarpathian region within a future Czechoslovak state.  The agreement received international sanction in the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain. The Paris Peace Conference had also stipulated earlier that year that Subcarpathian Rus be granted full autonomy and promised the territory a diet having legislative power in all matters of local administration. However, the constitution of 1920 limited the provision on autonomy, making reference to the requirements of the unity of the state. All legislation of Subcarpathian Rus was made subject to approval by the president of the republic, and the governor of Subcarpathian Rus was to be nominated by the president. As a result, even the constitutional provision for regional autonomy was never implemented; the regional diet of Subcarpathian Rus was never convened. The issue of autonomy became a major source of discontent. Other grievances included the placement of the western boundary—which left 150,000 Rusyns in Slovakia—and the large numbers of Czechs brought to Subcarpathian Rus as administrators and educators. Political life in Subcarpathian Rus was characterized by a proliferation of political parties and a diversity of cultural tendencies. All Czechoslovak political parties were represented, and a number of indigenous parties emerged as well. Of particular significance were the Ukrainophiles, Russophiles, Hungarians, and communists.

Political movements
Ukrainophile and Russophile tendencies were strengthened by the large influx of émigrés following the war. 

The Ukrainophiles were largely members of the Eastern Catholic Churches and espoused autonomy within Czechoslovakia. Some favored union with Soviet Ukraine. The Ukrainophiles were represented by the National Christian Party led by Avgustyn Voloshyn. 

The russophile part of the population was largely Eastern Orthodox and also espoused regional autonomy. They were organized politically in the Agricultural Federation, led by Andrej Brody, and the fascist-style Fencik Party. 

Hungarians populated a compact area in southern parts of Subcarpathian Rus. They were represented by the Unified Magyar Party, which consistently received ten percent of the vote in the region and was in permanent opposition to the government. 

The communists, strong in the poor province, attempted to appeal to the Ukrainian element by espousing union with Soviet Ukraine. In 1935 the communists polled 25 percent of the vote in Subcarpathian Rus. The elections of 1935 gave only 37 percent of the Rusyn vote to political parties supporting the Czechoslovak government. The communists, Unified Magyars, and autonomist groups polled 63 percent.

Sufi Paranja Katha (film)

Sufi Paranja Katha is a Malayalam-language film directed by Priyanandanan based on K. P. Ramanunni's novel with the same title. Ramanunni himself wrote the story, screenplay, and dialogues for the film. Thampi Antony, Prakash Bare, and Sharbani Mukherjee did the main roles in this film. The film has been distributed by Central Pictures.

Plot
This film is a narrative by Sufi (Babu Antony), a Muslim scholar.

Karthy (Sharbani Mukherjee) belongs to a prestigious Hindu tharavadu. She falls in love with a Muslim trader named Mamootty (Prakash Bare) and starts living in Mamootty's house after converting to Islam. But she doesn't give up her original beliefs of her original religion Hinduism. To save Karthy from the need to go to the temple, Mamootty builds one inside his house. When the local Muslim people came to know about this, they create problems and this forces the couple to move apart.

Writing
Ramanunni says he had no intention of making the novel into a film. But producer, Kalam Karasseri, had wanted to do a film based on it for years and Ramanunni complied. Ramanunni says he has not deviated much from the novel and wrote the script with a lot of care as it dealt with a sensitive theme. "In order to enhance cinematic effects, only one small portion of the story has been done away with and the anti-colonial sentiments have been highlighted. The dialogues of the film celebrate the co-existence of different religions," says Ramanunni.

Awards
It was one of three Indian films selected for International competition section of the 2010 edition of the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK). It won four Kerala State Film Awards.

Discussion in 'News' started by Hybrid, Apr 19, 2017.. I'd pay good money to hear Chester or Brad rap Stormzy's part with a horrible fake accent.. There are 3 verses.. Probably means his original third verse because I assume he's just going to do Pusha's verse like he did Rakim's. Nah, Mike wrote two verses and a breakdown before Push recorded a verse. It's safer to say that they'll just do the demo version or a version similar since Pusha T's verse is uhh...very Pusha T. Separate names with a comma.

Chicago Alderman Joe Moore is reported to have admitted being contracted by the FBI after Chicago’s Legislative Inspector General turned over information about his having used his office for political purposes.. The complaints were “about allegations he improperly paid two aides he fired,” the Chicago Tribune reports.. Meanwhile President Barack Obama is set to honor Moore as “a pioneer for political reform, governmental transparency and democratic governance.”. = = = = =. No one would ask or allow McHenry County employees to do political work on the taxpayers’ dime, would they?. Well D’oh!. Chicago. Democrats.. WHAT ELSE DO YOU EXPECT?!?

Q:

A proof in circles

The question is this:
Show that the equation of a straight line meeting the circle $ x^2 + y^2 = a^2 $ in two points at equal distances $d$ from a point $(m, n)$ on its circumference is 
$ mx + ny - a^2 + \dfrac {d^2} {2} $
I am confused. Hints please!
EDIT:
I tried to relate the perpendicular distance between the line and $(m, n)$ but then I seem to be getting nowhere.

A:

Let $p, q$ be the two intersections of the line with the circle:
$$x^2 + y^2 - a^2 = 0\tag{*1}$$
Since $p$ and $q$ are at distance $d$ from the point $(m,n)$, $p$, $q$ lies on another 
circle:
$$(x - m)^2 + (y - n)^2 - d^2 = 0\tag{*2}$$
$(*1) - (*2)$ implies $p, q$ also satisfy:
$$\begin{align}&2mx - m^2 + 2nx - n^2 - a^2 + d^2 = 0\\
\iff & 2mx + 2ny - 2 a^2 + d^2 = 0\\
\iff & mx + ny - a^2 + \frac{d^2}{2} = 0
\end{align}$$
This is the equation of a line and since two points determine a line, this is the equation we want.

Is Windows 7 Actually Faster Than Ubuntu 10.04?

05-03-2010, 08:20 AM

Phoronix: Is Windows 7 Actually Faster Than Ubuntu 10.04?

While Linux has long been talked about as being a faster operating system than Microsoft Windows, in 2010 is this still the case? It seems every time we deliver new benchmarks of the EXT4 file-system it's actually getting slower, recent Linux kernel releases have not been delivering any major performance enhancements for desktop users, the open-source Linux graphics drivers are still no match to the proprietary drivers, and "bloated and huge" is how Linus Torvalds described the Linux kernel last year. This is all while Windows 7 was released last year, which many view as Microsoft's best operating system release to date. Even after using it a fair amount the past few months in preparation for this about-to-be-shared work, it is actually not too bad and is a huge improvement over Windows Vista, but is it really faster than Ubuntu Linux? We have used six uniquely different systems and ran Microsoft Windows 7 Professional x64 and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS x86_64 on each of them with a set of 55 tests (actually, more than 165 if considering that each test is usually run at least three times for accuracy) per installation.

The article is only a Ubuntu vs Windows comparison, not Linux vs Windows. Ubuntu does not represent Linux. If you want to compare performance of Windows and Linux, you should choose Linux From Scratch (LFS) or Slackware.

Comment

Well i would have use Kanotix instead of Ubuntu but the results are logical to some degree. However there was no killer app under the multiplattform ones to be only useable with Win (except games on i3). Usually Win drivers select a specific optimization for an app/game depending on the executeable name. I expected this at least for Unigine Heaven, but maybe only in the DX modes. ATI seems to be even too stupid to deliver good Win drivers as SpecViewPerf does not run correctly there.

Comment

Despite Linux graphical drivers have improved a lot in last years, Windows graphical performance is still the stronget aspect of Windows platform. Maybe that's because this aspect has been worked for years in Windows and Linux graphical system and drivers have to walk this way as well. Hopefully in two years we can talk about the opposite result! :-)

Comment

The article is only a Ubuntu vs Windows comparison, not Linux vs Windows. Ubuntu does not represent Linux. If you want to compare performance of Windows and Linux, you should choose Linux From Scratch (LFS) or Slackware.

It would be pretty pointless to compare LFS to Windows 7 since it doesn't even have X, let alone a modern desktop environment. Slackware might work, but I don't see how it's any more representative of Linux (let alone desktop Linux) than Ubuntu is.

Comment

IMO it would however be even MORE interesting to see some productivity tests especially concerning latency ("lagging" of the mouse pointer) and possibility of using the GUI during heavy I/O

in those cases the Linux-Kernel with >2.6.33 (2.6.34 in that regard is perfect) with CFQ and CFS (or BFS) schedulers are the only platform at which I can almost always work - even Windows 7 64bit Home Premium is unusable (Windows 2008 R2 Server should be somewhat better but I don't have time to test that)

some work cases:

- copying 700 GiBs of data from one partition to another (with both partitions encrypted)
- indexing around 140,000 files (mostly PDF ebooks and universitary scripts) with an desktop search engine (e.g. recoll, beagle, tracker, pinot, etc.) which continually puts load on the CPU and harddrives - under windows an example would be copernic desktop search (the others I tried including docfetcher, puggle wouldn't index all files and only a pretty low folder hierarchy; google-desktop would pause during I/O)

Comment

These benchmarks compared almost only the quality of the graphics drivers.
How about actual OS/kernel benchmarks, like memory management and file-systems performance?

Did you read the article or just look at the graphs?

More of the Windows 7 vs. Ubuntu 10.04 (and Mac OS X) tests will follow in the coming weeks for non-gaming areas. The Windows support upbringing will also allow us to closely compare and monitor the performance of Wine (the free software project that allows the running of many Windows binaries under Linux), which too will be coming soon and should be interesting.

What I missed much here was the boot-time comparsion that was one of the biggest advantage of windows 7 and the new ubuntu version. (Or did I miss it only?)

Besides that, I learned that the Intel Linux driver isn?t that good how I thought (speed), I thought it would be the best Linux driver + additional open source, but I now think it?s only the best Driver from the open ones

here would be a comparsion of the nouvou, radeon and intel driver be interesting (at least for me). I know its not fair because Intel gpu-hardware sucks (in speed terms) but maybe the 2 other free drivers are so bad that Intel wins because of the better driver? (All 3 should be tested on latest/best igp-solutions).

But for free software guys (instead of open source folks) or paranoid guys, this 3d benches are not so importend because I would not install such a binary driver, and even more not propreitary games which no one can look into the source, if there are some adware in it or not.

So because virtualisation-solutions doesnt work very good for games (good 3d speed), I must have a dualboot solution (or a pc only for gaming) anyway the only point would be to have a special gaming-linux instead of the gaming-windows. But the propreitary Ati-linux drivers are such unstable I would not go for a gaming Linux.

But I know most people aren?t paranoid, and trust companys, and they use Linux only because they think that in some importent aspects they like it more than Windows. (Better developer plattform, better desktop...) So it?s good to make such tests.

Plp, please don't get too much into ubuntu vs. the rest. I believe that the great conclusion to draw from this article is that linux distros like ubuntu ARE on par with the expected performance for gaming.

Remember that anything beyond 60fps (the max. a common lcd will display) is perfectly fluid.

The message to all is: when buying or building a new gaming rig, those $dollars$ to Microsoft Windows that WERE considered essential are no more than optional. Windows price is, at the best, 15% of the total cost of the system - for example, a nice upgrade to the video card should be better that wasting with windows.

Attempts have been made to reproduce reactions such as a double-loop and a triple-loop which occurs in a human brain determination process, using techniques of the related art such as a Von Neumann computer, artificial intelligence, a neural network, and deep learning.
On the other hand, techniques for estimating the state of a human, such as emotion or physiology, without using a calculation method (that is, binary system) using a huge number of switches have been proposed. For example, in Patent Document 1, a deviation amount of homeostasis in a test subject is obtained using information indicating the physiological state of the test subject and information indicating emotions and organ activities, such as the brain, of the test subject, and energy which involves in emotions and organ activities of the test subject is calculated from the obtained deviation amount. In Patent Document 1, a technique is proposed in which a plurality of gears indicating the emotions and each of the organ activities of the test subject are rotated in a virtual space using the calculated energy to estimate the pathology of the test subject from the state of rotation of each gear.

President Shimon Peres will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Thursday to open the world’s largest Jewish museum.

President Shimon Peres will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Thursday to open the Russian Jewish Tolerance Museum, the world’s largest Jewish museum.

Russian officials said Putin also invited Peres to discuss current events in the Middle East and northern Africa.

Russia's Chief Rabbi Berel Lazar also has invited former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to visit the Tolerance Center.

"Jews feel confident and comfortable in today's Russia. I am happy that it has become possible largely due to the political process which I began," Gorbachev was quoted by the press service for the Federation of Jewish Communities during a meeting with Lazar.

Alexander Boroda, said President of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia, said work began in 2007 to create the museum project, which he originated along with Rabbi Lazar.

The Russian Jewish Museum of Tolerance is designed to bring together different cultural traditions through the prism of Jewish culture, to develop ideas of tolerance and harmony.

The center includes state-of-the art technology to teach the Creation, the Giving of the Ten Commandments on Har Sinai, the Holy Temples, life in the Diaspora and Jewish suffering throughout the generations.

It will be the biggest Jewish museum in the world, with an area of 17,000 square meters, while the area of exposition dedicated to history of Jewish people is 4,500 square meter.

It will house several museum expositions, a library, a scientific center, conference halls and exhibition galleries. The ground floor of the two-story educational and exhibition complex will be located underground.

Boroda has said that the reawakening of Jewish life in the region has crowded Moscow’s five synagogues, and that more will be established, along with Jewish schools.

The Moscow museum is in addition to the new and large cultural center and Holocaust museum opened recently in the Ukraine.

Named the "Menorah Center," it includes seven buildings and houses thousands of artifacts plus a community center, hotel, kosher restaurant, and art galleries.

The seven-tower, twenty-story museum and center multiplex, cost an estimated $60 million.

Well, it's the end to another fabulous year and I'm ready to see what next year brings!! My first show of 2012 is going to be at the new Lamp Post Bar in Fresno,. I will have 8 paintings on display there for ArtHop, January 5th. Hope to see you out there!!. Here is my final painting from class, it's an acrylic/mixed media portrait of the "american girl".. This next painting was a commission, and I've heard that shereally loves it and was very surprised to received it on Christmas Eve.. This was another commission that was a Christmas Gift. And this last one was a commission that went along with 2 previously completed paintings. She now happily owns 3 of them and has them hung in her bathroom. :-). Thank you to everyone who commissioned me to create a painting this holiday season. stay tuned for a new series of paintings related to the astrological signs. I'm going to have to do some research on this and then get started on this new series!!! I'll also have a few new valentine's themed paintings ♥

Baptiste, West to serve as evaluators at USA regional combines

West Indies national selector Eldine Baptiste and West Indies U-19 coach Graeme West are set to join Mike Young as the lead talent evaluators at US scouting combines, which is being held in eight cities around the USA over the next two months, beginning this weekend in Los Angeles. Baptiste and West's appointment was announced on Wednesday by the ICC Americas office, which is coordinating each scouting combine.

"I am thoroughly looking forward to working with Mike Young as well as the ICC Americas and local cricket community on this project" Baptiste said. "It is a great opportunity for the players across the USA and extremely exciting for the development of the game."

Baptiste has prior experience working in an Associate cricket setup. Baptiste coached Kenya from September 2009 to April 2011, but stepped down shortly after Kenya's win-less performance at the 2011 World Cup in India.

The candidates at each city-based combine will also be put through a series of skills, fitness and agility tests conducted by BAM (Basic Athletic Measurement) Testing. BAM conducts skills and agility tests at the annual NBA Draft Rookie Combine. Headquartered in Seattle, BAM was founded in 2008 by former Dallas Mavericks head strength and conditioning coach Brett Brungardt.

"I'm intrigued to see how these cricketers stack up against some of the best athletes I've seen in basketball and other major US sports," Brungardt said ahead of the first regional combine in Los Angeles.

Young and ICC Americas high performance consultant Tom Evans are the two main holdovers from the trial held last September in Indianapolis, which also featured players from Argentina, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Canada and Suriname. Venkatapathy Raju and Courtney Walsh were utilized as the lead talent evaluators at that combine along with Young.

This weekend's trial in Los Angeles is the first of eight city-based trials conducted by the ICC to establish a national-team talent pool at men's, women's and U-17 levels. At the end of the eight trials, concluding in New York, the ICC is expected to name a group of 20-30 players in each category for a second round of auditions to be held later in the summer.

More than 100 applications were received for the men's trial in Los Angeles, with 55 players making the final list of invitees. They include eight current or former USA senior team players and six former USA U-19 players. The first trial for women's and U-17 players will take place in San Francisco from April 14.

Q:

What are the differences between Event Sourcing and Service Layer pattern?

I am reading a book on architecting enterprise applications. In this book the Event Sourcing pattern is introduced which can be used as the "command" part of a Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) architecture. Event Sourcing is described by Martin Fowler as:

The fundamental idea of Event Sourcing is that of ensuring every change to the state of an application is captured in an event object, and that these event objects are themselves stored in the sequence they were applied for the same lifetime as the application state itself.

I am used to applications that use the Service Layer pattern, which I would describe as: changes in the UI call a method, which then triggers the appropriate service call in a middleware layer which delegates the call to the backend where information is updated and notifies the caller of the result. 
This description of a Service Layer does, to me, not seem very different from Event Sourcing. 
What are the differences between Event Sourcing and the Service Layer pattern?

A:

Those two things do not much have in common, except the fact that also in the Service Layer pattern some kind of "events" may be involved. But that is where commonalities end. 

in the "Service Layer pattern", there are different layers calling each other and triggering some system change. But the calls are not necessarily "captured in event objects", nor are the calls necessarily stored anywhere.
in Event Sourcing, there is not necessarily a result notification back to the caller, that is not part of the pattern

Actually, one way of implementing Event sourcing is to let the service layer take the UI calls, encapsulate them in event objects and feed them to the event queue. The service layer can also try to generate an appropriate result notification for the UI. So these two patterns can work perfectly together, but mostly because they are orthogonal.

Feed Delivery Methods' Effects on Glucose, Insulin Response

According to recently published study results, feeding methods that slow horses' feed consumption rate can also reduce their insulin and glucose responses directly after the meal.

There are a number of ways to help prevent insulin resistance (IR) or associated conditions like laminitis in horses, but did you know that how you feed your horse could be one of them? According to recently published study results, feeding methods that slow horses’ feed consumption rate can also reduce their insulin and glucose responses directly after the meal.

“We wanted to see if there were other things an owner could do from a management standpoint to minimize glucose/insulin responses to feed … simply by altering how they deliver the feed to the horse,” explained researcher Shannon Pratt-Phillips, PhD, associate professor at North Carolina State University's Department of Animal Science.

In the first of two experiments, Pratt-Phillips and colleagues investigated four different feed delivery methods' effects on the glucose/ insulin responses of eight mature healthy horses of varying breeds.

The researchers fed the horses a single concentrate meal (2 g/kg of body weight of a 26% nonstructural carbohydrate [NSC] pelleted feed) once per week, randomly assigning four separate feed delivery methods:

Water—an unaltered bucket with concentrate soaked in an equal portion of water for 20 minutes.

On treatment days, the researchers fitted the horses with a jugular catheter to collect blood samples. Between treatments, horses were housed in individual partially-covered runs and fed mixed grass hay with access to mineral blocks and water.

The research data revealed that both the ball and waffle treatments increased the time it took the horses to consume feed (TCF) by nearly 50% compared to control and water treatments. Additionally, the team found that the ball treatment produced the lowest glucose and insulin responses of the four treatments.

In a second experiment, performed nearly one year after the first experiment, the team evaluated the efficacy of the same four feeding methods over a four-day period on four healthy mature geldings.

The team found that TCF varied over the four-day period and concluded that, although further studies are likely needed, “obstacles in a feed bucket can be considered effective at maintaining increased TCF after multiple days of use.”

While not all IR or laminitic horses require concentrates in their diets, if a supplemental feed is needed, choose and feed carefully. “Select one with low levels of NSC, and try to feed it in as many meals per day as possible," Pratt-Phillips said. "Also try to slow down feeding rate by either using obstacles in your horse's feed tub, or even placing the feed into two or three feed tubs in his stall.”

Q:

Number of arrangements of the $10\heartsuit|9\heartsuit|8\heartsuit|5\spadesuit|2\clubsuit$

Let's say that the original ordering of the cards is $10\heartsuit|9\heartsuit|8\heartsuit|5\spadesuit|2\clubsuit$ and then we shuffle the cards.
I declare these two random variables and I want to calculate the probability of their outcomes:
$X$-number of cards that stayed in the same place after the shuffle.
$Y$-number of the heart suit cards that stayed in the same place after the shuffle.
For $X$ I have looked at this as the probability of picking the right place
$$\small{Pr[X=0]=\frac{D(5)}{5!}, Pr[X=1]=\frac{5*D(4)}{5!}, Pr[X=2]=\frac{{5\choose{2}}*D(3)}{5!}, Pr[X=3]=\frac{{5\choose{3}}*D(2)}{5!},Pr[X=5]=\frac{1}{5!},Pr[X=4]=0}.$$
For $Y$ :
$$Pr[Y=0]=\frac{\small\text{number of derangements of the 3 hearts*}|\{\{5\spadesuit,2\clubsuit\},\{2\clubsuit,5\spadesuit\}\}|}{\text{number of permutations}}=\frac{D(3)\cdot2}{5!}$$
For $Pr[Y=1]$ I'm having trouble counting.

A:

To compute the probability distribution for $Y$:
Note:  throughout, $!n$ will denote the number of Derangements on $n$ letters.
$Y=0\quad $  We have three cases, according to how many of the black cards are fixed.  If $0$ black cards are fixed then there are $!5$ ways to do it. If exactly one black card is fixed then there are $!4$ for each of the two ways to choose the fixed black card.  And if both black cards are fixed then there are $!3$.  Thus $$P(Y=0)=\frac {!5+2\times !4+!3}{5!}=\frac 8{15}$$
$Y=1\quad $  There are $3$ ways to choose the fixed Heart.  For a fixed choice, we again have three cases.  If $0$ black cards are fixed then there are $!4$ ways to do it. If exactly one black card is fixed then there are $!3$ ways to do it for each choice of fixed black card, and if both black cards are fixed then there is only $1$ way to do it.  Thus $$P(Y=1)=3\times \frac {!4+2\times 3!+1}{5!}=\frac 7{20}$$
$Y=2\quad$  There are $3$ ways to choose the fixed pair of Hearts.  For a fixed choice, we again have three cases.  If $0$ black cards are fixed then there are $!3$ ways to do it.  If exactly one black card is fixed then there are $!2$ ways to do it for each choice of fixed black card.  If both black cards are fixed then there is no way to do it.  Thus $$P(Y=2)=3\times \frac {!3+2\times !2}{5!}=\frac 1{10}$$
$Y=3\quad$  In this case we either permute the two black cards or we fix them both, so $$P(Y=3)=\frac 2{5!}=\frac 1{60}$$
Sanity checks:  first of all, these must sum to $1$.  Indeed we get $$\frac {32+21+6+1}{60}=1$$
Secondly, it is easy to see that the expected number of fixed hearts is $\frac 35$ (hint: use indicator variables).  And it is easy to confirm that number directly from the probabilities.

So the majority of voters passed prop 30, which is a six-year tax hike, The very same voters passed a prop that taxes California businesses that is supposed to help jump-start the green energy revolution. Yeah, we see how well that worked for D.C.. So here is the bottom line, because I am not going to waste my time hammering the majority in America who are takers, and enablers for, and of the government. Any public union member who voted for a tax hike, did nothing more than cut their pay. That simple. And when businesses, and the minority “makers” and “providers” exit the state, and the lose their jobs, take an additional pay cut, or are forced to take hits to their retirement, they can thank the union’s leadership. I will no longer feel sorry when those who fell for this junk, lose their jobs. Why? Because they chose to be ignorant lambs who went willing to slaughter.. Recent Comments

Electrode catheters have been in common use in medical practice for many years. Diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrythmias by means of electrode catheters include mapping the electrical properties of heart tissue and selectively ablating cardiac tissue by application of energy. Such ablation can cease or modify the propagation of unwanted electrical signals from one portion of the heart to another. The ablation process destroys the unwanted electrical pathways by formation of non-conducting lesions. Various energy delivery modalities have been disclosed for forming lesions, and include use of microwave, laser and more commonly, radiofrequency energies to create conduction blocks along the cardiac tissue wall.
In a two-step procedure—mapping followed by ablation—electrical activity at locations within the heart is typically sensed and measured by advancing a catheter containing one or more electrical sensors (or electrodes) into the heart, and acquiring data at a multiplicity of locations. These data are then utilized to select the tissue target areas at which ablation is to be performed.
In use, the electrode catheter is inserted into a major vein or artery, e.g., the femoral artery, and then guided into a chamber of the heart. A reference electrode is provided, generally taped to the patient's skin or provided on the ablation catheter or another catheter. Radio frequency (RF) current is applied to the ablation electrode of the catheter, and flows through the surrounding media, i.e., blood and tissue, toward the reference electrode. The distribution of current depends on the amount of electrode surface in contact with the tissue, as compared to blood which has a higher conductivity than the tissue.
Heating of the tissue occurs due to its electrical resistivity. The tissue is heated sufficiently to cause cellular destruction in the cardiac tissue resulting in formation of a lesion within the cardiac tissue which is electrically non-conductive. During this process, heating of the ablation electrode also occurs as a result of conduction from the heated tissue to the electrode itself. If the electrode temperature becomes sufficiently high, possibly above 60° C., a thin transparent coating of dehydrated blood can form on the surface of the electrode. If the temperature continues to rise, this dehydrated layer of blood can become progressively thicker resulting in blood coagulation on the electrode surface. Because dehydrated biological material has a higher electrical resistance than tissue, impedance to the flow of electrical energy into the tissue also increases. If the impedance increases sufficiently, an impedance rise occurs and the catheter must be removed from the body and the tip electrode cleaned.
In a typical application of RF current, circulating blood provides some cooling of the ablation electrode. Another method is to irrigate the ablation electrode, e.g., with physiologic saline at room temperature, to actively cool the ablation electrode instead of relying on the more passive physiological cooling provided by the blood. Because the strength of the RF current is no longer limited by the interface temperature, current can be increased. This results in lesions which tend to be larger and more spherical, usually measuring about 10 to 12 mm.
The clinical effectiveness of irrigating the ablation electrode is dependent upon the distribution of flow within the electrode structure and the rate of irrigation flow through the catheter. Effectiveness is achieved by reducing the overall electrode temperature and eliminating hot spots in the ablation electrode which can initiate coagulum formation. More channels and higher flows are more effective in reducing overall temperature and temperature variations, i.e., hot spots. The coolant flow rate must be balanced against the amount of fluid that can be injected into the patient and the increased clinical load required to monitor and possibly refill the injection devices during a procedure. In addition to irrigation flow during ablation, a maintenance flow, typically a lower flow rate, is required throughout the procedure to prevent backflow of blood into the coolant passages. Thus, reducing coolant flow by utilizing it as efficiently as possible is a desirable design objective.
Another consideration is the ability to control the exact position and orientation of the catheter tip. This is ability is critical and largely determines the usefulness of the catheter. It is generally known to incorporate into electrophysiology catheters an electromagnetic (EM) tri-axis location/position sensor for determining the location of a catheter's distal end. An EM sensor in the catheter, typically near the catheter's distal end within the distal tip, gives rise to signals that are used to determine the position of the device relative to a frame of reference that is fixed either externally to the body or to the heart itself. The EM sensor may be active or passive and may operate by generating or receiving electrical, magnetic or ultrasonic energy fields or other suitable forms of energy known in the art.
Where the distal tip is irrigated, fluid loading in the patient becomes a significant factor as ablation procedures can last five or six hours. Conventional irrigated tip electrodes typically operate with a flow rate of about 17 ml/minute at below about 30 watts of RF ablation energy to about 30-50 ml/minute at about 30 watts or greater. Moreover, current catheters include irrigated ring electrodes further increasing the fluid load in the patient. The pericardial space can quickly begin to fill with the irrigation fluid, such as saline, thereby limiting the amount of time the ablation catheter can be in the body and the number of ablations that can be performed due to fluid overload.
Accordingly, it is desirable that a catheter be adapted for removal of excess fluids by suction through fluid evacuation ports near the ablating electrodes.

A comparison of 18-MV and 6-MV treatment plans using 3D dose calculation with and without heterogeneity correction.
Homogeneity of the dose distribution in irradiation of the intact breast for stage I and II cancers is an important factor, particularly for larger breasts. In the present work, we have studied dose homogeneity for 6- and 18-MV treatment plans in 10 patients, typically with larger breasts. For each patient, 6 3-dimensional (3D) dose distributions were calculated using patient computed tomography data and the ADAC Pinnacle3 treatment planning system. First, a dose distribution was calculated, assuming the patient was water, with the 6-MV beam parameters used to treat the patient. Second, the calculation was repeated using the actual patient anatomy. Comparison of these 2 distributions showed how patient heterogeneity affected dose. Third, individual beam weights were optimized, and the dose calculation was repeated. Each of these 3 dose calculations was repeated at 18 MV. Results showed that: (1) at 6 MV, the ratio of mean dose in the target volume calculated with heterogeneity considerations to that without was 1.014 +/- 0.006, and the ratio of the standard deviation of dose in the target volume was 0.919 +/- 0.042; (2) at 18 MV, the ratio of mean dose to the target volume calculated with heterogeneity considerations to that without was 1.001 +/- 0.005, and the ratio of the standard deviation of dose in the target volume was 1.15 +/- 0.09; and (3) the dose homogeneity, measured by the standard deviation of the dose distribution in the target volume, was 25% less for the 18-MV treatment plan for patients with breast volumes greater than 1600 cm3. We conclude that: (1) 3D, heterogeneity-corrected dose calculation is necessary to fairly evaluate any advantage of 18 MV over 6 MV; (2) excluding the dose buildup region, 18 MV produces a significantly more homogeneous dose distribution for breast volumes greater than 1600 cm3; and (3) when prescribing dose using heterogeneity-corrected dose distributions, dose prescriptions should be increased by 1.5% at 6 MV, but no increase is needed for 18 MV.

Excitatory synapses from CA3 pyramidal cells onto neighboring pyramidal cells differ from those onto inhibitory interneurons.
The glutamatergic pyramidal cell (PYR) to pyramidal cell synapse was compared to the PYR to inhibitory interneuron (INT) synapse in area CA3 of rat hippocampal roller-tube cultures. Paired-pulses and tetanic stimulations of a presynaptic PYR were conducted utilizing dual whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of either two PYRs or of a PYR and visually identified stratum oriens INT. Differences in synaptic characteristics were observed, depending on the postsynaptic target cell. Across cell pairs the variation of EPSC amplitudes was much larger for postsynaptic PYRs than for INTs. EPSCs recorded from INTs had faster rise times and shorter decays than those recorded in PYRs. There were also differences in the short-term plasticity of these synapses. Dual PYR:PYR recordings during paired-pulse stimulation at 100 ms interstimulus intervals demonstrated no modulation of EPSC amplitudes, while PYR:INT synapses showed paired-pulse depression. During trains of action potentials, the PYR:PYR EPSCs followed the presynaptic action potential train reliably, with little depression of EPSCs, while PYR:INT EPSCs demonstrated failures of transmission or profound depression after the initial EPSC. These results indicate multiple differences at both the pre- and postsynaptic level in the characteristics of pyramidal cell synapses that depend on the postsynaptic target's identity as either PYR or INT.

“It’s a role Joe would grow into and get better at all the time until he’s a natural,” Young said. “He’s somebody the players would get right behind.

“I think he would be a great choice and would make a great England captain.”

Jones criticised current skipper Chris Robshaw during the World Cup but is planning talks with the 29-year-old, who was made captain by Lancaster in 2012.

Former Cardiff and Wales captain Young was coaching Cardiff Blues when Warren Gatland installed Sam Warburton as Wales captain in 2011 and he sees similarities between the Welsh talisman and Launchbury.

“Both are very sensible, don’t go chasing the limelight, don’t do things that will draw attention: Joe leads from the front, and doesn’t speak for the sake of it,” said Wasps director of rugby Young.

“One of the greatest England captains, Martin Johnson, didn’t speak for the sake of it. When he spoke people listened. I think Joe would be very similar.”

Rare Breeding Tigers Caught on Camera in ThailandEnvironment | March 29, 2017, Wednesday @ 17:45| 66 views. Illustration Photo: YouTube/Print Screen. These images of rarely seen Indochinese tigers in eastern Thailand have excited conservationists.. They’re evidence of only the second breeding population in the world and the first in eastern Thailand in 15 years.. There are believed to be as few as 3,900 Indochinese tigers in the wild, and only 221 in Thailand and Myanmar.. This discovery, captured by hidden cameras, gives conservationists hope for growth of the region’s populations.. Wild cat specialists Panthera are optimistic this group could help repopulate Cambodia and Laos. Senior Tiger Program Director, Dr John Goodrich said he hopes the population could develop into a “tiger stronghold… serving as a source of life and diversity for depleted tiger populations”.. Back

The tekmarNet® thermostat 552 is a communicating touchscreen thermostat designed for hydronic heating systems. The extra large touchscreen display allows you to easily adjust 7-day programmable schedules and room temperatures to optimize comfort and energy savings. It operates a single zone of heating and has two auxiliary sensor inputs that can be assigned to measure room, floor, or outdoor temperature. An optional floor sensor allows precise heating of radiant floors by controlling the floor temperature and maintaining the desired room air temperature. Alternatively the room air temperature sensor can also be disabled to solely maintain a minimum floor temperature. The 552 can be wired using 2 or 4 wires to connect to tekmarNet® zoning controls, or can be installed as a stand-alone thermostat using 3 wires.. Product Submittal. Jul 2011 - Present. 552_C.

Preparation of disodium fluorescein powders in association with lauric and capric acids.
In previous studies micronized disodium fluorescein (DF) powders were coated with lauric or capric acid. This was a precursor to evaluating the effects of the fatty acids on the hygroscopic growth of the DF aerosols. Studies of the association of fatty acids with DF reflected a limited interpretation of the data obtained. The present study examines more closely the phenomena involved in coating the DF. It is concluded that lateral interactions due to the hydrophobic aliphatic tails of the fatty acids give rise to adsorption, aggregation, and flocculation, all of which cause inflections in the association isotherm rendering it nonlinear.

Orthodontic treatment of the primary dentition for patients with clefts of lip, alveolus, and palate following presurgical orthodontics, labioplasty and palatoplasty.
In spite of presurgical orthodontic treatment, after a labio- and palatoplasty in continuous uni- and bilateral clefts of the lip, alveolus bone, and palate, anomalies of the dental arch, occlusion, jaw size and position can appear. This is favoured in cases without adequate retention of the upper dental arch through intercuspidation of the lower dental arch. These anomalies should be treated. The treatment of the malposition of the primary teeth is not of concern, but the termination of the forced sagittal and transverse mandibular displacements and thereby the coordination of the growth of the upper and lower jaw, which depend on each other.

Supramolecularly Engineered Amphiphilic Macromolecules: Molecular Interaction Overrules Packing Parameters.
We report molecular interaction-driven self-assembly of supramolecularly engineered amphiphilic macromolecules (SEAM) containing a single supramolecular structure-directing unit (SSDU) consisting of an H-bonding group connected to a naphthalene diimide chromophore. Two such SEAMs, P1-50 and P2-50, having the identical chemical structure and hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, exhibit distinct self-assembled structures (polymersome and cylindrical micelle, respectively) due to a difference in the H-bonding group (hydrazide or amide, respectively) of the single SSDU. When mixed together, P1-50 and P2-50 adopted self-sorted assembly. For either series of polymers, variation in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance does not alter the morphology reconfirming that self-assembly is primarily driven by directional molecular interaction which is capable of overruling the existing norms in packing parameter-dependent morphology control in an immiscibility-driven block copolymer assembly.

The other is Eversion, which I've recommended before on account of how it's super rad: it's a puzzle platformer through parallel universes, each getting increasingly dark/awesome.

I also noticed they're using a quote from the last time I recommended the game to sell it, which is both sweet and flattering. Hooray!. – Ryan

Posted by Allyn Bulzomi on Apr 20, 2018 Rotary Club of Tucson has sponsored the Amphitheater Interact Club and Rotaract Club of the University of Arizona for the past five years. We have provided financial support as well as advisors to both clubs. We share sponsorship for the UofA Rotaract Club with Sunrise Rotary. Interact and Rotaract are unique in that they only meet during the school year. Meetings tend to start in late August and end in May each year. It is amazing how much these two clubs accomplish every year given the limited time they have. The club structures are basically the same as our club. Each club has a President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, Sergeant at Arms and various directors. Club Elections typically take place during April. Today the clubs will present their Year in Review. I am sure you will all be surprised by how much they accomplish every year.

Puerarin and conjugate bases as radical scavengers and antioxidants: molecular mechanism and synergism with beta-carotene.
The 4'-hydroxyl group of puerarin, a C-glycoside of the isoflavonoid daidzein, was shown, using 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical cation and stopped-flow spectroscopy and by comparison with the 7-propylpuerarin (A ring derivative) and 4'-propylpuerarin (B ring derivative), to be a more efficient radical scavenger as compared to the 7-hydroxyl group by a factor of 2, a difference increasing upon deprotonation. The difference in radical scavenging agreed with the oxidation potentials (cyclic voltammetry in acetonitrile, 0.1 M Bu4NBF4 at 25 degrees C): E/mV=862+/-3 for puerarin, 905+/-10 for 7-propylpuerarin, and 1064+/-2 for 4'-propylpuerarin relative to ferrocene/ferricenium. In aqueous solution, the reduction potential was shown to decrease for increasing pH, and deprotonation of the 4'-hydroxyl group increased radical scavenging more than deprotonation of the 7-hydroxyl group. The 7-hydroxyl was found to be more acidic (pKa1=7.20+/-0.01 in puerarin and pKa=7.23+/-0.01 in 4'-propylpuerarin) than the 4'-hydroxyl group (pKa2=9.84+/-0.08 in puerarin and pKa=9.51+/-0.02 in 7-propylpuerarin); aqueous solution, ionic strength of 0.1, and 25 degrees C. In phosphatidyl choline liposome of pH 7.4, puerarin and beta-carotene each showed a modest antioxidant activity measured as prolongation of the lag phase for formation of conjugate dienes and using the water-soluble radical initiator APPH with effects of puerarin and beta-carotene being additive. For the lipophilic initiator AMVN, the antioxidative effect decreased for puerarin and increased for beta-carotene as compared to APPH and showed a clear synergism. A regeneration of beta-carotene, effective in the liposome lipid phase as antioxidant, from the cation radical by deprotonated forms of puerarin was demonstrated in 9:1 chloroform/methanol using laser flash photolysis with k2=2.7x10(4) L mol-1 s-1 for the bimolecular process between the cation radical and the puerarin dianion.

Dad Podcast

Posted by Jason Kreidman on December 20, 2016 in Podcast with no comments

When you look back at the holidays, what do you remember most? Do you remember the gifts? Do you remember a location you were at or something you did? You remember the celebrations, the activities you did, the people you were around. You create memories. I think I might be able to remember a couple of gits out of all of the years of holidays. And my parents were really generous.

The holidays are typically the time of year when people do spend time together – even when they don’t want to. sometimes they feel like they have to. For many however, it is a wonderful feeling to spend time together. I know I love spending time with my family. I don’t say that because they are listening

While we all can feel the joy of giving and receiving gifts, typically that feeling is short term. When we create memories, they can last forever. We also can take pictures and video to help us remember.

As my wife and I began collecting the thousand of presents delivered from Amazon. Multiple new packages seems to be showing up each day, we recently had a discussion about creating the tradition where we will spend time together (go on a small vacation or getaway with the kids) as their present. While getting some small things may be ok, spending money on “THINGS” seems like such a waste. The kids play with toys for a small amount of time, grow out of their clothes in no time, and simply just have too much stuff. Of course every family is different, but for most

Her and I already agree that for our own birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays we prefer to “do stuff” rather than receive stuff. So we are going to begin introducing this concept to the kids.

Specifically for the holidays, here are 3 ways to give them your presence:

– Give them a coupon book of your time: You could make one. Have the coupon be things like “lunch date”, or “taking a walk together”, things like that. If you have multiple children, the value of them doing this one on one with you is huge.

– Plan a family getaway – whether an overnight, weekend, or week vacation, take the money you were going to spend on presents and book a getaway.

Also as a dad you can think of this in non-holiday terms. Spending time with your kids and being “present” is much more important than getting them presents. Listen to Episode 74 with Presence expert Johnny Blackburn. He provides solid advice on how to be present.

– Secure a regular date with your child – For example, “every Wednesday evening, you and I will spend time together doing something you like. We can play games, color, etc.

These kind of gifts don’t have a price tag. They are priceless. While a 5 or 6 year might say they rather have pokeman cards or a video game, your presence is going to have a much larger impact than pikachu or legos.

Sherlock Holmes Heads Into Reshoots

I’ve gotten to the point that I’m not paying much attention to reports of movies going into reshoots. A couple of weeks ago there was an uproar about reshoots on X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which, it turned out, were just to make up for shots that couldn’t be made before, at least according to the “official story.” It looks like we’ve got a similar situation going on now with Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes, with both a scandalous report on the reshoots and an official studio response within a very brief time.

The original report comes from The Sun… reason enough to doubt some of its legitimacy. The tabloid reported that “Guy Ritchie was fuming” after being ordered by the studio to reshoot several weeks worth of material, requiring the director to call back his stars and make the movie more realistic. The article attributes problems with the production to Ritchie’s recent divorce from Madonna - again, a very scandal-driven approach to reporting the news.

Not surprisingly, Warner Brothers has responded to the allegations through a more trusted source, as reported by Hollywood Reporter. The studio claims the reshoots have always been on the schedule, and there’s not been any reaction to the film being “ridiculously unrealistic” because nobody has seen an actual cut of the picture yet, but that the footage seen so far has been pleasing to both Ritchie and the studio.

Normally I’m the kind of person to doubt some of these official studio press stances, but it is early on in the process for Sherlock Holmes and the initial report isn’t exactly coming from the most reliable source. It sounds like production is still under way on the movie and it’s too early for anyone, including the studio, to formulate an opinion.

Stressful events and depressive symptoms among old women and men: a longitudinal study.
Depression is quite common among the elderly members of Hong Kong Chinese society. This study examined the impact of a series of common stressful life events (SLEs) on changes in depressive symptoms among the older people. The respondents were 260 people aged seventy years or older from a longitudinal study of a representative community sample of the elderly population in Hong Kong. Using multiple regression models, the authors found that, of eight SLEs examined, only widowhood was associated with depressive symptoms three years later, even after controlling sociodemographic, physical health status, and social support variables were applied. In addition, the SLE influenced the depression differently for men and women, as we found that the death of a spouse was associated with increased in depressive symptoms among elder women, and the moving out of children was associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms among old men. Finally, we also found a close relationship between number of SLEs and depression.

(3) What is the range of the theory?. - That is how much of human religious behavior does it claim to explain? All of it? Or just some? And in that light, does it actually do what it claims?.

Distribution and determinants of mutans streptococci among African-American children and association with selected variables.
Prevalence of mutans streptococci (MS) and the effect of selected variables, including the early childhood use of antibiotics on the oral colonization of MS, were studied among 353, 5- to 12-year-old African-American children using a cross-sectional study. MS prevalence was estimated using pooled plaque and stimulated saliva samples (spatula). Data on antibiotic use and other potential determinants of oral colonization of MS were obtained using a self-administered questionnaire. Antibiotic data were validated using health records of subjects. MS prevalence (92%, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 89-95%) was associated with dental caries (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.3-6.2), age (Chi for trend = 4.3, P = 0.04), increased frequency of sweet consumption (Chi for trend = 5.1, P = 0.02), and increased number of teeth in the mouth (unit OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1-1.6). Higher MS levels were associated with higher number of decayed teeth (P < 0.0001), and also, with having the mother as the primary caregiver during the second year of life (P = 0.02). Furthermore, children who took antibiotics during early childhood and those who lived in the same household with many others during the second year of life had a higher MS prevalence than those who did not (OR = 8.3, 95% CI = 2.0-35.0; unit OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.03-2.2, respectively). It is unclear why those exposed to antibiotics during the "window of infectivity" of MS exhibit a higher MS prevalence. Antibiotic-related oral ecological changes (i.e, lower levels of S. sanguis) and environmental changes (i.e., frequent exposure to sugar through most pediatric antibiotic preparations) may make the oral cavity more favorable for initial MS colonization.

Sensory nerve systems translate environmental physical and chemical stimuli into neuronal language and form according sensations. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons are the primary sensory neurons for skin sensation, and it is still unclear how these DRG neurons encode the stimulations on the skin.

The present invenion relates to a new and improved construction of a tread for a pneumatic tire which is of the type comprising two inner ribs extending in the circumferential direction of the tire and, to both sides of said ribs, tiers or block rows likewise extending in the circumferential direction of the tire, the block rows and ribs being separated from one another in each case by a respective zig-zag circumferential groove.
Such type tires are designed for use during winter driving conditions and over relatively rough terrain or land. By providing a rather coarse pattern of the tire profile such tires have improved traction in snow. The snow which is compressed by the pressure of the tire thus forms, within the profile grooves, a particularly highly compacted structure or rib configuration, so that, similar to the transmission of forces between a gear and rack, the engine power of the vehicle is transmitted to the road surface or the like extensively free of loss.
Heretofore known constructions of the previously mentioned type of tire treads possess three identical zig-zag configured circumferential grooves. Since at the region of the tread or contact surface of the tire the tread pressure of passenger vehicle tires acting upon the roadway surface is greater at the shoulder region than at the center of the tread, there arises a different degree of compaction of the snow in the aforementioned circumferential grooves. As a consequence thereof, the traction is reduced, since, as a practical matter, only both of the outer or lateral circumferential grooves are effective.

Actually, I recommend Qt’s own build files as a primary source for qmake information anyway, as if you know where something ought to be in a project then it is faster to find it than going through the formal manual.. In a SUBDIRS project, you may have something like this:. SUBDIRS += library unittest examples.

April 16, 2014. It may come as a shock to some parents and a pleasant surprise to your children.. Recent studies show habitual video game players tend to have much higher levels of visual attention, meaning they're able to notice more things and react more quickly than others.. Dr. David Todd says some doctors use games to help with lazy eyes.. Todd says, "You could potentially use it in sports if you did that type of training with a catcher where he could see all of the bases, a tennis player or an air traffic controller.". However, Todd does not condone endless hours of video games and he advises children to stay away from games with violence and obscenities.

Rate your securities in order to understand their value. Because of the varying degrees of pricing structures that affect the securities market, it is important to have some sort of credit rating system that assesses which securities are performing better than the others.. I am interested in the criteria that are used to assess the credit worthiness of the securities industry and therefore I have come up with a list of factors that might possibly point towards the reasons for the credit rating. This is not an exhaustive list but it explores some of the major issues that will determine how a security is viewed by potential investors.

Adalimumab: an anti-TNF agent for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.
Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) has a central role in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Adalimumab (Humira, Abbott Laboratories) is the first fully human, recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically targets human TNF. Adalimumab blocks the interaction of TNF with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, thereby neutralising the activity of this cytokine. In clinical trials of patients with PsA, adalimumab significantly reduced both joint and skin symptoms. In addition, structural changes were inhibited, and statistically and clinically significant improvements in measures of disability and quality of life were observed. Adalimumab was generally safe and well tolerated.

Complementation, genetic conflict, and
the evolution of sex and recombination

Abstract
The existence of sexual reproduction is difficult to explain because the 2-fold cost of meiosis requires a compensatory 2-fold
advantage that is difficult to prove. Here, I show that asexual reproduction has a short-term disadvantage due to the loss of
complementation of recessive deleterious mutations, which can overcome the 2-fold cost of meiosis in one or few
generations. This complementation hypothesis can also explain why most asexual species are polyploid, why only certain
types of asexual reproduction exist, why meiosis is not one-step, and the origin of amphimixis. I also show that the
promotion of variation by recombination is not necessary to explain the evolution of amphimixis. Instead, recombination
can be the result of an intragenomic conflict between alleles that induce the initiation of crossing over and alleles that evolve
to resist that initiation. Thus recombination does not require any advantage at the individual or population level.
Key words: amphimixis, apomixis, automixis, endomitosis, asexual reproduction, complementation, deleterious mutations, gene conversion,

Just when people were getting excited for the arrival of the GHOST RIDER series on Hulu, that excitement has to be quelled as now the series will no longer be moving forward. This was reported as an exclusive from Deadline.. Deadline is reporting that seemingly the reason for the series not going forward is creative differences between Hulu and the GHOST RIDER team.. Even though Gabriel Luna will not be reprising his role on Hulu as Robbie Reyes, MARVEL’S HELSTROM is on track as well as four connected animated series. MARVEL’S M.O.D.O.K, MARVEL’S HIT-MONKEY, MARVEL’S TIGRA AND DAZZLER SHOW and MARVEL’S HOWARD THE DUCK, set to roll out in 2020, culminating in a special event, MARVEL’s THE OFFENDERS.. It is not yet known if the series will shopped elsewhere but there has been rumors that Marvel Studios is interested in bringing a Ghost Rider show to the Disney plus streaming site.

Congruent Angles. Angles are congruent if they have the same angle measure. Two angles are congruent if they have the same measure in degrees.. Its not necessary for the angles to have same direction or equal segment lengths. But if the congruent angles are laid on top of each other they coincide with each other.. Geometric figures are classified based on the interior angles:. For Example:. Triangles: if all the interior angles of a triangle are congruent them it is called as an equilateral triangle.. Quadrilateral: If all the interior angles of a quadrilateral are congruent then it can be a square or a rectangle depending on the length of its sides.. Polygon: A polygon with all congruent interior angles is called as a regular polygon.. Here are some examples of congruent interior angles..

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and TNG Chief Joe Alphonse ride to the meeting place Friday at Xeni Gwet’in where Trudeau exonerated six hanged war chiefs of 1864 before Tsilhqot’in members. Angie Mindus photos

About two hundred Tsilhqot’ins gathered in the Nemiah Valley Friday to witness Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau personally apology and exonerate six of the Nation’s war chiefs who were hanged in 1864.

It was a picturesque scene at about 1 p.m. when Trudeau and Chief Joe Alphonse, TNG chairman, galloped into the grassy area flanked by snow-capped mountains to start the historic meeting.

Following speeches by the current Tsilhqot’in chiefs, Trudeau took to the microphone, stating he recognized that the war chiefs were only protecting their nation which was under threat by another at the time when they were lured to a meeting in Quesnel by colonial officials for peace talks and were instead arrested, tried and hanged.

“Those were mistakes that our government profoundly regrets and is determined to set right,” Trudeau said.

“The treatment of the Tsilhqot’in chiefs represents a betrayal of trust, an injustice that you have carried for more than 150 years.”

The chiefs that perished on Oct. 26, 1864 near Quesnel were Head War Chief Lhats’as?in (Lhas-awss-een); Chief Biyil (pe-yal); Chief Tellot (tay-lot); Chief Tahpitt (ta-peet); Chief Chayses (chay-sus); and Chief Ahan (a-han) who was hanged in New Westminister in 1865.

Those who took part in the day Friday said they felt happy about the exoneration from Canada, but also sad that their war chiefs had to give their lives to protect their lands. He said they hoped now they rest in peace.

Chief Joe Alphonse said the meeting on traditional lands was an enjoyable, relaxing experience for him compared to going to Ottawa in March to the House of Commons where Trudeau first formally exonerated the war chiefs.

He said he was very pleased that the Prime Minister accepted the invitation to come to the title lands so that the TNG members could hear for themselves the exoneration.

Xeni Gwet’in Chief Jimmy Lulua thanked Trudeau for coming to title lands and said he was proud of his Tsilhqot’in people.

“I’m so excited to keep moving forward and it’s an honour and I thank Justin Trudeau for being the first prime minister to come to title lands and to set history right.”

Chief Russell Myers Ross said he hoped the apology would allow for meaningful government-to-government work moving forward.

After the formal apology and exoneration, the Nation presented Trudeau with a special gift — a replica of the buckskin jacket given to his father which was made at that time by Tsilhqot’in member Julie Gilpin. Julie was on hand to present the new jacket, made by her daughter Denise Gilpin, to Trudeau.

“It fits perfect,” Trudeau said, smiling and noting all his dad’s jackets were small for him.

Trudeau then made his way into the crowd to greet as many people as he could before making the long journey back to Williams Lake by vehicle, the same way he came in, and flying out of the airport there.

Payel Laceese, a grandson to Julie and son to Denise, said he hoped the meeting would bring healing.

“Our people can let that go without there being that grudge,” he said, adding he felt there was a special connection with Trudeau, due to the history with the jacket.

“It’s not just a nation-to-nation relationship, it’s family-to-family.”

Former Xeni Gwet’in chief Annie Williams also thought the meeting was exceptional.

“It’s hard to believe he was here,” she said as the convoy pulled away. “It felt like he was one of us.”

Q:

Dealing with long lists of number in pygame

I am just learning python and have started making a game using pygame.
In my game I have a list that contains all of the obstacles that the player must over come in each of the levels. Although this list quickly became very big and has started to take up many lines of my project. 
I was wondering if I should have a dedicated text file that contains this list and import it into my project or if there is a better way of doing this. I know this is a kind of vague questions but I was just wondering if importing a long list into my project could be a good way about going with this problem.
I really hope someone knows what to do because I am not quite sure and I would really appreciate someone else's opinion on the matter.

A:

I guess it depends on how many obstacles you got or if you want it to look neat and tidy then yeah. if your not doing obstacles = [obstacle(100,100,24,50), obstacle(100,100,24,50), obstacle(100,100,24,50), obstacle(100,100,24,50), obstacle(100,100,24,50)...] then do that and see if it still looks like a lot. its no better or worse. Completely up to you



Matmos’ extensive back catalogue is a wonderfully weird library of high concept experimental electronica, including such touchstones as 2001’s A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure. Over a career stretching over 20 years, they’ve radically reimagined everyone from John Phillip Sousa to the Buzzcocks and taken cues from a myriad of genres like ambient, drone, krautrock and noise. They now roll into Ochiai together with hardcore digitalist Jeff Carey – this one should make for an appropriately energetic start to the weekend.

British actor Roy Dotrice, who narrated the A Song of Ice and Fire audiobooks and appeared as Pyromancer Hallyne in two episodes of Season 2 of Game of Thrones, died today at age 94, according to the BBC. Thrones was Dotrice’s last television role before his death.

Dotrice — a multifaceted actor who had roles in film, television and theater, winning a Tony Award in 2000 for the Broadway revival of A Moon for the Misbegotten — earned a Guinness World Record for the most characters ever voiced by a single actor when recording the audiobook for “A Game of Thrones” in 2004, and went on to narrate all of the published novels in George R.R. Martin‘s A Song of Ice and Fire series. He was originally cast as Grand Maester Pycelle in 2010, but he fell ill before filming began and instead appeared in two episodes of Season 2 as Pyromancer Hallyne — who, viewers recall, gleefully watched his wildfire oblierate Stannis Baratheon’s fleet during the Battle of the Blackwater.

Dotrice and Martin had a long-running relationship, beginning with their work together on the television series Beauty and the Beast, which ran from 1987-90 and on which Dotrice played Jacob “Father” Wells and Martin was a writer and producer. It was because of that long relationship that Dotrice reportedly accepted the cameo as Hallyne after recovering from his illness as a favor to Martin. Dotrice will be missed as a longtime member of the Thrones world, especially when “The Winds of Winter” is (finally) published and someone will have to take up the mantle of narrator. We know those will be big shoes to fill.

Rest in peace, Roy.

Q:

Why does Heroku log using the server time rather than the Rails time zone?

UPDATE: Ok, I didn't formulate a good Q to be answered. I still struggle with heroku being on -07:00 UTC and I at +02:00 UTC.
Q: How do I get the log written in the correct Time.zone ? 
The 9 hours difference, heroku (us west) - norway, is distracting to work with. I get this in my production.log (using heroku logs):

Processing ProductionController#create to xml (for 81.26.51.35 at 2010-04-28 23:00:12) [POST]

How do I get it to write 2010-04-29 08:00:12 +02:00 GMT ?
Note that I'm running at heroku and cannot set the server time myself, as one could do at your amazon EC2 servers. Below is my previous question, I'll leave it be as it holds some interesting information about time and zones.

Why does Time.now yield the server local time when I have set the another time zone in my environment.rb
config.time_zone = 'Copenhagen'

I've put this in a view
<p> Time.zone <%= Time.zone %> </p>
<p> Time.now <%= Time.now %> </p>
<p> Time.now.utc <%= Time.now.utc %> </p>
<p> Time.zone.now <%= Time.zone.now %>  </p>
<p> Time.zone.today <%= Time.zone.today %> </p>

rendering this result on my app at heroku 

Time.zone (GMT+01:00) Copenhagen
Time.now Mon Apr 26 08:28:21 -0700
  2010
Time.now.utc Mon Apr 26 15:28:21 UTC
  2010
Time.zone.now 2010-04-26 17:28:21
  +0200
Time.zone.today 2010-04-26

Time.zone.now yields the correct result. Do I have to switch from Time.now to Time.zone.now, everywhere? Seems cumbersome. I truly don't care what the local time of the server is, it's giving me loads of trouble due to extensive use of Time.now. Am I misunderstanding anything fundamental here?

. 1 comment:. People confuse the meaning of work life balance.. Really this is all about control over your work life mix.. Often people start their own business to find to regain that sense of control and find that their new passion has them working more but it is work they want to do when and how they want to do it.. Being able to step out with your wife for breakfast and making up for the work that needs to be done one evening when she is reading in the background etc.... Work life balance is re-inventing yourself and becoming the architect of your own future and not being a slave to someone else's agenda.. Rob Wise. Wise Recruitment.. Australia

In the semiconductor, medical, surgical, robotics and precision machinery industries, components must sometimes be sized to the smallest dimensions possible to meet demanding performance criteria. When bearing sizes range from 1 to 25mm, load capacity and maintenance can become more of an issue than in larger units.. In a new white paper, IKO addresses some of the most important considerations you should keep in mind when specifying miniature bearings.

Effective interaction of nonuniformly charged colloid spheres in a bulk electrolyte.
The interaction energy between two like-charged colloid spheres with nonuniformly distributed surface charges immersed in a bulk electrolyte is calculated under the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The calculated results are sensitive to the relative orientations of the spheres due to the anisotropy of the distribution of charges on the sphere surface. The effective repulsive interaction after thermal average is weaker than the case when charges are uniformly distributed on the spheres, and with the increase of the nonuniformity, an attractive interaction between the two spheres emerges.

Warriors assistant Luke Walton has already interviewed for head coaching positions with the Knicks and Nets, reports Marc Berman of The New York Post. Walton pulled his name out of consideration with Brooklyn, which announced the hiring of Kenny Atkinson earlier today. Golden State is reportedly allowing Walton to talk to other franchises as long as there’s no conflict with its playoff schedule. A source told Berman that Walton may decide to remain with the Warriors for another season.

The video controversy involving D’Angelo Russell and Nick Young may have brought bad publicity to the Lakers, but GM Mitch Kupchak doesn’t believe it will scare off any free agents, writes Baxter Holmes of ESPN.com. Kupchak said the incident “becomes less and less of a story” every day, and he complimented both players on the way they handled it. “We’ve dealt with players in this organization, on this team, that have made mistakes over the years,” Kupchak said, “and we’ve gotten through it and had great teams and won championships.” He believes Young and Russell can settle their differences if they are teammates again next year. However, the Lakers are rumored to want to part ways with Young, either through a trade or buyout. He still has two years and more than $11.1MM left on his contract.

UNLV has hired Marvin Menzies as its new head coach, passing on ex-Kings coach George Karl, according to Jeff Goodman of ESPN.com. Menzies, who had been coaching at New Mexico State, replaces Chris Beard, who backed out of the UNLV job to go to Texas Tech instead. Karl had contacted UNLV about the opening and mutual interest was reported Friday.

The opt-out clause that the Kings included in Seth Curry‘s contract could help him land a much better deal, writes Jason Jones of The Sacramento Bee. After an impressive summer-league performance, Sacramento signed Curry last July, giving him a two-year deal with a $1,015,696 player option for next season that he has to decide on this week. Curry’s performance over the second half of the season may cause someone to pay him a lot more, as he averaged more than 11 points per game after the All-Star break. “I think I’ve played pretty well and showed some different things in my game that will set me up for the future to show I can be a good player in this league for a long time,” Curry said.

There are a lot of patriotic students at Vista Del Lago High School in Folsom, California. So you can imagine their shock when they were warned that chanting “USA” at sporting events and pep rallies could appear to be inappropriate and intolerant.

Television station CBS 13 in Sacramento reports that school leaders feared the chants could come across as intolerant and offensive to some.

“We can communicate an unintended message,” the school’s principal wrote in a letter to parents.

What would the unintended message be – that young people still love the red, white and blue – that they want to make America great again?

Folsom Cordova Unified Communications Director Daniel Thigpen told the television station they have not banned the chant. They just want young people to be more considerate when they chant.

“To practice empathy, to practice kindness and to practice patriotism – you can do both,” Thigpen said.

The school’s principal suggested there are appropriate times to chant – like following the national anthem or the Pledge of Allegiance.

“I think it's really sad that chanting USA in our country has even become a negative thing,” one parent told the television station.

The California Interscholastic Federation notified school districts across the state about concerns the “USA” chant might be used in a derogatory manner.

But that does not appear to be the case at Vista Del Lago High School.

“To say USA, you know, we’re all the same,” student Ryan Bernal told the television station. “We’re all American. It doesn’t matter what your skin tone is or where you’re from.”

That young man has more common sense that most of the grownups in charge of the school district.

“We’re all one,” Ryan said. “We all stand as one together.”

It should be stressed that there’s never been a complaint about the “USA” chants – not one.

The only people expressing angst about public demonstrations of America pride are school staffers.

Perhaps the school district should be more concerned about the unintended message that sends.

Subtotal:. $0.00. The order subtotal is less than the minimum allowed value ($29.00). Norway Spruce,2 year old, 6-12" seedlings. 11 best time to plant bare root nursery stock is in the spring. This gives the trees an entire growing season to become established in their new soil home. When planting a windbreak, we suggest a minimum of 2 staggered rows, but preferably 3 rows if you have enough space. At maturity, the Norway Spruce may reach a 30-40' spread. Taking this into account, you may plant the Norway Spruce trees 15-20' apart. Plant the second row 15-20' away from the first row. Place the trees centered between the trees of the first row in your newly established second planting row. Plant the third row 15-20' from the second row. The trees will line up with the first row of trees. There you have staggered rows!.

Road signs that can detect when a mobile phone is being used in a moving vehicle are being installed in Norfolk. The system, which is being installed in a bid to crack down on mobile phone usage behind the wheel, can tell when an active phone call is being made and flash up a red warning signal to drivers when it detects a call.. It is able to detect bluetooth signals so that anyone who is legally using hands-free calling will not be wrongly issued a warning.. The technology cannot log number plates or be used to catch offenders yet, but these advancements are being considered for the future and it is hoped the current system will act as a deterrent.. It is the first system of its kind to be used on roads in the UK and was developed by warning sign specialists Westcotec along with Norfolk County Council’s road safety team

Street Style: New York Dresses for Mixed Temperatures. New York is in the thick of layering season, meaning it’s no longer advisable to leave home without your turtleneck, scarf, and beanie, and yet tomorrow might have a high of 60. While for some, the arrival of cold weather is an all-too-welcome excuse to stay in and hibernate, for the heartier — and fashion-obsessed — it’s a chance to break out their coziest, chicest garments, from bathrobe coats to calf-length cardigans. We sent photographer Alexandra Gavillet out on the street to shoot New Yorkers’ cold-weather style, which included a tapestrylike, floral velvet overcoat, a bright-red, vintage L.L. Bean windbreaker, and everything in between. Off-duty models paired track pants and Adidas sneakers with classic peacoats, while others opted for leather biker jackets with Ray Bans and blanket scarves. The more playful sported orange leather gloves, bright-green mohair, and a Féline beanie. Click through the slideshow for all these looks and more..

A printed circuit board (PCB) is formed by printing a circuit pattern on an electric insulating substrate with a conductive material, and refers to a circuit board which is configured such that positions for mounting each component are determined, and circuit line for connecting the components is printed on and is fixed to the surface of a flat board, thereby enabling many kinds of electronic components to be densely mounted on the flat board.
Meanwhile, an embedded printed circuit board (PCB) is a printed circuit board in which passive components, such as a resistor, a capacitor, and an inductor, are embedded in a substrate. Technologies for mounting negative components, such as an integrated circuit (IC) chip, have been also developed. In terms of this fact, regardless of the kind of mounted components, the embedded printed circuit board (PCB) has been used as a term called a printed circuit board in which electronic components are embedded.
With regard to a technology for a printed circuit board, in order to embed electronic components, a method of mounting the components, a cavity processing method, a method of connecting the electrode of a chip and a PCB circuit, and the like are very important.
Also, as the number of components embedded in the printed circuit board has been increased, and each thickness of components has been increased, a thickness of the printed circuit board has been also increased. Thus, the development of a technology for reducing a thickness of the printed circuit board has been needed.

Product Releases. Orthopedic Surgical Drapes. Wed, 03/12/2008 - 9:42am. The Tiburon HD is a revolutionary premium surgical drape fabric, designed specifically for orthopedic procedures. This fabric has the same unique benefits of Cardinal Health’s Tiburon surgical drape fabric, including an absorbent top layer, full impervious barrier to fluids or viruses, abrasion resistant, puncture resistant and low linting. It also offers superior resistance to tear and puncture damage and increased absorbency. By using a drape with superior resistance to tear and puncture damage, the number of drapes that are used to layer to prevent drape damage sustained during the rigors of orthopedic surgery can be reduced. Also, a drape with enhanced absorptive properties will reduce the amount of fluid that ends up on the floor, potentially resulting in reduced slip risk, less fluid on clinician scrubs and shoes, and faster OR turnover..

Kathy Griffin’s imaginary execution of President Donald Trump was “only a joke” but the fear it incited in 11-year-old Barron Trump was anything but funny. As both sides of the aisle condemn Griffin’s actions, this incident serves as a reminder that political violence cannot be accepted — for, in order for liberty to prosper, it becomes a civil duty to reject it when it is popularized in this manner.

Although it might incite a Secret Service investigation, Griffin’s joking beheading of President Trump was likely not illegal. It is well within her First Amendment rights to make such an offensive joke. But her freedoms should not allow society to socially embrace this action, as the implications of political violence are far too great — and dangerous.

Throughout history it is clear that when society begins to accept violence against political opponents as the norm, not just rejecting others opinions but their lives entirely, undemocratic regimes are easily able to gain control.

During the French Revolution, political violence was seen as a necessity to dismantle oppressive power structures, but consistently, rulers attaining power through violent means were subject to the same violence.

As historian David Andress explained at the a keynote to the conference, ‘Living in Violent Times’, University of Warwick in 2013, “The revolutionaries of the 1790s were convinced that they were working against violence. Even Jean-Paul Marat, the journalist whose unambiguous calls for the execution of traitors alienated almost every other political leader, always framed those calls in the context of an active threat of counter-revolution, plotting to restore tyranny by force, and as a prophylactic against greater massacre — hundreds of heads should fall, to save tens of thousands.”

British philosopher, Edmund Burke, theorized in 1790 that the reckless revolution in France would ultimately lead to tyranny. France experienced over a decade of public rioting, political executions, and popular discontent. The country did not have a stable leader until 1799 when a military coup d’etat abolished the executive leaders appointed by parliament and thrust Napoleon Bonaparte into power.

Thus, through the normalization of political violence, France allowed unfettered freedom to dehumanize opposition parties and thus experienced a tumble of increasingly radicalized leaders.As Burke warned, “what is liberty without wisdom, and without virtue? It is the greatest of all possible evils; for it is folly, vice, and madness, without tuition or restraint.”

In a more recent example of normalized political violence, the Russian Revolution, Mao’s Cultural Revolution and even the Roman civil wars of antiquity all stand out as other prominent, historical examples of how the destruction of political opponents ultimately resulted in tyranny.

The German and Italian fascists of the early 20th century dehumanized their enemy as well. Germany experienced a period of increased political violence from 1918 to 1933, when the public was left discontent after the first World War. In a similar effort to promote revolution in the nation, German citizens began attacking opposition leaders and holding political rallies that nearly always broke out into violent brawls. The result was eventually a banning of all opposition political parties and the establishment of a Nazi totalitarian state.

In Italy, Fascist violence was used to break the threat of socialism. “Blackshirts” traveled to small towns throughout the Italy and forced political opponents to drink castor oil, before stripping them naked and beating them.

This political violence was justified because the opponent’s ideas made them less than human and therefore, able to be destroyed. Micheal Ebner of Slate Media notes, “Through illegal violence, rather than elections, Fascists controlled government administration and destroyed the offices, newspapers, and cultural and social organizations of the Socialists, trade unions, and peasant leagues. Mussolini occasionally decried the illegal activities…but they operated as the motor that drove his government along the road to dictatorship.”

Even in our own country nearly 100 years later, we must remember the threat of such revolutionary violence.

The most prominent current example is inherent in the Islamist, terrorist message in the United States, following the 2009 shooting at Fort Hood, domestic terrorist Nidal Malik Hasan requested to be a full citizen of the terrorist organization Islamic State, claiming he believed in the establishment of a Muslim caliphate government ruled by fundamentalists.

This sentiment has been mirrored from the Orlando Pulse Night Club shooting to San Bernardino, violence to pursue a political objective is alive and well in the United States. As radical jihadists pursue their own political agenda, American lives are increasingly being placed at risk.

These may seem like extreme examples, but similar sentiment is seeping into the political mainstream. Just this past April, a clash between pro-Trump and anti-Trump protestors led to 21 arrests, 11 injuries, and seven hospital transports for students at Berkley University. A political rally, that quickly turned to political violence — and serve as a warning that it can always get worse.

Kathy Griffin has been fired from CNN and publicly apologized, but her statement calling for the beheading of President Trump was not merely deplorable — it represents a threat to liberty and the constitutional rule of law.

So far, in most domestic cases of political violence public authorities have responded adequately. But as a civil society we must remember that Griffin’s act is not a joke when public beheadings are a trend for Islamic State already overseas.

Area: 7.9 hectares.. Description and Reasons for Notification:. This is one of three networks of cave passages in separate limestone outcrops around Buckfastleigh. Detailed study has shown that the three networks developed over the same time-span during the late Pleistocene period of Geological history about 150,000 years ago. Furthermore, stages in the development of the caves can be related to stages in the development of the valley of the River Dart. Accumulations of debris washed into the caves during their formation contain important fossil remains which give indication of the age of the caves. The caves also contain important and spectacular mineral deposits.. Pridhamsleigh Caves are important as a site for the endemic crustacean Niphargus glennei which is abundant in the cave waters. This animal is thought to be a pre-glacial relict.

Apolipoprotein (apo) E is a genetically polymorphic protein with three common isoforms in humans. We have identified a kindred with a mutant apoE, apoE-1Harrisburg, in which individuals heterozygous for this mutant allele have type III HLP. The mutation is a lysine to glutamic acid substitution at A.A. 146. This mutation results in a decreased fractional catabolic rate for apoE a presumably for apoB containing lipoprotein remnants resulting in type III HLP. The kinetics of metabolism of mutant forms of apoA-I have been investigated. Individuals with apoA-Milano (M) have low levels of apoA-I and HDL. ApoA-IM, which can form disulfide linked dimers, has a very complex metabolic pathway with rapid catabolism of monomeric apoA-IM that also results in rapid catabolism of normal apoA-I, and slow catabolism of apoA-IM dimers. This results in low plasma apoA-I and HDL levels with approximately equal amounts of apoA-IM and normal apoA-I in these heterozygotes. ApoA-IBaltimore (B) subjects have low HDL level with premature atherosclerosis. ApoA-IB is catabolized at a normal rate in a normal subject while both apoA-IB and normal apoA-I are catabolized at an increased rate in apoA-IB subjects. Therefore, the low HDL levels in the apoA-IB subjects are due either to a generalized upregulation of the apoA- I catabolic pathway by apoA-IB or to apoA-IB being a marker for a closely linked gene that upregulates the catabolism of apoA-I and HDL. Kinetic studies of apolipoprotein metabolism have been performed in three normal subjects utilizing nonradioactive heavy isotope labeled amino acids administered by bolus injection. There were no alterations in the metabolism of simultaneously administered radiolabeled apoA-I and apoB, and the catabolic rat, of nonradioactive heavy isotope labeled apoA-I, apoE, as well as VLDL, IDL, and LDL apoB were similar to results for radiolabeled studies of these apolipoproteins. This will be a useful new method to perform metabolic studies of apolipoproteins in humans.

Wonderful book …

Science, religion, archeology and anthropology come together in this well woven tale of a discovery that becomes much more significant than anyone could have expected. The book is a scientific thriller, with a nice touch of romance and humor. What you read below are some of the comments I made as I read. May they do this wonderful book justice. When you read the story, you may or may not agree with me. That is also a pleasure of reading.

• “The subject matter is very interesting and well described without causing confusion due to too much information being given at one time. I did not realize that henge are separated into above, partially above and completely covered sections. I have already learned something, which is why I love reading.”

• “I am enjoying the pace. It is not so slow as to drag and not so fast that I feel rushed and like I haven’t absorbed something important that will make a difference later.”

• A character says to his colleague, “And now let me ask you one last profound question: do you follow the dove or the raven?” “My personal answer is: I love birds especially mourning doves and crows/ravens. Mourning doves are so beautiful, but rather stupid and unaware of their surroundings until it’s usually too late. Crows are very intelligent and aware of their environment at all times. They are hard to trick or get close to, not so with doves. If I had to choose based solely on the bird itself, I would choose to be a Raven. Rather beautiful and intelligent than beautiful and clueless.”

• “I know things are not exactly as they seem. There is an underlying tension that you’ve created around this dig, which is keeping me slightly on edge and wondering when the next oversized boot is going to drop.”

• “I find that part especially fascinating. It would be expected if it were mummified, wet or dry, but it’s a skeleton and not a mummy. I can’t wait to see what this significant tidbit reveals. (removed spoiler)”

• “Dang! He should have at least scared the little prat (I love that word!)”

• “That neighbor is something else. I have to smile at his ‘imminent domain my ass’ attitude.”

• “I want to stand up and applaud, whistle and cheer! Perfectly said! Love this – pure Mallory at her very best!”

• “I like Sir Henry! He knows a gem when he sees one. Take that, Paisley, old girl!”

Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute in Pittsburgh, Pa, reported that they have found the first marker for bladder cancer.. The marker, called BLCA-4, is a tissue matrix protein found inside the nucleus of bladder cancer cells. The researchers said they detected BLCA-4 in 75% of bladder cancer samples studied, in 100% of noncancerous tissue from bladders that contained tumors, and in none of normal bladders from organ donors.. "Our results indicate that BLCA-4 appears in tissue before it becomes cancerous," said Robert Getzenberg, PhD, director of basic research at the institute's Prostate and Urologic Cancer Center. Because the marker is easily isolated from the urine, Getzenberg said BLCA-4 detection is an easy, effective method of finding people who are at risk of bladder cancer or have an early stage.

I normally do not do this kind of stuff. Or even if I do I will most probably not posting it. Except it’s the day when I’m so tired and I need but couldn’t sleep. Which I believe it’s due to THE big project I’ve been working on. It was like my brain has its own mouth, yelling around and wouldn’t shut up. And since I got this IT Project Management book next to me. So, I did it. And the result was a bit weird, as expected.

A brief conversation with Carlos Martinez

A little bit of this made it into my story on the Futures Game that will go up on Cardinals.com later today. But in addition, here’s a writeup of my brief chat with Carlos Martinez on the field this morning.

The excellent Jesse Sanchez served as interpreter.

MLB.com: How has your first year in the U.S. gone so far?

Martinez: It’s been my goal to make it to the United States and pitch here, and I’m very grateful the Cardinals gave me that opportunity to do that. So I’m just here working as hard as I can, doing my work, proving to them that I’m worth it.

MLB.com: Whether in baseball or off the field, what’s been the hardest adjustment for you so far?

Martinez: The biggest thing for me was the language. You come here and you don’t know what’s going on, what all the people are saying. I’ve just been able to concentrate on baseball, concentrate on doing my job and really focus on the game.

MLB.com: Many Cardinals fans are already looking forward to seeing you and Shelby Miller pitching together. Have you given than any thought at all?

Martinez: It would be an honor to pitch in a rotation with a guy like Shelby Miller. But right now, I’m really just focusing on doing the work, and maybe that will come in the future. We really need to concentrate on what we’re doing now.

MLB.com: What’s the biggest thing you’re working on as far as your pitching right now?

Martinez: Right now I’ve really been working on my changeup. It’s a pitch that’s really helped me in Davenport. It’s helping me now. And it’s something I’m really focusing on. I know it’s going to help me in the future.

WASHINGTON (AFP, NYTIMES) - US President Donald Trump on Thursday (March 23) authorised the suspension of controversial tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from key trade partners including the European Union.

But in a twist, the administration might impose import quotas to prevent too much foreign metal from flooding into the United States.

"The tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the following countries are suspended until May 1, 2018," the White House said in a statement, listing EU members states, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea.

"Each of these countries has an important security relationship with the United States," a proclamation from Trump announcing the steel decision said.

The US is in discussions with the countries "on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of steel articles," and tariffs on steel imports from the trade partners will be exempt for now, it said.

US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer had told a Senate committee earlier in the day that the tariff suspension had been authorised by Trump.

"The idea that the president has is that, based on a certain set of criteria, that some countries should get out," Lighthizer said in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee.

Related Story Donald Trump signs order on metal tariffs but Canada, Mexico get reprieve

Trump signed the tariffs - 25 per cent on imported steel and 10 per cent on imported aluminum - earlier this month, drawing condemnation from allies and sparking fears of a trade war.

Many countries, including the EU, warned the White House that they would retaliate forcefully if they are faced with tariffs on metals products.

The Trump administration has stressed that the primary target is China, which has long had massive overproduction that has impacted the global market for steel and aluminum.

The exemptions would provide a reprieve to top trading partners, but a person familiar with the administration's thinking cautioned that the United States is likely to impose quotas on the overall level of metals sent into the United States.

Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser to Trump, confirmed in a television appearance on Thursday that the White House would impose quotas.

"Every country that is not facing tariffs that we're going to negotiate with will face quotas so that we protect our aluminum and steel industries. For all countries, there has to be a quota," Navarro said on CNN.

"If you don't put a quota on, then any country that can do whatever they want will become a transshipment point for every other country."

Perspectives of an international education initiative in children's palliative care.
Education is viewed as central to improving future palliative care for children and families across all countries. International education initiatives will ensure practitioners are aware of global health issues and can provide culturally sensitive care. Creative and innovative means of meeting such directives are required to achieve meaningful student learning. This paper focuses on one innovation, a children's palliative care workshop using case studies as a teaching method, with nursing students from the USA and nursing and midwifery students from the UK. Key learning points arising from student evaluation were recorded under three main themes, these were: differences across countries, similarities across countries, and making learning fun and memorable. Findings indicated that this joint learning activity was viewed positively by all students and has enabled them to learn with and from each other, potentially impacting on their future practice.

I Witnessed a Miracle: Hope for Mothers of Breech Babies

Life is a miracle. Chiropractic can help promote health from the very start! (Photo credit: Tampa Band Photos)

honor of helping others to keep living life to the fullest through living healthful lifestyles. From time to time I also get to witness miracles when Chiropractic takes on challenges which baffle conventional medicine.

Just a little while ago a colleague of mine became a patient when she found her baby was breech in the last few weeks of pregnancy. Unfortunately, mothers in the same situation often consider C-section to be their only choice and plan a scheduled delivery. Others would nervously sign up for painful, risky, and invasive manual turning which is not always successful. My colleague, Dr. Mellas, came to me instead.

There is a non-invasive Chiropractic technique developed by Dr. Larry Webster, D.C. of the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association designed to relax the uterus and promote a baby’s natural turning. After I applied this technique, which reduced stress on the pelvis and associated ligaments, Dr. Mellas’ baby turned to the optimal birthing position. She was able to have a natural birth with no complications and, just a little while later, I received the glowing reports of a happy new mother with her beautiful, healthy, newborn baby.

You can watch my interview with Dr. Mellas here:

The local paper, the Basking Ridge Patch, took an interest in the Webster technique and the success we’ve had. You can read their article here.

David Brunori mentioned in article “Dems Could Have Kept SALT In TCJA, Senate Counsel Says”Law360 02/21/18. Below is an excerpt:. Coughlan said that until President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, P.L. 115-97, on Dec. 22, the state and local tax deduction had survived all previous attempts to eliminate or weaken it. In the 1986 tax overhaul signed by President Ronald Reagan, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, played an active role when it came to SALT then, Coughlan said.. “He made sure, by and large, to preserve it,” said Coughlan, who spoke about the effect of the federal law on state taxes with two practitioners, David Brunori of Quarles & Brady LLP, who is also a professor at George Washington University, and Jamie Yesnowitz of Grant Thornton LLP.

Nanjing Fuxing metro station

Nanjing Fuxing () is a metro station in Taipei, Taiwan served by Taipei Metro. Formerly Nanjing (or Nanking) East Road (from 1996 until 2014), it was renamed on 15 November 2014 to avoid confusion since Green line runs almost entirely under Nanjing East Road.

Station overview
The station is located at the intersection of Fuxing North Rd. and Nanjing East Rd. It has two side platforms (Brown Line), one island platform (Green Line), and eight exits. All platforms are equipped with platform screen doors, three of them are wheelchair-accessible. This station connects to Taipei Arena, China Airlines Headquarters, Taipei Cultural Center and Taipei Municipal Stadium.

The Green Line station is a three-level, underground station underneath Nanjing East Rd. Excavation depth is 25 meters, while the station is 240 meters long and 22 meters wide. Seven additional exits has been added along with the completion of Green Line.

Regression of carotid atherosclerosis by control of morning blood pressure peak in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients.
Morning blood pressure (BP) peak may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Whether morning BP should be a target of hypertension treatment is not known. We investigated the relationship between morning BP variations, carotid internal-medial thickness (CIMT), circulating inflammatory markers, and sympathetic activity in hypertensive patients with different patterns of morning BP increase at baseline and after antihypertensive treatment. One hundred twenty-eight hypertensive patients with morning BP peak (MP+) were compared with 196 hypertensive patients without morning BP peak (MP-). All patients performed 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, assessment of CIMT, circulating concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-18 (IL-18), and urinary catecholamines. Compared with MP- patients, MP+ patients had higher CIMT and urinary catecholamine output (P < .001), as well as CRP, IL-6, and IL-18 (P < .001). We randomly assigned 128 drug-naive MP+ patients to either metoprolol or carvedilol, two antihypertensive drugs with different effects on sympathetic activity. The primary outcome was change in CIMT and circulating inflammatory markers at 12 months. Morning BP decreased more among patients in the carvedilol group (P < .001), whereas clinic BP showed a similar decrease in both groups. The CIMT (P < .001), IL-6 (P < .001), IL-18 (P < .001), and CRP (P < .001) decreased more in the carvedilol group than in the metoprolol group. The CIMT regression was observed in 49% of patients in the carvedilol group and 18% of patients in the metoprolol group (P < .01). Reduction in CIMT was directly associated with changes in morning BP. Higher CIMT and circulating inflammatory markers coexist in hypertensive patients with morning BP peak, and might contribute to their increased cardiovascular risk. Carotid atherosclerosis can be prevented by control of morning BP.

Abstract. The Home Heating Energy Index (HHEI), a tool for measuring energy efficiency, which integrates house size, seasonal temperature variations, and type of heating fuel, was found to be an effective measure. Using 5‐year longitudinal field study data from 24 families living in a cold climate, the tool explained 77% of family energy consumption and provided a definitive benchmark for evaluating home heating energy conservation. Factors which influenced family energy consumption and/or efficiency were: (1) family energy management behaviours, including no‐dollar cost behavioural changes and enhancing the energy efficiency of some mechanical system; (2) housing factors, including structural characteristics and size of house; and, (3) family contextual factors, including socio‐economic status, family size and stage of family life cycle.

In terms of survivability which non-Eddie character is the best all around healer? I have troopers with pharaoh dogs and their healing/regen/cleanse abilities are pretty good. I'm looking for a group healer not just single allies. My best healer is an allied soldier but he is currently only a 3 star so he doesn't survive long in places like the underworld. Is he worth evolving or would a different character be best? I just need to know what to look for. Also which talismans are best for maximum healing? From what I've seen those that boost magic seem to be the best but I'd like to know specific combos people are using for healers. Any input is appreciated.

Concierge and Second-Opinion Radiology: Review of Current Practices.
Radiology's core assets include the production, interpretation, and distribution of quality imaging studies. Second-opinion services and concierge practices in radiology aim to augment traditional services by providing patient-centered and physician-centered care, respectively. Patient centeredness enhances patients' understanding and comfort with their radiology tests and procedures and allows them to make better decisions about their health care. As the fee-for-service paradigm shifts to value-based care models, radiology practices have begun to diversify imaging service delivery and communication to coincide with the American College of Radiology Imaging 3.0 campaign. Physician-centered consultation allows for communication of evidence-based guidelines to assist referring physicians and other providers in making the most appropriate imaging or treatment decision for a specific clinical condition. There are disparate practice models and payment schema for the various second-opinion and concierge practices. This review article explores the current state and payment models of second-opinion and concierge practices in radiology. This review also includes a discussion on the benefits, roadblocks, and ethical issues that surround these novel types of practices.

According to recent news by TOI – The state cabinet on Tuesday sanctioned Rs 260 crore for GIS mapping(Geographic Information System) of all the C and D municipal corporations, Councils and Nagar Panchayats in the state.

There are 17 corporations and 350 Councils and Nagar Panchayats. The mapping is being done to enable these urban local bodies to earn higher property tax. Currently, the amount that is recovered is around Rs 2,000 crore. Once the exercise is completed, the revenue is expected to double.

Principal secretary Manisha Mhaiskar, urban development department, said the decision to carry out GIS mapping was taken some time back by the high power committee headed by the chief secretary. “The tendering process for appointing the agency to carry out the exercise is already underway but no budgetary account had been created to allow the government to spend for this project. Today the cabinet approved the planned expenditure,” she said.

Property Tax collection is low in almost all urban local bodies on account of three lacunas – properties being left out of the assessment system, under-valuation and misrepresentation such as commercial being shown as residential etc. “The satellite mapping by the Maharashtra Remote Sensing agency will form the base for the data. A house to house survey will be carried out to get the exact number of properties in the jurisdiction of each urban local body,” she said.

Erik Johan Stagnelius

Erik Johan Stagnelius (14 October 17933 April 1823) was a Swedish Romantic poet and playwright.

1810 to 1840 was a time of blossoming in Swedish poetry, and there were several writers of distinguished merit, among them Esaias Tegnér, Erik Gustaf Geijer, Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom and Stagnelius. The brief and mysterious life and death of Erik Johan Stagnelius have given a romantic interest to all that is connected with his name.

Life
Stagnelius was born in Gärdslösa, Öland, where his father was a vicar; he was later bishop in Kalmar on the nearby mainland, which probably influenced Stagnelius's spiritual  thinking. He came from a large family. Stagnelius showed a natural gift for poetic writing from an early childhood. He took his Bachelor's Degree from Uppsala University  in 1814 and got an employment as a clerk in Stockholm. As a person he was said to have been unattractive and unkempt. A woman who knew him, said of his appearance "where in this shabby person lies the beauty which his poetry expresses?".

He was notably gloomy and lived alone for most of his life, although he seemed to flourish during brief visits to his home town. As he first arrived to Stockholm, he strived for success as a poet, but basically this did not come until after his death.

His first publication was the epic of Wladimir den store ('Vladimir the Great'; 1817); followed by the romantic poem Blenda. His singular dramas, Bacchanterna ('The Bacchantes'; 1822), Sigurd Ring, which was posthumous, and Martyrerna ('The Martyrs'; 1821), are esteemed by many critics to be his most original productions. His mystical lyrics, entitled Liljor i Saron ('Lilies in Sharon'; 1820), and his sonnets, which are best read in Swedish, may be recommended as among the most delicate products of the Scandinavian mind.

It is believed that he suffered a chronic physical condition (a side effect of his alleged intense alcohol consumption or possibly Noonan syndrome have been suggested by Swedish researchers) causing him increasing pain, and that he used opium as his main remedy. On the details of his life, little is known. He had only a few friends, and no female companionship. Following his death in Stockholm at the age of 29, no relatives were present at the funeral.

Poetry
Stagnelius has been compared, and not improperly, to Shelley. Several of Stagnelius poems were translated into English by Edmund Gosse (1886). The bulk of his poetry was found in a sack in his shabby apartment after his death. They were almost sent to be burnt, but were instead kept, and several are still appreciated today for their romantic and mystic/spiritual qualities. Perhaps the best known are the poem "Näcken," a romantic verse-based poem about the Nix; Till förruttnelsen ('For Decay') and Resa, Amanda, jag skall ('Travel, Amanda, I shall')

Philosophy
His thinking, which is evident from his later works, is influenced by mystics and romantic philosophers. He was also partly influenced by gnostic beliefs. Not proper, perhaps, in the Christian 19th century Sweden, this possible belief has been thoroughly examined, and is believed to have originated by a reading of the Swedish translation of Ginza Rba, the holy works of the Mandaeism, published as Adam's Book. Other persons whose works he read and were likely influences were Schelling, Jakob Böhme and Plato.

Chilean insurers are optimistic that the central bank, Banco Central de Chile, will increase the limit on investment by insurance companies abroad in the first half of 2017, Diario Financiero reported.

Currently, insurers are only allowed to invest up to 20% of their technical reserves abroad, but a new proposal included in the government's bill to promote productivity, which was promulgated in October, calls for this limit to be increased.

Although the central bank has not yet determined the new limit on foreign investment, insurers have reportedly asked for it to be doubled to 40%.

As of September, Chilean insurers had investments abroad totaling over $7.3 billion, although as an industry only 14.1% of their total portfolio is invested in other countries, according to data from securities and insurance regulator SVS.

However, at least four local insurance companies are approaching the 20% limit, with Consorcio and Compañía de Seguros Confuturo SA nearly there, while BTG Pactual Seguros de Vida and MetLife Chile Seguros de Vida SA are at 17%, the report said.

Using agar to slowly diffuse nutrients is an intriguing idea but why bother? You can use clay to sequester or occlude nutrients much more easily. Clay fertilizer balls are easy to store, ship & are stable. They are easy to make, if you have the clay and a little fertilizer. The nutrients in Jobe's plant sticks is also occluded, I think in some kind of paper & unknown binder. I suspect nutrients can move out of those plant sticks much more easily than it can penetrate through a dense clay though. Osmocote also has a permeable, plastic like coating so that it is a time-release fertilizer for your potted plants. With clay fertilizer balls, you have to wait for the plant roots to grow into the clay ball, I would think. Perhaps some ammonia can diffuse through the clay; I've never tried an experiment to see how quickly.

Next ASUS PadFone S2 could feature Snapdragon 820, 5.5-inch QHD screen and 4GB RAM. A recent leak suggests ASUS is planning on releasing a PadFone S2 during by the first quarter of 2016. By the time it arrives, it’ll be the first PadFone in over a year and could be one of the first to feature Snapdragon‘s next-generation 820 series chip.. When it comes to innovation, or just doing things differently, ASUS caught our attention a few years ago when it first unveiled the PadFone. The company released a phone which slid in to a dock built in to a large touchscreen display, transforming it in to a tablet. It was probably the first notable attempt at a convertible smartphone/tablet, and ASUS isn’t done yet.

Tal Rusak. Wed, 19 Dec 2007 06:19:51 -0800. Hi, I noticed that TOSSIM uses the following formula to compute RSSI: rcv->strength = (int8_t)(floor(10.0 * log(pow(10.0, power/10.0) + pow(10.0, noiseStr/10.0)) / log(10.0))); (in CpmModelC.nc) I notice that this is adding the signal power (gain) and noise levels. I am wondering if this is a true reflection of the physical phenomenon--i.e., in the CC2420, when RSSI is computed (CC2420Packet.getRssi(packet)), do signal and noise strength contribute in an additive fashion? Are there any paper or documents that support this notion? I appreciate any response in advance.. Thanks, Tal _______________________________________________ Tinyos-help mailing list Tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Abstract. Consciousness, or its lack, is often invoked in debates in applied and normative ethics. Conscious beings are typically held to be significantly more morally valuable than non-conscious, so that establishing whether a being is conscious becomes of critical importance. In this paper, I argue that the supposition that phenomenal consciousness explains the value of our experiences or our lives, and the moral value of beings who are conscious, is less well-grounded than is commonly thought. A great deal of what matters to us and about us can be explained by functional and representational properties that may not be sufficient for phenomenal consciousness. I conclude with some reflections on how these claims might affect debates in ethics.

would this query run faster if I partition? Will SQL Server issue 4 queries on separate filegroups and then merge the final results?
Edit:
While this wasn't my original question but Raj and TimTom said it would result in table scan, but the query execution plan shows something else what I said. Am I missing something?

A:

Can partitioning improve performance...

No. Partitioning is never about improving performance, is about data storage management and/or switch-in/switch-out ETL processing. IO parallelism can be achieved with multiple files in a single filegroup w/o the (severe!) drawbacks of partitioning. If you want a good article about partitioning I recommend Kendra Little How To Decide if You Should Use Table Partitioning. 
As for your question: LIKE '%text%' can only be answered efficiently using a fulltext search.



Ahhhhh. The temperatures finally dipped below 90 on the 21st, prompting me to take these pictures.. It was a beautiful day for walking…. or fishing…. or bike riding.. And now, this morning, I was finally able to open the windows to a nice cool breeze.. I wait all summer for this moment. My windows will be open on every nice (not rainy) day from now till May (or April) when it once again becomes too hot and humid.. My favorite month is coming, and bringing with it our 11th Wedding Anniversary.. Lovely Autumn Blessings to you all!. -Phyllis

Comment of the Day: Floating Homes for Houston

COMMENT OF THE DAY: FLOATING HOMES FOR HOUSTON “I’m a ship designer with 20+ years of experience and I will say that a float-off house is absolutely feasible from a technical point of view. A quick check in the used barge market shows that you can get something house-sized (80 ft. by 30 ft.) for $65,000. Of course building something on-site would cost a lot more than construction in a shipyard. Not sure how this compares to what a foundation costs. But you’d need to add in some kind of anchoring system so that your house doesn’t float away when it floods. And permitting would be a whole other kettle of fish. I’m available for moonlighting if any architect wants to investigate this for a client!” [Orang Bodoh, commenting on Where Are Houston’s Floodwater-Ready Homes]

Nice. Just one question: how do you control a floating house?
.
Actually another question: presumably the floatation system for the house is styrofoam of some sort? Can that be designed to double as rigid insulation?

Something in the 30×80 range would be pretty close to the foot print on a 50′ or 60′ lot — I’d bet you could build that with reasonably nice finish out and a secured foundation at around $100/SF- but you’d need to tack on another $20-$30/SF for the lot cost.

Not exactly an affordable solution ($130/SF is a fairly nice production house in Houston) but you’re in the ballpark at least. Biggest problem to solve is how your MEP works when your house elevation is constantly changing.

I didn’t flood this time. All those idiots who bought inside the flood plain and flooded need to stop whining. Oh wait, you didn’t buy in a flood plain either? Well, maybe this city has serious problems that need to be discussed.

The simplest means of securing a floating house would be via a spud – just a pole or two embedded in the ground that the house rides up and down on. Google “spud barge” to see what this looks like. The spuds could be incorporated into the design as a visual element.
.
But I think you’d need to use something with more strength than styrofoam for the hull. A house can’t have a perfect weight distribution; there will be heavy spots and light spots, so you need rigidity to make sure it floats without breaking. In my world we’d use steel but it could be aluminum or probably even fiberglass. You could fill it with insulation if you wanted, but there would need to be some means of inspection so that you’d be certain it would float when the floods come.

Detachable utility hookups are easy and low-tech, used on all sorts of RVs and travel trailers. Scale it up and you’re done. What if the owner/occupant forgets to disconnect? Build in a failure point to the line so that it breaks predictably in a way that can easily be repaired.
.
But even still…okay, so maybe you can buy used barges for prices that appear on the surface to be good enough, and maybe that’d work for somebody that has the time, money, and know-how. I wouldn’t even be especially surprised if somebody hadn’t already done this in some swampy flood-prone place in rural Louisiana or Texas. But manufacturing them from scratch or repairing and retrofitting them with the built-in structural support for rigidity and so on, yeah that’s going to be damned expensive.
.
I have to ask, what’s wrong with stilts?

Amphibious Retrofits Recommended for Flooded Homes: All homes and structures that were flooded from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma should be retrofitted with modular amphibious concrete foundations. Amphibious retrofits are a realistic and practical way to make structures – single family homes and modest-size commercial structures – flood-resilient at all levels of floodwater, for both the near term and decades hence. Homes with amphibious foundations typically sit close to ground level. These foundations look like and replace conventional foundations. With the arrival of floodwaters, the buoyant foundation and its above structure gradually rises straight up along its corner underground “telescoping vertical guideposts” – up 20 feet or higher as needed, floating and well-stabilized on the floodwater’s surface. As floodwaters recede, the structure and its foundation gently settles back down to its original ground-level footing. Overseas, these foundations have gone through years of repeated flooding and are well-proven.

The modular foundations typically consist of an assembly of airtight/watertight marine concrete pontoons which are post-tensioned together to form a monolith foundation that is secured to the underside of the home or structure. The structure must be partially raised so that the original foundation can be replaced or modified in order to slide in the incoming amphibious foundation. Each concrete pontoon encapsulates an environmental-friendly Styrofoam-type buoyant material (expanded polystyrene-EPS) to provide “floatation redundancy” that makes the entire structure 100% unsinkable. The telescoping guideposts are usually placed in the ground out of sight at or under the corners of the amphibious foundation; they prevent any lateral movement to the home or structure while it is floating. The maintenance-free concrete foundations can carry 50-year warranties, some longer. Such foundations are relatively economical to construct; they cost less than 50% of the cost of FEMA’s traditional flood-resilience solution, i.e., expensively elevating structures up 12-18 ft. on many piles. Industry-proven coiled umbilical cords connect all local utilities. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) pontoons can be used in certain situations, as can spud/telephone-pole-type guide posts; concrete provides more stability and telephone pole guide posts are obtrusive-looking.

Amphibious foundations are generally not suitable for buildings which are located in V-Flood Zones or are directly exposed to large open ocean waves or exceed 3 or 4 floors. Otherwise, any structure which can be partially raised is suitable to be retrofitted. Since amphibious foundations and structures are generally not addressed under traditional building codes, some flexibility will be needed from local building officials. (In 2014, senior FEMA officials acknowledged in a series of emails that “amphibious retrofits” were acceptable within FEMA’s construction and design parameters, but such was never publicized.)

Amphibious foundations and retrofits are practically unheard of in the U.S. However, a couple dozen do-it-yourself/homemade amphibious retrofits have been attached under fishing-camp structures in Old River Landing in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana. For a couple of decades now, these amphibious foundations/structures have been successfully rising and falling every year with Mississippi flood waters.

Implementation of recurrent artificial neural networks for nonlinear dynamic modeling in biomedical applications.
Simulation is indispensable during the design of many biomedical prostheses that are based on fundamental electrical and electronic actions. However, simulation necessitates the use of adequate models. The main difficulties related to the modeling of such devices are their nonlinearity and dynamic behavior. Here we report the application of recurrent artificial neural networks for modeling of a nonlinear, two-terminal circuit equivalent to a specific implantable hearing device. The method is general in the sense that any nonlinear dynamic two-terminal device or circuit may be modeled in the same way. The model generated was successfully used for simulation and optimization of a driver (operational amplifier)-transducer ensemble. This confirms our claim that in addition to the proper design and optimization of the hearing actuator, optimization in the electronic domain, at the electronic driver circuit-to-actuator interface, should take place in order to achieve best performance of the complete hearing aid.

New, ultrafast broadband is coming to Whittington. Through the efforts of Whittington residents and businesses, approximately 85 premises will, in the coming weeks and months, gain access to a brand new ultrafast broadband network.. The ultrafast network, delivered via a fibre to the premises infrastructure (FTTP), will offer speeds of up to 1,000 megabits (depending on a chosen package) and will be fully paid for through grants secured by residents and businesses. Currently, an average speed in Whittington is just over 20 megabits, compared to UK national average of approximately 46 megabits. Access to the full fibre technology will offer a fully future proofed solution for those who request it, as access is optional.. If you would like to be kept up to date with progress, please contact the project lead (Rob) via email: alirob12@yahoo.co.uk

about wagamama

at wagamama we believe in the philosophy of kaizen. kaizen means 'good change'

our story

‘kaizen’, meaning ‘good change’ is the philosophy that sits right at our heart. it shapes every dish we create, and pushes us to find better ways in all that we do. we’re restless spirits. forever creating and making things better

we’ve been practising kaizen since 1992, when we opened our first doors in london’s bloomsbury. inspired by fast-paced, japanese ramen bars and a celebration of asian food, wagamama burst into life. we set out to create a unique way of eating. bringing the fresh, nourishing, flavours of asia to all

that was 25 years ago now. two whole decades to sharpen skills and refine recipes. to play with spices and discover tastes. we continue to get better with every day

our food

a little ginger to warm you up. chillies that kick. noodles to nourish the body and soul. our asian inspired menu has been created to soothe, nourish, sustain and inspire. pick from all kinds of rice and noodle dishes, alongside fresh salads and shareable sides. there are desserts, fresh juices, hot drinks, wine, sake and expertly crafted asian beers too

in the name of kaizen, our standards are high. our ingredients are cooked fresh, served fresh. every bowl and plate that we fill with them is served as soon as it’s ready. the colours and aromas, flavours and spices are always at their best when they touch your table

a warming bowl of bold ramen. teppan griddled to perfection. or if you would rather rice, you’re in luck - our menu features many japanese favourites. fresh, authentic menus that are updated seasonally. wagamama is a staple of modern asian cuisine

The Concept Lab reflects our vision of what a designer studio of the future could look like. The Concept Lab is created with the intention of giving interaction designers access to new and emerging technologies that are potentially useful during the conceptual and early prototyping stages of the design process. The Concept Lab space should not only offer access to new technologies, but should also provide an inspiring environment for designers that can accommodate their preferred ways of working. Only if this objective can be reached can we conclude that the Concept Lab is becoming a Living Lab where new designer activities can be monitored longitudinally in a valid way. Currently, the Concept Lab is still under construction and used only by students and staff of the Industrial Design department of the Eindhoven University of Technology..

Relief image printing plates are used in both flexographic and letterpress processes for printing on a variety of substrates, including paper, corrugated stock, film, foil, and laminates. The photocurable elements that are used to make relief plates typically include a support layer and one or more layers of photocurable polymer in the form of solid sheets. The printer typically peels a cover sheet from the element to expose the photocurable polymer and places a silver halide photographic negative or some other masking device upon the photopolymer. The negative-bearing photocurable element then is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light through the negative, thereby causing exposed areas of the element to harden, or cure. After the uncured areas of the element are removed, cured polymer remains as the relief printing surface.
Corrugated boxes and other, relatively large objects that are printed using relief image printing plates often bear actual printing on only a small portion of their total surface area. One way to print such an object is to prepare a single relief image plate having a surface area corresponding to the total surface area of the object. Since only a portion of the object's surface needs to be printed, however, only a portion of the relief image plate will actually used for ink transfer. The remainder of the plate will be unused and, essentially, wasted.
To minimize such waste, those skilled in the art often print relatively large objects with composite printing plates that are prepared by mounting a plurality of relief image printing plates on a common carrier sheet. The individual plates, however, are mounted only on those portions of the carrier that correspond to the portions of the object that actually need to be printed. Although such composite plates do minimize waste, the current system for mounting their constituent relief image plates is laborious and requires careful adhesion of the plates to the carrier while assuring registration to within 0.005 inches on-press for high quality printing and multi-color reproduction. For multi-color reproduction, wherein a single plate is used for printing each of the individual colors, accurate registration of the plates with respect to one another is crucial.
Consequently, there remains a need in the art for alternative processes for preparing composite printing plates. In particular, there remains a need for alternative processes for accurate registration of the constituent relief image printing plates or for processes wherein accurate registration is not necessary.

The UN mission in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been criticized for failing to stop decades of fighting in the country. However, Delphin Ntonyoma argues that the DRC government is also responsible.. In this article originally published in The Conversation and picked up by other media outlets, Ntanyoma argues that the UN mission is being blamed for what should be the DRC government’s responsibility, namely de-escalating violence in the country’s eastern region and finding long-term solutions to peace.. His research into the situation in the DRC suggests that during the 22 years that the UN stabilization mission has been active in the country (MONUSCO), political and military elites have focused on their own interests to the detriment of the vast majority of the population..

Q:

xvfb on a machine with a display, can an application run 'in the background?'

I'm setting up to cron a web scraping job, using xvfb, firefox, and watir on my Mac OS X.
In testing the script so far, firefox pops up visibly on the local desktop, the watir script executes, and then firefox exits (I quit firefox in my script).
I'd like to set the xvfb DISPLAY such that firefox will run, but won't be seen on the local desktop, running 'in the background' so to speak.
Nothing I've been able to find online discusses such a possibility - nor explains that it's not possible.
Is it possible?  If so, what do I need to do to make it work?

A:

This is what we use to build packages whose testsuite require running Xserver in Linux:
#############################################
### Launch a virtual framebuffer X server ###
#############################################
export DISPLAY=":98"
Xvfb $DISPLAY >& Xvfb.log &
trap "kill $! || true" EXIT
sleep 10
...
# start your application/testsuite here

I tried it with firefox in a script. And does what you need (if your firefox in OSX also uses X11 of course).



A learning assessment procedure to re-evaluate three persons with a diagnosis of post-coma vegetative state and pervasive motor impairment.
Detecting signs of learning in persons with a diagnosis of post-coma vegetative state and profound motor disabilities could modify their diagnostic label and provide new hopes. In this study, three adults with such a diagnosis were exposed to learning assessment to search for those signs. PROCEDURE AND DESIGN: The assessment procedure relied on participants' eye-blinking responses and microswitch-based technology. The technology consisted of an electronically regulated optic microswitch mounted on an eyeglasses' frame that the participants wore during the study and an electronic control system connected to stimulus sources. Each participant followed an ABABCB design, in which A represented baseline periods, B intervention periods with stimuli contingent on the responses and C a control condition with stimuli presented non-contingently. The level of responding during the B phases was significantly higher than the levels observed during the A phases as well as the C phase for all participants (i.e. indicating clear signs of learning by them). These findings may have important implications for (a) changing the participants' diagnostic label and offering them new programme opportunities and (b) including learning assessment within the evaluation package used for persons with post-coma profound multiple disabilities.

What is the role of the EVI1 protein in AML?. A gene called EVI1 is known to play a role in the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).. When the activity of EVI1 is high, this makes AML even harder to treat. Researchers still do not fully understand how EVI1 causes AML to develop, and how it enables the leukaemia to resist treatment.. The EVI1 gene produces the EVI1 protein, which can react with other proteins in the cells, and can also control the activity of other genes. Dr Stefan Meyer and his team at the University of Manchester have previously found that changes to the EVI1 protein can alter its function, and now want to explore this further.. By gaining a better understanding of the EVI1 protein and how it works, the team aim to identify possible new targets for treatment in AML.

Effects of temperature and biodegradable organic matter on control of biofilms by free chlorine in a model drinking water distribution system.
This study used annular reactors (AR) to investigate, under controlled laboratory conditions, the effects of temperature and biodegradable organic matter (BOM) on the free chlorine residual needed to control biofilm accumulation, as measured by heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria. Biofilm was grown on PVC coupons, initially in the absence of chlorine, at 6, 12, and 18 degrees C, in the presence and absence of a BOM supplement (250 microg C/L) added as acetate. During the early stages of chlorine addition, when no measurable free chlorine residual was present, a reduction in biofilm HPC numbers was observed. Subsequently, once sufficient chlorine was added to establish a residual, the biofilm HPC numbers expressed as log CFU/cm2 fell exponentially with the increase in free chlorine residual. Temperature appeared to have an important effect on both the chlorine demand of the system and the free chlorine residual required to control the biofilm HPC numbers to the detection limit (3.2 Log CFU/cm2). For the water supplemented with BOM, a strong linear correlation was found between the temperature and the free chlorine residual required to control the biofilm. At 6 degrees C, the presence of a BOM supplement appeared to substantially increase the level of free chlorine residual required to control the biofilm. The results of these laboratory experiments provide qualitative indications of effects that could be expected in full-scale systems, rather than to make quantitative predictions.

Q:

Weak formulations: where should the $\forall$ be placed?

Shoud I write (with the appropriate assumptions on $b$ and $l$)

Find $u\in U$ such that $\forall v \in V$, $b(u,v)=l(v)$

or

Find $u\in U$ such that $b(u,v)=l(v)$, $\forall v \in V$

I tend to go for the first formulation but I often see the second version.

A:

A quantified statement would read: $$\exists u \in V\ \forall v \in V\ b(u,v) = l(v).$$
In plain English it would read $$\text{there exists $u \in U$ such that $b(u,v) = l(v)$ for all $v \in V$}.$$
One often sees the quantifiers $\forall$ and $\exists$ used informally in writing to stand for "for every" and "there exists" whenever these expressions occur, as with your second version.
tl;dr the first is more along the lines of a properly formed mathematical sentence but the meaning of the second is perfectly clear.

A:

Unless you're really writing something about logic, you should avoid using so many logic symbols, it looks a bit ugly. I suggest you pick up any math book, and you'll see very rarely a $\forall, \exists, $ etc.
I would just write, in most cases:

Find $u\in B$ such that for every $v\in V$, it holds that $b(u,v)=l(v)$.

Sure, you can vary in style, or be a bit less verbose, but you should reserve logic symbols for shorthand (writing theorems or proofs in some lecture you're giving, so you can write faster(in the cases that you happen to write this symbols, the $\forall$ at the end or in the middle, is perfectly fine (provided you're clear with the order of the quantifiers, etc))).

If you really want to write formulas in a true formal manner, see this.

Differential Response of Selected Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) Genotypes to Mechanical Inoculation by Tomato spotted wilt virus.
Screening of peanut germ plasm for resistance to Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) has been largely inefficient due to the lack of a screening technique based on mechanical transmission of the virus under controlled environmental conditions. We have studied the reaction of three peanut cultivars (Georgia Green, Georgia Runner, C-99R) and one breeding line (C11-2-39) using a highly efficient mechanical inoculation procedure. The disease response was studied at two temperature regimes, 25 to 30°C (low temperature) and 30 to 37°C (high temperature). Based on percent transmission, symptomatology, distribution of TSWV, and relative levels of TSWV nucleocapsid (N) protein, Georgia Runner and Georgia Green were found to be susceptible, whereas C-99R and C11-2-39 were resistant. Of the four genotypes tested, C11-2-39 had the highest level of resistance to TSWV. The results correlated with the field performance of the genotypes except in the case of Georgia Green, which could not be distinguished from TSWV-susceptible Georgia Runner. Exposure of the inoculated plants to higher temperature (30 to 37°C) resulted in a better resistant response as reflected by reduced systemic infection, localized symptom expression, restricted viral movement, and reduced levels of TSWV antigen. To our knowledge, this is the first report of differential response of peanut genotypes to TSWV using mechanical inoculation. The four peanut genotypes should be useful as reference standards for the initial screening and identification of sources of TSWV resistance in peanut germ plasm.

Our Story

Life in A Postcard

The Hotel Eldorado has been part of BC's destination hotel resort experience since 1926. It is a story of Austrian blue bloods and thrilling vacations, a story of a famous honour bar and Olympic rowers, a story of London cabs and dog shows. From the beginning, it has always been a story of unique hospitality, social events and a welcome that knows no borders.

It was then what it is today; a singularly unique social and vacation experience set in one of Canada's most spectacular destinations, the Okanagan Valley. 300 kilometres from the Lower Mainland in the BC Interior and an easy flight from all major airports, the Hotel Eldorado is located on the shores of Okanagan Lake. For those who have travelled in other countries, you will recognize that this place is one of the most scenic in the world.

We call it Life in A Postcard

Originally the brain child of the Countess Bubna-Littite of Austria, the Hotel Eldorado has welcomed generations of visitors to the Okanagan since 1926. In the 1950's and 60's the El, as locals came to call it (and you may as well), was the hub, the place where locals gathered with friends, where visitors stayed, where generations married and celebrated. The town was small, about 20,000 residents only, but it was a place of energy and enthusiasm and vision. The Hotel Eldorado hosted dog shows and garden parties and croquet with Kelowna mayor John Hindle, and his wife Jennifer, graciously welcoming guests. John would pad about the El barefoot, wishing all a good night when it came time to retire, leaving his patrons to the famous honour bar. One of those celebrated patrons no doubt, Glen Mervyn, fresh from his silver medal race in Canada's eight man skull at the 1960 Rome Olympics. That great sporting history hangs above you in our Lakeside Dining Room, Lounge, and our pool area.

The town is bigger now, but the essence of what it is to stay at the Hotel Eldorado has not changed. It is where adults have come to play since 1926.

Jim Nixon and his family took over the El in the 1980's, rebuilding on the current lakeshore location and building upon the great legacy of those who came before. Now the El has passed to the next generation of ownership. Ted Callahan, CEO of Argus Properties, remembers the Hotel Eldorado from his childhood and knows that ownership brings with it a responsibility to honour those who came before and to embrace the rich traditions of our magnificent hotel.

The Hotel Eldorado is as storied as our town and all those who have graced our doors since 1926. It is a gem and we all look forward to welcoming you to The El.

. By Costas Paris.. A senior party official who has been involved in many electoral campaigns said Mr. Venizelos should expect to lose half of his popularity at the end of this month when the measures are voted in parliament and thereafter “he will basically become a hated public figure like Mr. Papaconstantinou.”. The new government will be greeted by an expected protest of tens of thousands of Athenians outside parliament on Sunday and an even bigger rally when the measures are voted upon on June 30. There are plans to encircle parliament to prevent deputies from voting.. Political analysts agree that Mr. Papandreou will be forced to early elections this year which he is going to lose by a big margin. They also agree that he’ll stay in history as the prime minister who only managed to push back by a few months a messy debt restructuring or a default of a euro-zone member.. Δεν υπάρχουν σχόλια:.

Chronic Liver Disease. If the liver forms scar tissue because of an illness, it’s called cirrhosis. Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin, can be one sign of liver disease. Cancer can also affect the liver.. The liver is the largest organ inside your body, not to mention one of the most important. Without the liver, the body can’t function. The liver converts food into energy and metabolizes alcohol and poisons from the blood. Your liver also makes bile, a yellowish-green liquid that helps with digestion. Chronic liver disease needs to be evaluated promptly to determine if a specific treatment is necessary.

John Tarleton (American settler)

John Tarleton (ca. 1808-1895) was an American settler and rancher. He is best known for endowing John Tarleton Agricultural College, which eventually became Tarleton State University.

He was born in either White Mountain, Vermont or in New Hampshire, probably in November 1808, although one source claims 1811. He was orphaned when he was seven, and went to live with his widowed aunt in Vermont. His brother was sent to another relative in Virginia.

When Tarleton was 13, he left and wandered from place to place all over the country. In Knoxville, Tennessee, he worked as a schoolteacher for a while, before getting a job as a store clerk with the Cowan-Dickerson mercantile. Here he toiled for the next 40 years, living frugally and buying up bounty certificates issued to veterans of the War of 1812, which authorized them "to settle on any unsurveyed or unappropriated public land." He also purchased  of land in Erath and Palo Pinto Counties in west Texas at 12.5 cents an acre.

In 1860 or 1861, he set out to look over his property. He found Native Americans living on the land, so he set up a mercantile store in Waco.

In September 1876, he married wealthy widow Mary Louisa Johnson. They agreed to a contract keeping their estates separate, but when the wife learned that her husband owned a considerable amount of land, she asked for a different division of their property. He refused, and a year and a day after their wedding, she filed for divorce in a St. Louis court. John Tarleton got to the hearings just in time to present his copy of their marriage contract, and the divorce was granted with no division of property. The couple did however remain friends.

In 1880, he revisited his land in Erath and Palo Pinto Counties. The Native Americans had been supplanted by settlers, whom he paid for the improvements they had made. He had his land surveyed and tried to sell plots, with no success, so he became a rancher, with middling success.

John Tarleton died of typhoid fever on September 11 or November 16, 1895. In his will, he left about $85,000, a considerable amount at the time, to establish a college in Stephenville, Texas, which eventually became Tarleton State University. He also directed that his land in Knoxville be used to set up the John Tarleton Institute "for poor, worthy youths of good moral character."

Ethiopia evaluates its animal health surveillance system

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in partnership with the Government of Ethiopia through the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Resources (MoALR), has conducted an animal health surveillance system evaluation between 23 April and 3 May 2018.

The main objectives of the external surveillance evaluation process were to assess epidemiological surveillance capacity of the veterinary service; to evaluate the country’s progress for the surveillance of priority zoonotic diseases under the scope of the World Health Organization’s Joint External Evaluation (JEE); to develop a short and long-term action plan to strengthen the national animal health surveillance system in line with the identified gaps and weaknesses; and to build the capacity of the Ministry to conduct similar internal evaluation missions in the future.

The evaluation was conducted in coordination with FAO and MoALR experts using FAO’s Surveillance Evaluation Tool (SET). SET is a comprehensive tool that allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the national animal health surveillance system and identifies the gaps and areas that need improvement to strengthen the capacity to prevent, detect and respond to zoonotic and high impact animal diseases. The result is a set of recommendations on the tangible actions that can be initiated at country level to achieve realistic goals of improving the responsiveness of the surveillance system.

During the launching meeting held on 23 April 2018, Dr. Yismashewa Wogayehu, Director of Epidemiology at the MoALR noted, “We believe that the result from this exercise will reveal important gaps in the surveillance system that require tangible actions and contribute to improving our surveillance systems.” The meeting, attended by key animal health decision makers, highlighted the SET evaluation methodology and approaches.

The launch of SET was followed by a series of interviews at the national level and field missions. The Southern, Nations, Nationalities and Peoples; Oromia, Afar and Amhara Regional States were selected for the field missions where interviews and document reviews were conducted at various levels to gain a thorough understanding of disease surveillance system in the country. Key stakeholders were interviewed including veterinary professionals and para-professionals in public and private sectors, export abattoir workers, municipal slaughter house workers, livestock traders, community based animal health workers and farming communities.

Findings of the evaluation exercise were presented to the key animal health stakeholders with the view to get feedback on the evaluation scores and recommendations. The SET evaluation was conducted under the auspices of the USAID-funded GHSA (Global Health Security Agenda) programme, which has been under implementation in Ethiopia since 2016 through partnership between FAO and the Government of Ethiopia (MoALR).

Idaho alters school WiFi deal under pressure from lawmakers

Under pressure from state lawmakers, Idaho’s State Department of Education and Education Networks of America have agreed to a change in their statewide high school WiFi deal: ENA will be paid only for the schools it actually connects, rather than a flat fee for all eligible schools whether they participate or not. hat could lower the price for the contract’s first year from $2.11 million to $1.89 million, but key lawmakers say they still have questions about the deal.

“To me, it made no sense being charged the same whether one school signed up or every school signed up,” said Senate Education Chairman John Goedde, R-Coeur d’Alene. But, he said, “The concessions didn’t necessarily satisfy all my concerns. Whether the concessions they’ve made will be palatable enough for the Legislature to appropriate funds again is the real issue.”

State Superintendent of Schools Tom Luna signed the five- to 15-year contract with Nashville, Tenn.-based ENA in July, based on a one-time appropriation from the Legislature of $2.25 million for the upcoming school year. But the contract runs for five years, with options to renew for up to 15 years. It includes a clause that if lawmakers don’t budget money in future years, the contract will end. But it also says the contractor – ENA – owns all the equipment it installs, including miles of cabling to be installed in every Idaho high school to provide wireless networks, and if the contract ends, it must remove everything it’s installed.

Goedde said the cabling issue is another one that concerns him. “I have no problem with them pulling out devices,” he said. “Devices age quickly, and what they install today, in two years will probably be outdated. But I do have an issue with the cable.” An insurance agent, Goedde said, “Any time anybody installs something in a building, it becomes a part of the building.” ENA offered only a partial concession on the cabling, saying it would renounce its ownership rights after the first full five-year term; you can read my full story here at spokesman.com.

Pulmonary vascular resistance and impedance in isolated mouse lungs: effects of pulmonary emboli.
To study pulsatile pressure-flow rate relationships in the intact pulmonary vascular network of mice, we developed a protocol for measuring pulmonary vascular resistance and impedance in isolated, ventilated, and perfused mouse lungs. We used pulmonary emboli to validate the effect of vascular obstruction on resistance and impedance. Main pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures and pulmonary vascular flow rate were measured under steady and pulsatile conditions in the lungs of C57BL/6J mice (n = 6) before and after two infusions with 25 microm-diameter microspheres (one million per infusion). After the first and second embolizations, pulmonary artery pressures increased approximately two-fold and three and a half-fold, respectively, compared to baseline, at a steady flow rate of 1 ml/min (P < 0.05). Pulmonary vascular resistance and 0 Hz impedance also increased after the first and second embolizations for all flow rates tested (P < 0.05). Frequency-dependent features of the pulmonary vascular impedance spectrum were suggestive of shifts in the major pulmonary vascular reflection sites with embolization. Our results demonstrate that pulmonary artery pressure, resistance, and impedance magnitude measured in this isolated lung setup changed in ways consistent with in vivo studies in larger animals and humans and demonstrate the usefulness of the isolated, ventilated, and perfused mouse lung for investigating steady and pulsatile pressure-flow rate relationships.

We chose this restaurant because it was number 2 on Trip Advisor and it certainly deserves it (if not number 1). We booked a table for 12 around 11pm the night before and when we went to double check at lunchtime they'd already got our table prepared and were so lovely and friendly you knew a good night was ahead. They did not disappoint - the food, service and atmosphere were all wonderful. I had the aubergine wrap with fresh goats cheese for starter and the red prawn risotto for main. Both were delicious.

Getting your name out there in the world of filmmaking can be difficult, and it is even harder to do so in the teen filmmaking community. However, Sierra Isley, a 16-year-old filmmaker who attends Decatur High School, has done just that, having written, directed and starred in several short films and web series. Her work, in particular, a four-part (so far) web series based on the Percy Jackson book series (but not attached in any way to the Percy Jackson author Rick Riordan), has garnered an immense following and loads of praise by both teen filmmakers and fans of the books.

I got a chance to be on set for the newest upcoming webisode of Isley’s Percy Jackson completely fan-made web series and interview her cast and crew at Decatur Square. There I was able to not only see an example of her brilliant directorial style but also witness the immense amount of love and compassion that was shared among these dedicated individuals, all of whom are teens. “She kinda brings out the best in us during her work,” says 12-year old actress Kelsey Deleshaw. “I think she does a really good job at doing that.” You can see all of Sierra’s work here.

“A lot of entertainment that people are watching these days has to do with teenagers,” Sierra said. “There are kids everywhere, but they’re either represented in a very Disney way … and then they’re represented in a very overdramatic way where they’re not taken seriously… So I think that bringing the actual mind of a teenager into the situation and letting people, like myself … write down the characters and write the stories, that’s what helps teenagers connect with TV shows and movies and entertainment.”

NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) — A “Don’t Tread on Me” flag, hoisted by veterans on public property in New York, has been ordered down because of its recent association with the tea party.. The veterans are threatening to sue. A prominent conservative law firm has taken up the case. Its chief counsel says the city of New Rochelle has violated equal protection and free speech.. The veterans say their decision to raise the flag at a city-owned armory had nothing to do with the tea party. The banner, known as the Gadsden flag, has represented America since the Revolution.. But the city manager says there were complaints that the flag makes a political statement that shouldn’t be allowed on public land. The City Council voted against a proposal to fly the flag again..

Etude House recently launched a new lipstick line with a new texture - Chiffon! The Chiffon texture mixes the softness and moisture from cream textures with the vivid and long lasting properties of matte lipsticks. There are 12 colors in the new Chiffon line and Etude House sent me two to review as part of their Pink Bird program! I received PK027 Pit-A-Pat Chiffon Pink* (Krystal of F(x)'s Pick!) and BE109 Flutter Chiffon Beige*. The Etude House Dear My Blooming Lips-Talk lipsticks contain 0.11 ounces / 3.4 grams of product and retails for $12.40 on the Etude House global website here!

The Etude House Dear My Blooming Lips-Talk Chiffon Lipstick in PK027 Pit-A-Pat Chiffon Pink* is a dark (but still vivid) blue based almost magenta pink. In certain lights, it also looks like a pink based reds and I'm a fan of those shades.

My eyes look dead, but please note that that's not a reflection of how I feel about these lipsticks!

When I saw the promo pictures of Krystal wearing PK027, I was pretty worried that it would be way too bright for me. It's still out of my comfort zone of wearing mostly dark reds, but I feel like it's the perfect pop of color lipstick shade when the rest of my makeup is more toned down.

The Etude House Dear My Blooming Lips-Talk Chiffon Lipstick in BE109 Flutter Chiffon Beige* is a slightly warm nude lipstick. The other person promoting this lipstick line is LilyMaymac (Instagram here!) and she's been doing a lot of promo shots with this shade. It looked gorgeous on her and so I was excited to see this shade in my Pink Bird Box.

Most of my nude lipsticks are more brown or rose tones to them, but BE109 is the perfect nude shade for my skin tone. There is a touch of warmth to it that is more flattering to my skin but I totally get why people love nude lipsticks now.

PK027 Pit-A-Pat Chiffon Pink / BE108 Flutter Chiffon Beige

I had to use my old camera to take these swatch photos. For some reason, my higher quality camera kept making PK027 look way more orange.

Finish wise, the Chiffon lipsticks set to be a soft matte. It reminds me of the NYX Soft Matte Lip Creams, Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lipcolor, and L'oreal Infallible Pro-Matte Gloss but in bullet form and the Chiffon lipsticks don't feel as slippery/greasy on the lips.

These lipsticks don't last as long as other matte non-liquid lipsticks I have in my collection, but they have so much more comfortable. They still last a long time though and they also fade with a lot of dignity. They never look blotchy or uneven even if I've been eating or drinking a lot during the day.

True to Etude House's claims, the Chiffon lipsticks feel creamy and smooth on the lips. My lips have been acting up and there are more flakes and lines, but these lipsticks just smooth over those spots without any problems at all.

Final thoughts: I was already a huge fan of Etude House lipsticks and lip products, but they did amazingly well on their Chiffon formula. They're incredibly comfortable and don't feel drying at all. I've been mostly using liquid lipsticks, but these Etude House Dear My Blooming Lips-Talk Chiffon Lipsticks are great choices when my lips are feeling too dehydrated. I highly recommend getting BE109 especially if you're around my skin tone! PK027 is also lovely, but it may be out of some people's comfort zone like my own. Both formulas feel exactly the same and so that makes me pretty excited to try out other colors from the Chiffon range. If they're all consistent, they'll probably be my favorite bullet/traditional lipstick formula.

Have you tried Etude House lipsticks? How do you feel about soft-matte finishes?

This was a blue on blue glitter-groovy mani! I used a dusty blue StrangeBeautiful for my base color (two coats). It seems to me to look close to Illamasqua Force. I don't think I've worn Force yet...but then again, my bottle has drastically changed colors since I bought it. Weird.. I used a coat of Shimmer Polish in Jenny over top, then followed with Gelous and Sephora X top coat.. I loved this mani. It was one of those where the more you look at it, up close, the better it gets!. Shimmer Polish makes some super beautiful blends, I must say. Love!here. And yes, I have many more, still, untried!

Between 1905 and 1930, the See America First idea evolved from a western booster slogan encouraging Americans to tour the West to a generic tourist emblem promoting scenic nationalism and American exceptionalism. This dissertation provides a cultural history of the varied evocations of “See America First,” examining the ways in which tourist industries and advocates used the slogan to promote quintessentially American sites, and how tourists invoked the slogan to re-imagine themselves within that tourist landscape.

Dear Experts, I am using elastix 1.6 (32) on Intel Mobo with E7500 Procie, and with Digium TDM410 with 2xFXS port and 2xFXO port. I noticed that when I dial a number using the FXS Extension the elastix will dial the FXO Outbound ZAP trunk after waiting 4 seconds, whilst when I am using the softphone the elastix will dial directly the trunk without waiting a second. How to make the elastix dial directly the trunk without waiting using the FXS extension? Awaiting your respond soon and thank you very much. Best regards, Ismed

Abstract. As the size of material decreases to nanoscale, fundamental material properties such as Young's modulus are different from bulk values. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to explain the difference in experimentally observed Young's modulus values between zinc oxide nanowires and bulk zinc oxide. As a binary compound material (such as zinc oxide) is strained, the effective charge on the ionic constituents of the material changes (in this case zinc and oxygen). The strain induced charge redistribution effect is more significant in nanostructures (such as nanowires) because of their higher fracture strains compared to their bulk counterparts...

The present invention relates to a control apparatus and a control method for an internal combustion engine, and more particularly to a control apparatus and a control method for an internal combustion engine, the control apparatus including means for controlling an air/fuel ratio and means for determining deterioration of the catalyst based on an oxygen storage volume of the catalyst.
Among control units for controlling the air/fuel ratio of an internal combustion engine, there is a type that computes an absolute volume of oxygen stored in a catalyst based on output of an air/fuel ratio sensor (an O2 sensor or a linear air/fuel ratio sensor) for detecting exhaust components installed on the upstream side of the catalyst in the exhaust passage of the engine and also based on output of an airflow sensor for measuring a volume of air drawn into the combustion chamber of the engine, and that controls the air/fuel ratio based on an estimated oxygen storage volume of the catalyst (e.g., JP-A-2002-81339).
As a detector for detecting a degree of deterioration of the catalyst, there is a type that estimates an absolute volume of oxygen stored in the catalyst based on output of an air/fuel ratio sensor mounted on the downstream side of the catalyst, and detects deterioration of the catalyst based on this estimated value (e.g., JP-A-5-133264). In addition, there has been proposed a diagnosis unit for diagnosing deterioration of the air/fuel ratio sensor, which is designed to improve the robustness (anti-deterioration properties) of the air/fuel ratio sensor on the upstream side of the catalyst (e.g., JP-A-8-220051).

WITH YOU. RELEASE DATE: NOVEMBER 1ST, 2021. Our world changed five years ago, and it left behind this gaping hole in our relationship.. We were now trying to figure out a way to move past a tragedy without losing ourselves in the process.. Married, with a son, we needed to communicate but neither of us wanted to talk about our loss. Instead, we focused on our little boy.. Finally, after having had enough, we took a trip, learned new things about each other, and fell into an even deeper kind of love.. We revealed new truths about one another and because of that, we could come out of this stronger in the end..

Q:

What do Teimanim do with regards to modern questions?

It's known that Teimanim follow the opinion of the Rambam exclusively. 
What do they (or even more so Rambamists) do when there are questions not discussed at all by the Rambam? For example,

Do Teimanim use electricity on Shabbos?
What do they do regarding date-lines?
What do they do when they are in the far north where there is no sunset?

Do they follow other poskim in such cases? Do they have their own responsa where they try to deduce the Rambam's opinion?

A:

(In order of your original question)
First of all, I would like to correct an apparent misconception regarding the halakhic positions of traditional Temanim. While it is true that they they generally follow the Rambam as opposed to later authorities, at no time in their history did the Jews of Yemen follow the Mishneh Torah exclusively. Instead, the previous Mara De-Athra of Yemen - i.e. before the time of the Rambam - was the Rasag (Rav Sa`adia Gaon) and even then they followed other Gaonic opinions in many areas of halakhah. While there were strains of "Rambamists" in Teman who attempted to exclusively follow the Rambam in all matters, the sentiment never truly caught on, even among the Dar Daim of early 20th Century. 
(NOTE: When we speak of "traditional Temanim" in this regard, we are really talking about the Baladhim and not the later Shami'im who abandoned many of their ancestral traditions in favor of adopting Sefaradi practices based largely on the Qabbalah and the Shulhan Arukh of Rav Yosef Karo.)
Regarding the problems of modernity, the problem for the Mishneh Torah is not so different from the Shulhan Arukh. In actual fact, Rav Karo merely quotes the language of the Rambam in about 85% of his code. So, what is difficult for one is difficult for the other. However, from my experience, Temanim who still follow the Rambam attempt to derive - using logic and the Gemara - the shitah of the Rambam for more modern halakhic issues. Rav Ratzon Arusi shlit"a will often learn through the traditional sources, such as the Tur and the Shulhan Arukh, as well as modern poseqim like Rabbi Mosheh Feinshtein z"l in order to determine the correct halakhic position in his estimation. 
In many instances, things which are "issues" for later codifiers of halakhah are simply non-issues in the halakhic formulation of the Rambam. So, they will simply disregard it and teach their communities that for the Rambam it was not an issue and that one is not required to worry about it.

While there are groups of traditional Temanim who do use electricity on Yomim Tovim, there are none who use electricity on Shabboth. Those who use electricity of Shabboth are not Temanim at all, but only "Rambamists" who generally take a simplistic and almost "Karaite-style" approach to the text of the Mishneh Torah. An approach which has led to a multitude or errors - some of which are rather severe - among non-Temani [would-be] devotees of the Rambam.
They handle the question in similar manner to other authorities. However, the premise(s) for determining any one position regarding date lines are taken from the Rambam as opposed to other authorities.
The answer to this question is essentially the same as above.

As for modern halakhic commentaries and responsa, you can find thousands of such questions and answers on the following websites (which are in Hebrew ONLY):
A. www.net-sah.org
B. www.moreshet.co.il - there are many rabbanim who contribute to this site, so click on the "Ask The Rav" tab, and then select "Rav Ratzon Arusi" to see his pisqei teshuvah according to the Rambam.



Evidence in favor of the existence of a kinetic barrier for proton transfer from a surface of bilayer phospholipid membrane to bulk water.
When the hydrogen-ion flux is induced by nigericin across the planar bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) with bulk pH values being equal at the opposite sides of the BLM, formation of a difference in boundary potentials (delta phi b) on the membrane is observed by the method of inner membrane field compensation. pH gradients are titrated routinely by the addition of sodium acetate at one side of the membrane. The increase in buffer concentration (citrate, phosphate, Mes) leads to a decrease in delta phi b. delta phi b forms in the presence of phosphatidylserine in the membrane-forming solution only. It is concluded that the steady-state difference of the hydrogen ion binding to the opposite surfaces of the membrane (HIBD) is created under the conditions of equal pH values near surfaces of the BLM. The model of the processes implies that nigericin transfers proton predominantly from interface to interface while acetate transfers the proton from bulk phase to bulk phase. In the other series of experiments the monensin-mediated formation of the HIBD leads to the formation of an potassium-ion gradient in the presence of nigericin. Thus, a possibility of performing a work due to the formation of HIBD is demonstrated. Owing to these properties the hydrogen-ion binding difference can be interpreted in a first approximation as a difference of surface hydrogen-ion concentration at the opposite sides of the membrane, arising due to the existence of a kinetic barrier for the proton transfer at the membrane interfaces. These findings can be significant for the mechanism of energy transduction in membrane phosphorylation in mitochondria and chloroplasts.

I am here to discuss how to choose a splitting maul. A splitting maul is a large wedge headed wood chopping axe. It is designed to chop wood designed to split up wood efficiently. The tool uses its large weight and momentum to crush wood fibres by splitting logs along the grain. When choosing a splitting a maul, there are several points to consider. There are a lot of outstanding axes, so it can be a tough decision. This is why i have put together a list you will find helpful.

Teven Jenkins‘ rookie season might have to wait. The second-round left tackle will undergo back surgery later Wednesday, according to Bears head coach Matt Nagy.. The “hope is to have Jenkins back this season,” Nagy says, but it doesn’t sound especially promising. Jenkins, the No. 39 overall pick in this year’s draft, was slated to support starters Jason Peters and Lachavious Simmons. Now, he’ll likely have to focus on rehab with an eye on 2022.. The Bears have high hopes for Jenkins. After selecting quarterback Justin Fields in the first round, they packaged No. 52 and a third-round pick to nab the Oklahoma State standout early in the second. And, just a couple of days after drafting Jenkins, the Bears released longtime tackle Charles Leno.. With Jenkins sidelined, the Bears may look to beef up their offensive line in the coming weeks. If they look to the free-agent market, the Bears could consider the likes of Mitchell Schwartz, Russell Okung and Demar Dotson.

Sheffield Buy to Let Deal of the Day – 27 May 2019. Today’s Sheffield buy-to-let deal of the day is brought to the market by Redbrik.. Located in Handsworth and with an asking price of just £110,000, I feel this property could make a fantastic investment.. The property comprises of a lounge and kitchen diner on the ground floor, the bathroom and both bedrooms are on the first floor.. The property is in an excellent condition and does benefit from having a lot of character such as the exposed brick fireplace.. There doesn’t appear much in the way of outside space, but this would be reflected by the low asking price.. On the rental market, I would expect this property to achieve £600pcm, which would generate a rental yield of 6.5%, which is widely considered as a very good yield.<<

Old School House Garden, N7. The Brief: A ground floor flat in a converted school house had an uninspiring garden which the owner was desperate to transform into something more interesting. The client particularly disliked the existing brick raised beds, so a solution was needed to retain the mature olive tree and other plants at the level they were planted.. The Solution: A curvy garden design was created to open up the space and sculptural curved corten steel was used to create raised beds. The patio area using exterior porcelain tiles wrapped around the building and a new curved path using clay pavers led to the garden gate – both in shades of grey to work with the red brickwork of the schoolhouse. Planting areas were also increased with a new sunny bed near the sunny to provide foreground interest, and some layered planting in the large curved bed which would enjoy the dappled light under the existing trees.

Major retail chains including Costco Wholesale and Victoria's Secret on Thursday reported sales increases for May that were generally in line with Wall Street's expectations, suggesting consumer spending continues to improve moderately.. Costco said sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 5 percent last month, coming in slightly below Wall Street forecasts because of lower gasoline prices. Fresh food and tools for home repair were stand out categories, Costco said.. Costco is the largest U.S warehouse club chain and competes with BJ's Wholesale Club and Wal-Mart Stores' Sam's Club.. (Read More: What Gives? Retailers Go Gaga for Groceries). Victoria's Secret parent company L Brands reported companywide same-store sales rose 3 percent, and the company, which also owns Bath & Body Works, expects a similar jump in June. Analysts were expecting a 3.2 percent rise.

Since 2010, the decline in the Chinese savings ratio has been accompanied by an increase in labor compensation as a share GDP (i.e. wages), as opposed to the income from capital (which includes profits) as a share of GDP. Between 2010 and 2016, when the labor compensation share of GDP increased from 47.4 to 53.1 percent, the savings ratio decreased from 51.5 to 46.4 percent. This increase in the labor compensation share of GDP, which largely stems from businesses paying higher wages to a scarcer and more skilled labor force, is arguably one of the reasons for the increase in China’s consumption over recent years.. The sustainability of this trend—i.e. an increasing labor compensation share of GDP leading to decreased household savings, leading in turn to increased household consumption—depends on two factors: (1) the capital compensation share of GDP going down so that the labor compensation share can continue to rise and (2) the equality of the distribution of labor compensation.

Load effects on spatial working memory performance are linked to distributed alpha and beta oscillations.
Increasing spatial working memory (SWM) load is generally associated with declines in behavioral performance, but the neural correlates of load-related behavioral effects remain poorly understood. Herein, we examine the alterations in oscillatory activity that accompany such performance changes in 22 healthy adults who performed a two- and four-load SWM task during magnetoencephalography (MEG). All MEG data were transformed into the time-frequency domain and significant oscillatory responses were imaged separately per load using a beamformer. Whole-brain correlation maps were computed using the load-related beamformer difference images and load-related accuracy effects on the SWM task. The results indicated that load-related differences in left inferior frontal alpha activity during encoding and maintenance were negatively correlated with load-related accuracy differences on the SWM task. That is, individuals who had more substantial decreases in prefrontal alpha during high-relative to low-load SWM trials tended to have smaller performance decrements on the high-load condition (i.e., they performed more accurately). The same pattern of neurobehavioral correlations was observed during the maintenance period for right superior temporal alpha activity and right superior parietal beta activity. Importantly, this is the first study to employ a voxel-wise whole-brain approach to significantly link load-related oscillatory differences and load-related SWM performance differences.

Federal Government Holding Back Money from Idaho Communications Deal. BOISE, Idaho (AP) — The federal government has blocked millions in funding to Idaho’s education broadband system because a lawsuit over the project’s $60 million contract raised questions about who should get the cash.. The Federal Communications Commission is withholding $7 million for the Idaho Education Network, a high-speed broadband network for Idaho high schools. Idaho lawmakers learned yesterday telecom giant CenturyLink and Education Networks of America haven’t been paid by the federal government since last March.. Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter is asking legislators to provide “temporary bridge funding” to pay CenturyLink and other contractors on the project. In the suit, Idaho-based telecom provider Syringa Networks accuses the state of inappropriately awarding the contract to its rivals.

Fluorometric and time-resolved immunofluorometric assays for protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity.
To develop sensitive nonisotopic assays for protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity. The fluorometric assay is based on the fact that phosphotyrosine but not tyrosine forms highly fluorescent complexes with Tb3+. Thus, PTP activity can be followed by measuring the decrease of fluorescence due to hydrolysis of phosphotyrosine. The time-resolved immunofluorometric assay employs tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates, immobilized on microtitre wells. After incubation with PTP, the remaining phosphotyrosine residues are reacted with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody. The immunocomplexes formed are detected with an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-labeled second antibody. The phosphate ester of 5' fluorosalicylate (FSAP) is used as substrate. The fluorosalicylate produced forms highly fluorescent complexes with Tb3+ - EDTA in alkaline solution. The fluorescence is measured with a time-resolved fluorometer. The truncated form of the T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCdeltaC11 PTP) was determined in the range 1100-36,500 U/L by the fluorometric assay and 36-7100 U/L by the time-resolved immunofluorometric assay. The two nonisotopic assays should prove beneficial for the determination and study of various PTP.

Abstract:. Any code C with covering radius R must satisfy a set of linear inequalities that involve the Lloyd polynomial LR(x); these generalize the sphere bound. Syndrome graphs associated with a linear code C are introduced to help keep track of low-weight vectors in the same coset of C (if there are too many such vectors C cannot exist). As illustrations it is shown that t[17,10]=3 nd t[23,15]=3 where t[n,k] is the smallest covering radius of any [n,k] code.

Abstract. Because of the large surface-to-volume ratio of nano-structure, the silicon nanowires (SiNWs) provide a high sensitivity for highly sensitive detection of biological and chemical species. Moreover, the SiGe-on-Insulator (SGOI) by Ge-condensation process can enhance the mobility of hole carrier and then improve the nanowires's conductance. In this study, we discuss SiGe nanowire structural effect by changing Si/SiGe stacked ratio and oxidation effect in different annealing ambient. The optimized Si/SiGe stacked structure with suitable oxidation process has more twice enhancement of sensitivity compared to conventional SiNWs biosensor.. Publication series. Conference.

A new campaign to protect the Arctic has launched in the capital, backed by the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood.

A new photography exhibit in Waterloo station shows 60 celebrities promoting the campaign to stop drilling in the polar region by the oil company Shell, which is planned to go ahead this month.

The campaign lauched by Greenpeace is asking Londoners to sign their online pettition to #SaveTheArctic, aiming to reach 10 million signitures.

London Live were at the launch of the campaign.

We got in touch with Shell to comment on the petittion and the allegations made by the activists.

A Shell spokesman said: "Shell respects the right of people to protest against the activities we undertake to ensure the world's energy needs are met.

“However, it is disappointing that yet again, Greenpeace chooses to focus on mounting publicity stunts rather than engage constructively in the debate about how to meet the world’s growing demand for energy while reducing CO2 emissions.

“We believe we can play an important role in developing the Arctic’s energy resources. We choose to explore there because we have the expertise and experience to operate responsibly and be profitable at the same time.

“Many Arctic peoples and governments agree with that judgment. They support the opportunity to explore for oil and gas in their territories and those governments have awarded Shell the licenses to conduct those operations.”

“The reality is that hydrocarbons will remain a major part of the world's energy system for many years, not least because they provide the path to prosperity for many millions of people in the developing world, enabling them to enjoy living standards that the western world takes for granted.

“Shell is actively engaged in developing solutions to the global energy challenge. We are pioneering Carbon Capture and Storage technology, calling for a robust global price on carbon, and producing more gas, the least CO2-intense hydrocarbon. We are working with many constructive NGOs and other organisations on these and other issues, in order both to raise the level of public understanding of the energy challenge and to ensure that the world moves towards a lower-carbon, higher energy future.”

With divorce, it’s understandable that some men might want to rip off the band-aid as fast as possible. Rushing the process or making decisions fueled by emotion instead of reason can easily lead to mistakes. A man who feels guilty or just wants out of the relationship, might give in to whatever his former spouse is demanding, even if it’s unreasonable.. Another man might be so angry at his former spouse for leaving that divorce becomes a tool for personal revenge. Other men may simply ignore divorce papers as a way to delay the inevitable. Understand that making these kinds of emotionally driven mistakes in divorce can yield devastating lifelong consequences for your relationships with your kids, your finances, and your future..

a1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104. The initial stages of silicate growth on graphite are characterized with atomic force microscopy. The morphological development indicates that decomposition of tetra ethyloxysilane at low pressure produces films of 3 nm clusters located at undercoordinated carbon sites. Clusters eventually cover the surface, at which point a second layer grows. In higher pressure deposition multiple layers of clusters grow simultaneously. A comparison of the oxidation behavior of surfaces with defects completely and incompletely terminated with SiOx shows that edge recession is the primary oxidation mechanism and that the site specificity of SiOx is effective in inhibiting oxidation..

Up-converted emission in a series of phenylazomethine dendrimers with a porphyrin core.
The nonlinear optical and time-resolved properties of a series of phenylazomethine-porphyrin dendrimers are reported. The linear optical properties were also investigated, and the efficiency of the energy transfer process was obtained. Measurements were also carried out with the basic building-block molecules. The process of frequency up-converted emission was observed in these porphyrin dendrimers. The mechanism for this effect is investigated and related to the process of "hot-band" absorption in the phenylazomethine-porphyrin system. Time-resolved measurements also suggested efficient intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution in these systems. These properties suggest that the porphyrin dendrimers may also have applications in light harvesting of low-frequency photons, as well as in sensors.

An alpha 2 beta 1 integrin-dependent pinocytic mechanism involving intracellular vacuole formation and coalescence regulates capillary lumen and tube formation in three-dimensional collagen matrix.
Human endothelial cells, when suspended within three-dimensional collagen matrices, develop intracellular vacuoles that coalesce to form capillary lumens and tubes. Vacuole and lumen formation are completely dependent on the collagen-binding integrin alpha 2 beta 1, while other endothelial cell integrins had no apparent influence. Vacuole formation occurs by a pinocytic process with internalization of plasma membrane and molecules from the extracellular space, such as fluorescent tracers. By immunofluorescence, vacuole membranes were found to contain associated cell surface proteins, proteins involved in endosomal trafficking (i.e., caveolin and annexin II), and F-actin. Furthermore, some vacuole compartments contained von Willebrand factor. Integrin-regulated vacuole formation and coalescence are major mechanisms controlling capillary lumen and tube formation within a three-dimensional extracellular matrix.

Do serum hepcidin-25 levels correlate with oxidative stress in patients with chronic kidney disease not receiving dialysis?
Iron metabolism is an important factor of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hepcidin is a regulator of iron homeostasis and has a major role in the anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Oxidative stress (OS) is also associated with iron metabolism. However, the clinical utility of hepcidin, especially its association with OS, in CKD patients not receiving dialysis is still unclear. We recruited 117 patients (62 ± 15 years, 85 males, and median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 22 ml/min/1.73 m2) with CKD not receiving dialysis. Serum 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of DNA oxidative injury, and serum hepcidin-25 were measured by ELISA and by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. Hepcidin-25 was associated positively with ferritin, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and 8-OHdG, and negatively with eGFR and hemoglobin. Sex, oral iron, hemoglobin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), ferritin, and hsCRP were independently associated with hepcidin-25 in a multiple regression model. In contrast, neither eGFR nor 8-OHdG independently affected hepcidin- 25. The close association between hepcidin and serum ferritin, oral iron and hsCRP indicates that it plays a key role in the pathogenesis of anemia in patients with CKD not receiving dialysis. In contrast, effects of eGFR and OS were not apparent.

Subgrouping on the basis of shared innovations may be motivated by a set of phonological innovations, as we saw above. But it may equally well, as we shall see below, or in some cases even preferably so, be based on morphosyntactic changes. Parallel to our discussion of phonetic and phonological changes and their natural basis in the preceding chapters, we will begin by investigating the methodology behind the reconstruction of morphological changes. Next, we shall ask ourselves: What are &#8220;natural&#8221; morphological and syntactic changes?

The China Remote Sensing Satellite North Polar Ground Station is seen in Kiruna, Sweden. China has a total of four domestic ground stations located in Miyun in Beijing; Sanya in Hainan province; Kashgar in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region; and Kunming in Yunnan province. (Provided to China Daily)

China's first satellite station overseas was put into trial operation on Thursday.

The China Remote Sensing Satellite North Polar Ground Station is above the Arctic circle, half an hour's drive from Kiruna, a major mining town in Sweden.

An inauguration was held in the Esrange Space Center, where the station is located, on Thursday.

Chen Yuming, Chinese ambassador to Sweden, sent a letter of congratulations stating that the ground station has laid a solid foundation for long-term relations between China and Sweden in science, technology and economic cooperation.

"Since China and Sweden established diplomatic ties 66 years ago, the two sides have achieved fruitful outcomes in bilateral cooperation. I am sure that expanding cooperation in space projects will play a positive role in bilateral relations and social economic development of the two countries, making contributions to the peaceful use of outer space and benefiting all humanity," Chen said in the letter.

"Kiruna is an ideal place for remote sensing satellite data reception. With this ideal location, and with this high-performance antenna, Chinese Earth observation satellites will acquire global data more efficiently, and hence respond to user application requirements, such as disaster monitoring, better and quicker," said Liu Jianbo, deputy director of the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

China has ground stations in Miyun in Beijing; Sanya in Hainan province; Kashgar in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region; and Kunming in Yunnan province. The four ground stations receive satellite signals covering 70 percent of the Asian continent.

Domestic stations can receive a signal from each satellite five times a day when it passes overhead, while the new station can receive signals up to 12 times a day.

In addition, the new station can acquire satellite data in any part of the world within two hours.

"It is capable of receiving all-weather, all-time and multi-resolution satellite data, and it is an important complement to the four domestic stations," Liu said.

The Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth has been in charge of building and operating the five ground stations. Construction started in the 1980s, and the ground station network now receives and processes data sent from more than 30 satellites.

Assessment of a low-cost, point-of-use, ultraviolet water disinfection technology.
We describe a point-of-use (POU) ultraviolet (UV) disinfection technology, the UV Tube, which can be made with locally available resources around the world for under $50 US. Laboratory and field studies were conducted to characterize the UV Tube's performance when treating a flowrate of 5 L/min. Based on biological assays with MS2 coliphage, the UV Tube delivered an average fluence of 900+/-80 J/m(2) (95% CI) in water with an absorption coefficient of 0.01 cm(-1). The residence time distribution in the UV Tube was characterized as plug flow with dispersion (Peclet Number = 19.7) and a mean hydraulic residence time of 36 s. Undesirable compounds were leached or produced from UV Tubes constructed with unlined ABS, PVC, or a galvanized steel liner. Lining the PVC pipe with stainless steel, however, prevented production of regulated halogenated organics. A small field study in two rural communities in Baja California Sur demonstrated that the UV Tube reduced E. coli concentrations to less than 1/100 ml in 65 out of 70 samples. Based on these results, we conclude that the UV Tube is a promising technology for treating household drinking water at the point of use.

Involvement of glutathione oxidation reduction in parathyroid hormone secretion.
This study determines whether calcium affects glutathione metabolism and whether glutathione metabolism may influence parathyroid (PTH) secretion in collagenase dispersed bovine parathyroid cells. Reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) were measured fluorometrically and enzymatically while PTH secretion was determined by radioimmunoassay. The total GSH and GSSG content of parathyroid cells was found to range from 1.59 to 1.71 micrograms/mg cell protein, and this did not vary significantly with changes in extracellular calcium. An increase in the medium calcium concentration from 0.5 to 2.0 mM did, however, cause an increase in GSSG from 0.43-0.54 to 1.19-1.20 micrograms/mg protein with a concomitant decrease in GSH. The compound 2-cyclohexen-1-one was used to deplete the cells of GSH at a low-calcium medium (0.5 mM) to levels seen in high-calcium medium (2.0 mM). This treatment was found to inhibit PTH secretion in the low-calcium medium, as if the cells were incubated in high medium calcium. Both 2-cyclohexen-1-one and calcium caused a rapid decrease in reduced GSH levels and in hormone secretion. The ketone was not found to affect cellular protein synthesis, indicating that there was no nonspecific toxic effect of this treatment on the cells. These results suggest that changes in the calcium concentration of the medium affect the GSH/GSSG ratio of dispersed parathyroid cells. Changes in the GSH/GSSG ratio induced by calcium may be related to changes in PTH secretion.

104. Yellow-spotted Emerald – Somatochlora flavomaculata – European Dragonfly photo. The Yellow-spotted Emerald ( Somatachlora flavomaculata ) is an important species on Lesvos as it is declining throughout its range and only has small and widely separated populations towards the south. Confirming the behavioural comment in Dijkstra’s Field Guide I duly found it flying along paths through the extensive reed bed at Dipi Larisos Marsh on the northern edge of the Geras Gulf. One male I watched occupied a short territory and flew constantly for nearly four hours – hence the in-flight photograph !. KEY I/D FEATURES. As its English name implies, the key distinguishing feature in both sexes is the yellow spots along the lower sides of the abdomen. Those on Segments 2 and 3 are large. The yellow colour is more marked in younger individuals and darkens with age to become almost lost in mature dragonflies.

Ramsey pricing has been proposed in the pharmaceutical industry as a principle to price discriminate among markets while allowing to recover the (fixed) R&D cost. However, such analyses neglect the presence of insurance or the fund raising costs for most of drug reimbursement. By incorporating these new elements, we aim at providing some building blocks towards an economic theory incorporating Ramsey pricing and insurance coverage. We show how coinsurance affects the optimal prices to pay for the R&D investment. We also show that under certain conditions, there is no strategic incentive by governments to set coinsurance rates in order to shift the financial burden of R&D. This will have important implications to the application of Ramsey pricing principles to pharmaceutical products across countries.. Available at:

What is the life span of the person with HIV ?

The patient after initial HIV infection, viral load was very high. The immune system then responded and lowers the number to a base level.
Now again the immune count is been reduced to 200, wherein doctor has suggested that the patient might require a separate treatment without connecting with the outside world.

what is the life expectancy of the person ? and how harmful is she to live among the common masses?

Nowadays, we have extremely effective antiretroviral treatments for HIV. When diagnosed quickly and treatment is started as soon as possible, prognosis for HIV+ individuals is very good. Most people are able to bring down their viral load to very low or even undetectable levels when they adhere to their medication. Undetectable levels refers to less than 50 copies of viral RNA per mL of blood. HIV+ individuals who comply to their medication and stick to it consistently end up living normal lives with regular life spans! Sometimes, HIV+ individuals end up being even healthier than their HIV- counterparts, since they're more conscious of their health and take proactive measures such as eating healthy and exercising. Overall, the life span of HIV+ individuals can be the same as anyone else when they take their treatment properly.

Additionally, since treatment reduces the level of the virus in the body and the blood, it greatly decreases how infectious someone is. There is no need for an HIV+ person to ever be quarantined or separated from the world. If anything, the person should just disclose their status to any sexual partner, but other than that, they are free to live a normal life. When someone has a low or undetectable viral load, it's very unlikely that they will transmit the virus to anyone else.

The Aizenman, Chinn and Ito indices that measure how countries align their policies to conform to the Trilemma [1][2] [3] have been updated to 2009. Below is a time series plot of exchange rate stability, monetary independence and capital account openness for China.

The monetary independence index depends on the correlation of a country's interest rates with the base country's interest rate, the exchange rate stability index is measured by the exchange rate volatility, and the degree of financial integration is measured with the Chinn-Ito capital controls index.

The data (Excel, Stata), as well as associated documentation are here. All you wanted to know about the capital openness index, here.

Yesterday, Greg Mankiw discussed the trilemma in international finance, noting that countries can trade off between capital mobility, monetary policy autonomy, and exchange rate stability, but cannot fully all three of those objectives at a given time.

Jérémie Cohen-Setton has a nice review of the recent blog-literature regarding the trilemma on Bruegel:
The challenge of managing capital flows in and out of emerging countries and the difficulty of transmitting a uniform monetary stance across EMU countries have generated renewed interest in the possibility of better navigating the Mundell-Fleming

Mr. Trump has proposed blocking remittances of illegally earned wages to Mexico as a means of inducing Mexico to pay for a border wall. What does this imply for financial openness?
As argued O’Grady in Wall Street Journal:

From "Rounding the Corners of the Policy Trilemma:
Sources of monetary policy autonomy," by Michael Klein and Jay Shambaugh:
A central result in international macroeconomics is that a government cannot simultaneously
opt for open financial markets, fixed exchange rates, and monetary autonomy; rather, i

Chinn-Ito Index Updated to 2011
Our index, based upon the IMF’s tabulation of external account restrictions, has been updated to 2011. We find (1) retrenchment in emerging markets, (2) and regionally, little change on average in East Asia/Pacific and South Asia/Middle East and Africa.

I’ve been wrapping up some long term projects (not planned as long term — they just took longer than expected) on interest rate parity and term spreads, and that spurred me to look at current patterns in interest rates. Some quick observations: interest rates remain higher in emerging markets than in core industrial countries. So too are real rates are higher despite higher inflation rates. And term spreads are larger in the US than other countries.
First, consider nominal interest rates.

Sometimes in my daydreams I have hair that I can run my fingers through, I wear strapless dresses, I’m really good at driving a stick shift car, I have Sissy Spacek eyelids, and Sigourney Weaver narrates my life. Maybe also there’s an early 90’s Jagged Little Pill soundtrack running though my daydreams… but in a totally zen kinda way. I mean…

Daydreams are all well and good. But really, what’s the point daydreaming about different eyelids when there is a stack of freshly made baked doughnuts staring you in the face. Right?

I think I warned you about my new-found baked doughnut enthusiasm. A few weeks ago I made these Brown Butter Doughnuts with Chocolate Glaze, and they felt like just about the best thing EVER. I’m chasing that first baked doughnut high, this time with apples and cinnamon. Join me!

Oh my goodness… let’s just make these doughnuts! Into the mixing bowl goes flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

Easy cake beginnings!

Sugar and spices, too!

Brown butter and grated apples are the heart and soul of these doughnuts. Brown butter adds a nutty richness. Apples add the perfect sweet seasonal flavor. Such a happy pair!

Freshly grated nutmeg is my very favorite fall spice.

If you do one thing for me this Fall… just one, pretty please… I want you to grate your own nutmeg, fresh to-order. All you need is a microplane and whole nutmeg. It’s a game changer.

The browned butter is whisked together with an egg and buttermilk. The wet ingredients meet the dry ingredients. Simple as that.

Stir in the apples and POW.. well almost. We’re so close to doughnuts!

Good instincts! We’ve got them.

I was a bit over-enthusiastic and filled the baking pan a bit too much. My doughnut centers betray me.

It’s cool. Nothing a little Brown Butter Glaze and sweet tooth can’t fix!

A sweet Brown Butter Schmear. Few things are better.

Imagine a little spice cake. Shape that little cake into a doughnut. Add sweet apples. Go heavy on the ground cinnamon and fresh nutmeg. Drench the whole thing in Brown Butter Glaze. This is that!

You need a baked doughnut pan. Just saying.

The new apartment buildings for the University of Tampa are a replacement for the smaller 3-story U-Shaped ResCom dormatory originally built in the 1980s for 234 beds. The new facility has 660 beds to serve the needs of 2,000 ﬁrst year students coming into the University each year.. The project was constructed in three phases. Phase 1 has a 6-story and a partial 7th-story. Phase 2 adds 9- and 10-story wings and include the new grand lobby.. Demolition of the south wing of the ResCom dormatory began in May 2014 and Phase 1 of the new facility was completed in April 2015. The remaining two wings of ResCom were demolished in May 2015 and the remaining phase of the new Palms Apartments was completed in the summer of 2017.. Walter P Moore worked with the architect to create a close columns grid and a light 7” ﬂoor slab which allowed for a spread footing foundation rather than deep piles which resulted in signiﬁcant savings for the owner.

If you're a fan of the movie, this book has everything you loved about it: the gut-wrenchingly funny juxtaposition of lowbrow humor and surrealism, the gore, the impending sense of doom that soaks the narrative until you're coated in a sticky quagmire of horror and humor. All of that is here only amped up by a factor of at least 10. What the movie misses the mark on is the sense of existential dread that permeates the book, making this a novel that is haunting and genuinely scary instead of just being mostly weird and funny like the film.. by Brian S.

MOBILE, Ala. - The University of Memphis men's golf team had a successful opening day of the Mobile Bay Intercollegiate as they sit in second place, and lead seven ranked opponents. Play began 45 minutes later than expected this morning with dew on the course, forcing the teams to not be able to finish the second round. Competition will resume tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m.

"We played really solid today," said head coach Grant Robbins. "The conditions were extremely difficult and I thought everyone handled it very well. We still have a lot of holes left so we just have to keep plugging away."

The Tigers were in third after the first round of play with a 4-over-par 292 as Grant Milner and Steve Lee led the charge for Memphis with 1-under-par 71s to sit in a tie for second.

Lee is currently tied for second and one stroke out of first to lead the Tigers with an even par through 13 holes in the second round. Milner is tied for 15th and is at a 4-over-par through 14 holes. Thomas Perrot moved up more than 30 spots in the leaderboard in the second round, sitting at a 2-under-par through 12 holes after firing a 78 in the first round. Cory Gaylord shot a 75 to begin the day and is at 2-over-par after 11 holes to sit in a tie for 28th. Will Pearson rounds out the Tigers team in a tie for 39th after a first-round score of 75 and a 3-over-par score in the second round after 13 holes.

In the individual tournament, Alex Hoffman is in first with an even-par 71 while John Luke Tyner is tied for 15th with a 77. The two will finish play tomorrow with the final round.

No. 27 Auburn is currently leading the field at an even par with Memphis eight strokes back. No. 19 Illinois is one stroke behind the Tigers while No. 14 LSU and No. 46 Mississippi State are three strokes behind Memphis.

Design & Build

At Sunlight Homes, we coordinate with local builders so we can be alongside you throughout your homebuilding process, from start to finish. Our process begins with the design of your home, where we factor in the location of your lot, the sun’s angles throughout the year, and a number of different factors that go into making your home as energy efficient as possible, while still retaining the specific elements you want in a home. Following our design process, we then work with local builders to oversee that the construction is completed without complications. This process ensures that not only is your home designed to your exact specifications, but that the construction matches the quality of your home’s design.

Green Features

Every Sunlight Home is crafted with careful consideration of its impact on our environment. By blending the art and science of architecture with the latest in green innovation, we create homes that are both visually stunning, while also remaining highly energy efficient. One of the ways we accomplish this is through our expertise in Passive Solar Design. By factoring in the angle of the sunlight at various times throughout the year, we ensure that your home maximizes light when the temperature drops, while also blocking the sun’s rays in the heat of the summer. By utilizing this method, along with the latest in green materials, we provide a home that is truly on the cutting-edge of eco-friendly design.

Ensuring that the insulation of your home is sound is one of the most important factors in its efficiency. Traditionally, stud-frame construction has been used to create the framework of a home. Although this is good for those looking to lower costs, the quality of it’s construction will vary with every build, leading to imperfections and inefficiencies. Structural insulated panels (SIPs) are custom-created in a factory with your specific design in mind, meaning your insulation is precisely crafted to optimize efficiency, and fit perfectly into your unique design.

Hands On Your Home

A home should act as a reflection of those who live within it. It is a place of refuge, relaxation, and comfort, which acts as a safe haven for its residents. As such, a home’s design is crucial to ensuring that it provides the unique needs and comforts for those who live inside it. At Sunlight Homes, we ensure your needs are met by including you in the design process every step of the way. Simply tell us what you want in your home and we will come up with a design that is innovative, eco-friendly and in line with your wants and needs.

Designing Green Since 1975

At Sunlight Homes, we are proud to be one of the pioneers of the eco-friendly housing movement since our inception in 1975. Long before “green” became a buzzword of our culture, we have been designing high-efficiency homes that are as visually stunning as they are eco-friendly. Furthermore, we use our decades of experience in the design of every project we take on, ensuring that our homes always work with the environment, and never against it.

We just may be one of Sunlight Home’s longest-running customers, considering our site visit was in 2006 and actual construction began in late 2008 (house-selling woes!). Given our longevity, we have had the pleasure of working with both Jon and Evan. The passing of the Sunlight Homes torch from father to son in the midst of our build was smooth. We’ve benefitted from both men’s expertise and are grateful for Evan’s availability any time we needed him – especially since we are “owner builders.” While we enjoyed working with Jon on the design and early stages of our home, Sunlight Homes is in more-than-capable hands with Evan at the helm.

- MCF

Our experience with Sunlight Homes was wonderful! After countless hours of research, discussions, and sleepless nights we decided on Sunlight Homes for the simple fact that they truly believed in making the owners’ part of the process. From the initial exchange of emails with Margie, the site visit with Evan and Jon, the cost estimate worksheets, and all the correspondence in between. Our family’s needs and desires were always listened to in the design of OUR HOME. During the site visit Evan laid out a bubble diagram that evolved from our meetings and discussions into something that was truly us. We had high hopes going into the process and Sunlight Homes has met if not exceeded all expectations. We just can’t say it enough, Thank you all!

Sunlight came through with flying colors – Evan was there for us from the start right through to the final stages when we spent several weeks making small changes to get just the house we envisioned. He listened to our wishes and worked them into the design, and when our ideas didn’t make sense he let us know. He also did a great job helping us make adjustments to the parts of his proposal we wanted to modify. We’ve been in the house six months and we love it. It’s beautiful, comfortable, fits into the neighborhood and feels like home. A great design takes a great architect and for us Evan and Sunlight were an excellent match.

National Academies Report Says Teen Neurology Should Shape Juvenile Justice Reform Efforts. |. A new report from the National Research Council suggests that juvenile justice reform efforts should be grounded in the emerging understanding of adolescent development. “Evidence of significant changes in brain structure and function during adolescence strongly suggests that these cognitive tendencies characteristic of adolescents are associated with biological immaturity of the brain and with an imbalance among developing brain systems,” the report says.

One of the nation’s 250 largest firms with offices coast-to-coast and European affiliates, Clausen Miller boasts one of the nation’s leading insurance practices. We worked closely with the firm’s successful marketing director, Kelly Klopotek, creating a firm-wide program, as well as niche campaigns for a number of the firm’s well-known industry groups and practices.. Clausen Miller had not previously undertaken sophisticated branding or advertising activities and many of the lawyers were ready to ratchet up the firm’s efforts. We began by creating a more aggressive visual look and tone to reflect the firm’s personality and culture, rewriting and redesigning the main web and firm brochure.. After training many of the firm’s lawyers in niche and vertical-marketing strategies, we conducted interviews to identify the marketing opportunities most likely to yield quick results, selecting three initial targets, including the defense of construction crane-related accidents.

# Jak funguje internet

> Tato kapitola je inspirována přednáškou "How the Internet works", kterou přednesla Jessica McKellar (http://web.mit.edu/jesstess/www/).

Internet jistě používáš každý den. Ale víš ve skutečnosti co se stane, když do prohlížeče napíšeš adresu jako https://djangogirls.org a zmáčkneš `enter`?

První věc, které musíš rozumět, je, že webová stránka je jen pár souborů uložených na hard disku. Přesně jako tvé filmy, hudba nebo obrázky. Je tu ale něco, co dělá webové stránky unikátními: obsahují počítačový kód nazývaný HTML.

Pokud je ti programování zcela cizí, z počátku pro tebe může být těžké HTML pochopit, ale tvé webové prohlížeče (jako Chrome, Safari, Firefox atd.) jej milují. Webové prohlížeče jsou navrženy tak, aby tomuto kódu rozuměly, plnily instrukce a zobrazovaly soubory, ze kterých je tvá stránka vytvořena, přesně tak, jak chceš.

Jako každý soubor potřebujeme HTML soubory ukládat někam na hard disk. Pro internet používáme speciální, mocné počítače nazývané *servery*. Nemají obrazovku, myš ani klávesnici, protože jejich hlavním účelem je skladovat data a servírovat je. Proto je nazýváme *servery* -- protože ti *servírují* data.

OK, ale chceš vědět jak internet vypadá, že ano?

Nakreslili jsme pro tebe obrázek! Vypadá takhle:

![Figure 1.1][1]

 [1]: images/internet_1.png

Vypadá to jako pěkný bordel, že? Ve skutečnosti je to síť propojených strojů (výše zmíněných *serverů*). Stovek tisíc strojů! Mnoho, mnoho kilometrů kabelů kolem celého světa! Můžeš navštívit stránku mapování podmořských kabelů (http://submarinecablemap.com/), abys viděla, jak komplikovaná tato síť je. Tady je screenshot z té stránky:

![Figure 1.2][2]

 [2]: images/internet_3.png

Není to fascinující? Samozřejmě není možné mít dráty mezi každými dvěma stroji připojenými k internetu. Proto abychom získaly přístup ke konkrétnímu počítači (třeba k tomu, na kterém je uložena stránka https://djangogirls.org), musí být požadavek postupně předáván mezi mnoha různými stroji.

Vypadá to takhle:

![Figure 1.3][3]

 [3]: images/internet_2.png

Představ si, že když napíšeš https://djangogirls.org, pošleš dopis, ve kterém stojí "Drahé Django Girls, chci si prohlédnout stránku djangogirls.org. Pošlete mi ji, prosím!"

Tvůj dopis se pošle na tvou nejbližší poštu. Potom se pošle na jinou poštu, která je trochu blíže tvému adresátovi, potom na další a další, až se doručí do cílové destinace. Jediná unikátní věc je, že když pošleš hodně dopisů (*data paketů*) na stejné místo, můžou se tam dostat přes naprosto jiné pošty (*routery*). To závisí na tom, jak jsou na každé poště distribuovány.

![Figure 1.4][4]

 [4]: images/internet_4.png

Ano, je to takhle jednoduché. Odešleš zprávu a očekáváš nějakou odpověď. Samozřejmě, místo papíru a pera používáš byty dat, ale princip je stejný!

Místo adres s názvem ulice, města a poštovním kódem používáme IP adresy. Tvůj počítač nejprve požádá DNS server (Domain Name System) o překlad djangogirls.org do IP adresy. Funguje to trochu jako staromódní telefonní seznam, kde sis mohla vyhledat jméno člověka, na kterého potřebuješ kontakt, a najít jeho telefonní číslo a adresu.

Když posíláš dopis, musí mít určité náležitosti, aby mohl být správně doručen: adresu, známku atp. Také používáš jazyk, kterému adresát rozumí, že? Stejné platí o *data paketech*, které posíláš, abys viděla webovou stránku. My používáme protokol zvaný HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).

Takže když máš webovou stránku, potřebuješ *server* (stroj), na kterém může žít. Když *server* přijme přicházející *požadavek/request* (v dopise), pošle zpátky tvoji webovou stránku (v dalším dopise).

Jelikož je toto Django tutoriál, budeš se ptát, co Django dělá. Když odesíláš odpověď, ne vždy chceš, aby se všem odeslala stejná věc. Je mnohem lepší, když jsou tvé dopisy personalizované, obzvláště pro osobu, která ti právě napsala, že? Django ti pomáhá s vytvářením těchto personalizovaných, zajímavých dopisů :).

Toxic effect and mechanism of four ionic liquids on seedling taproots of Arabidopsis thaliana.
Arabidopsis thaliana was selected as model organisms to investigate the toxic effect and mechanism of four kinds of imidazolium and pyridinium ionic liquids (ILs) on plant seedling taproots. After exposure to ILs, the growth of seedling taproots was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The toxicity of ILs on seedling taproots was [Bmim][BF4] > [Bmpy][BF4] > [Bmim][Br] > [Bmpy][Br]. The reduction of seedling root cell vitality, aggravation of seedling root cell death, and repression of gravitropic growth responses were observed. The amounts of H2O2 and ROS in seedlings were enhanced with increasing concentrations of ILs. Moreover, the expression levels of cdc2a and pcna1 genes were decreased after exposure to ILs. Our results suggest that ILs can induce the overproduction of ROS in A. thaliana seedling taproots and thus cause oxidative damage to seedling taproots. Meanwhile, ILs alter the expression patterns of two cell cycle-related genes and hence cause the seedling taproot growth inhibition. This work provides an integrated understanding of the toxic effect and mechanism of ILs on A. thaliana seedlings at the molecular and physiological level and also provides theoretical basis and reference for the environmental safety evaluation of ILs, prior to their widespread use and release.

My understanding is to connect SATA cable from Barracuda to new computer.. #1 Is that correct?. #2 Do I need to worry about MASTER/SLAVE settings. #3 Do I need to connect addition power supply to Barracuda and if so - do I just use an open plug from power supply unit?. Thank you in advance for any help. 07-25-2012 09:32 PM. ©2012 Seagate Technology LLC

I have nothing to do with a system that does this to a babe at the base of housing!. I want you to see why you are so strangled to stay behind and work. But not just a knowing of you to do - you are not working! You are just walking around, writing and lectures. That is not work for most. So show the babe that you are more than you. That you are more for many and she follows through rye and catcher for now. Until then - be. Why are you crying for more than you are able to handle? I am here. Love namaste

While a trio of remasters and a Skylanders cameo isn’t quite the Crash Bandicoot revival fans were hoping for, it’s a promising new beginning. And hey, new toy.


When I heard that Crash would be making his current-generation debut in this fall’s Skylanders Imaginators, I cringed. I like Crash. I like Skylanders. Put them together and what have you got? Hopefully not another Spyro situation.

Skylanders debuted in 2011 as Skylanders: Spyro’s Adventure, using the name of the one-time PlayStation-exclusive mascot character as a springboard to launch a new series. Five games later and Spyro is a background character. When fans wonder why there is no new game starring the purple dragon, Skylanders is often blamed.


Look at that tongue. Look at it.

I wouldn’t worry too much, Crash Bandicoot fans. You shirtless, crazy-eyed hero is in a better place than Spyro was back in 2011. The adorable purple dragon was treading water five years ago, and Activision used his head as a springboard, pushing him under while propelling Skylanders to new heights.

That’s not why Activision wants Crash Bandicoot in Skylanders. They want him because he’s hot stuff, and they want a piece of that action.

So we’re getting a Crash Bandicoot figure.


We’re getting a special $99 Crash starter pack for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 (the Crash toy will be cross-platform playable).


And we’re getting a current generation Crash Bandicoot with some pretty sweet moves.

There’s even an official bio to justify his appearance in Imaginators.

In Skylanders Imaginators, a wormhole has opened in Skylands and the great Aku Aku appears! He comes to announce the once in two decades Synchronization Celebration. It is the time when all of the worlds align perfectly. They are having a huge celebration event in the Wumpa Islands and want to invite the Skylanders. But with Kaos on a quest to take over Skylands using his army of Doomlanders,the Skylanders must focus on stopping his evil plans. Never one to shy away from danger, the legendary marsupial Crash Bandicoot travels through the wormhole to join the Skylanders in the ultimate battle against Kaos!




So don’t worry, Crash Bandicoot fans. This could be the beginning of a new era of greatness for your favorite whirling dervish. And if not, at least there’s a toy coming out.

Is exogenous tissue plasminogen activator necessary for antithrombotic efficacy of an inhibitor of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) in rats?
TAFI indirectly reduces the action of tPA on plasminogen. Whether exogenous tPA is necessary for TAFI inhibitor efficacy is unclear. Potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI), a TAFI inhibitor, has shown variable tPA dependence in rat models of arteriovenous shunt thrombosis (required) and microthrombosis (not required). This study was designed to further explore the importance of exogenous tPA in revealing PCI activity in rat models of venous and arterial thrombosis and provoked bleeding. PCI was given as a bolus (5, 10 mg/kg) +/- infusion (5, 10 mg/kg/h) and with or without low dose tPA (5, 10, 25 microg/kg/min). In each instance tPA was adjusted to produce subthreshold thrombus reduction. Arterial thrombosis was induced by FeCl2; venous thrombosis by tissue factor or FeCl2. Bleeding was induced by kidney incision with PCI given (5 mg + 5 mg/kg/h) in the presence or absence of tPA (10, 150, 200 microg/kg/min). PCI was ineffective without exogenous tPA in all tested thrombosis models. With exogenous tPA, PCI decreased thrombus weight 85% in tissue factor thrombosis, 59% in FeCl2 thrombosis, and 46% in arterial thrombosis. PCI prolonged bleeding only when combined with a relatively high tPA dose (200 microg/kg/min) that increased bleeding alone. If the current results predict clinical efficacy, the need for exogenous tPA in combination with TAFI inhibition is a potential problem. However, in acute settings where intravenous fibrinolytics are administered, or indications in which tPA production increases, TAFI inhibitors may prove to be safe and moderately effective profibrinolytic agents.

2-[[[3-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-2-pyridinyl]methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole, also known as lansoprazole, is disclosed in Japanese patent application No. JP-A-61-50978.
Lansoprazole is a well-known gastric acid secretion inhibitor and is useful as an anti-ulcer agent. Lansoprazole has a chiral sulfur within its molecular structure and, hence, occurs as two optical isomers, R-lansoprazole and S-lansoprazole.
U.S. Pat. No. 6,462,058 B1 discloses a crystal of R-lansoprazole and its use as an anti-ulcer agent. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,462,058 B1 and 6,664,276 B2 and PCT Patent Publication No. WO 00/78745 A2 all describe methods to obtain crystals of R-lansoprazole. Exemplary methods for such synthesis include:
a) A fractional crystallization method in which a salt between a racemate lansoprazole mixture and an optically active compound [for example, (+)-mandelic acid, (−)-mandelic acid, (+)-tartaric acid, or (−)-tartaric acid] is formed. The resulting salt is separated by fractional crystallization and then subjected to a neutralization process to give a free optical isomer.
b) A chiral column method in which a racemate or a salt is applied to a column for optical isomer separation. In liquid chromatography, for example, optical isomers are separated by adding the racemate to a chiral column (such as the Daicel® series, produced by Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd.), and eluting in water, a buffer (for example, a phosphate), an organic solvent (for example, hexane, ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile, triethylamine, or mixtures thereof) or mixtures of the foregoing.
c) A diastereomer method in which a racemate and an optically active reagent are reacted to give a diastereomer mixture. The diastereomer mixture is separated to obtain the desired diastereomer, and the optically active reagent is cleaved.
U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,462,058 B1 and 6,664,276 B2 and PCT Patent Publication No. WO 00/78745 A2 also describe the synthesis of various polymorphic forms of R-(+)-lansoprazole. Some of the polymorphic forms described in these references include: a) an amorphous form that is relatively unstable; b) a crystalline anhydrous form; and c) a crystalline sesquihydrate form. These references further provide X-ray powder diffraction characteristics of the crystalline forms of R-(+)-lansoprazole and the use of the crystalline R-(+)-lansoprazole for manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment or prevention of a digestive ulcer.
U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,462,058 B1 and 6,664,276 B2 and PCT Patent Publication No. WO 00/78745 A2 also suggest that various salts of R-(+)-lansoprazole may be prepared such as metal salts, salts of organic bases and salts with amino acids. These references fail to provide any examples for preparing such salts.
U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2003/0181487 A1 describes various metal salts of R-(+)-lansoprazole, including the sodium salt, magnesium salt, lithium salt, calcium salt and barium salt as well as processes for manufacturing these metal salts. This published application states that these metal salts could be used in solid form and exhibited good stability characteristics.
Different salt forms of a pharmaceutically active compound can exhibit different bioavailabilty, solubility, color, compressibility, flowability and/or stability with consequent modification of the profiles of toxicological, safety, clinical effectiveness and productive efficiency. Improved drug formulations are consistently sought after for better bioavailability, better processing characteristics and/or better stability. There is also an ongoing need for new or purer forms of existing drug molecules.

Compute at the Edge. At first glance, this seems like a ho-hum topic- just use whatever Arm or RISC-V solution you need - but think again. We’re now expecting to push an awful lot of functionality into these edge devices. Our imaginations don’t care about power, performance and cost; everything should be possible so let’s keep adding cool features. Of course reality has to intrude at some point; edge nodes often aren’t plugged into a wall socket or even into a mobile-phone-class battery. Power and recharge constraints (as well as cost) don’t necessarily mean our imagined products are unattainable but they do require more careful thought in how they might be architected.

Q:

HighChart Heatmap with JSON data

I am trying to integrate JSON specific data into a heatmap offered by highmaps/highcharts.
The example on 
Link to HeatMap Demo
shows how to use CSV approach to load the data. But I was not able to get it running with a JSON array. Can anyone provide an equivalent to the CSV from the example to get the same heatmap chart, or show me the way to another example based on JSON?
Thx in advance.
Cheers Peter

A:

You need to convert that to the col/row point instead of date string. You are going to have 2 category axis: x and y. Then the index of x/y axis becomes the [x, y, value]. So, if your data starts on "2013-04-01" then it is your first index such that [ ["2013-04-01",0,-0.7], ["2013-04-02",0,-3.4], ["2013-04-03",0,-1.1] ] becomes:
[ [0,0,-0.7], [1,0,-3.4], [2,0,-1.1] ]

Note that this is just one row's worth of data. What is your y component?
EDIT:
If your yAxis component will be the hour of the day then you would set up your axii like so:
xAxis: {
    categories: ['2013-04-01', '2013-04-02', '2013-04-03'],
    labels: {
        rotation: 90
    }
},
yAxis: {
    title: {
        text: null
    },
    labels: {
        enabled: false
    },
    categories: ['Midnight', '1 am', '2 am', '3 am', '4 am', '5 am', '6 am', '7 am', '8 am', '9 am', '10 am', '11 am', 'Noon', '1 pm', '2 pm', '3 pm', '4 pm', '5 pm', '6 pm', '7 pm', '8 pm', '9 pm', '10 pm', '11 pm'],
    min: 0,
    max: 23,
    reversed: true
},

Then you series would look something like:
series: [{
    borderWidth: 0,
    nullColor: '#EFEFEF',
    data: [ [0,0,-0.7], [1,0,-3.4], [2,0,-1.1] ]
}]

Live demo.
There are other items I added there that I will let you figure out (why do I set reversed: true, what is the colorAxis, etc). The important thing to note is that the series.data format is different from any other highchart setup.

Border Awareness Experience

Understanding the US/Mexico Border through experiential education

Annunciation House has been working in El Paso/Ciudad Juarez since 1978 operating houses of hospitality for migrants and refugees. Annunciation House is a Catholic organization that accompanies the migrant, homeless, and economically vulnerable peoples of the border region through hospitality, advocacy, and education. It has an all volunteer staff who place themselves among these poor so as transform their understanding of what constitutes more just relationships between peoples, countries, and economies.

In the early 1990s Annunciation House developed the Border Awareness Experience (BAE). The objective of the BAE is to facilitate face to face meetings and encounters between participants and people and groups on both sides of the border. It intends to raise consciousness about the issues facing the border such as immigration, economic development, human rights, and social justice. The BAE also educates North Americans about our role and responsibilities in today’s globalized world.

The US/Mexico border is a unique are where the ‘First World’ meets the ‘Third World’. It is a region where multiple factors (social, political, economic, cultural, environmental) come into play. It is worth understanding for its own intrinsic value, but perhaps more importantly, we can learn much by seeing the border as a microcosm of today’s globalized economy.

The El Paso and Ciudad Juarez metropolitan area is the biggest border community in the world. The combined population of both cities is close to 3 million people. Since 1964 Juarez has experienced enormous population growth due to the influx of maquiladora factories. These factories have provided jobs but also caused various social problems that afflict the city. El Paso and Ciudad Juarez are also one of the main entry points into the US for undocumented workers and drugs.

The BAE is an immersion experience. More than being an informational tour, it seeks to immerse the participants in the border culture and realities of the many people and groups that live and work here. The food that you will eat and the conditions which you will live in are as much a part of the experience as the people and groups that you will meet

What is a typical day on a BAE?

A typical day may include:

Visiting the US Border Patrol

Listening to the stories of migrants and refugees

Touring a maquiladora

Meeting human rights activists

Staying in a migrant shelter

A maquiladora in Ciudad Juarez

Other Information

All participants, regardless of faith, backgrounds, and beliefs are welcome.

Cost is $90 per person per day.

Pack lightly.

Accommodation is dormitory style.

Bedding is provided.

Three meals a day will be provided. Food is simple but filling.

texture are periodical changes of environmental temperature that are associated with the mode of operation of airconditioning systems applied in metrological laboratories. Temperature changes are the reason of appearing of additional waviness components in the measurement result. Research activities aiming at elimination of this type of error from measurement results have been conducted for a few years at the Department of Manufacturing Engineering and Metrology of the Kielce University of Technology. In order to separate the waviness resulting from periodical changes of environmental temperature various types of filters can be applied, including Gaussian filters, two-dimensional wavelet transform or Fast Fourier Transform algorithms. The paper presents up-to-date results of the analysis of the efficiency of individual filtration methods aiming at the correction of temperature error that appears when measuring surface texture with the use of contact methods.

Denied?

When I made the decision to quit my job in Los Angeles and relocate to the Midwest, I knew certain things wouldn't be easy. Since starting work after college, I hadn't given much thought to what it actually takes to get medical insurance coverage, since I was always eligible for the group plan at the company for which I worked.

I've made no secret on here of the fact that I struggle with anxiety, and sometimes a bit of depression. I was diagnosed in college and have spent a lot of years working with some great health care professionals to the point that I'm not constantly in therapy any more and my medication is simple and consistent. For the most part I don't wake up every day (or go to bed every night) really even thinking that I have a problem.

But try and apply for individual medical insurance these days, and it's a problem. When I quit my job in January I immediately went to apply for coverage at a large, well-known insurance company, which promised great individual coverage. Now I'm a moderately fit young woman. I fit into my weight percentile, I exercise a little (ok not enough, but I have no physical limitations), my blood pressure is normal and I don't smoke, use illegal substances or drink to excess. I'm young and healthy and you would think that I'd be an insurance company's dream.

But I knew it the minute I hit that part of the application: "Have you ever been treated for mental illness? If yes, please give us some additional information." My application came back denied. No rider, no offers of a different plan, nothing. DENIED.

It was then I learned why so much of America is not insured. It doesn't matter if you have money to pay the premiums (which is saying a lot since the premiums are VERY high). It doesn't matter if you're sick and need treatment and are willing to pay extra for that - in fact, it makes you worse off. You just can't get covered.

Now don't go thinking that I've not been covered by insurance for the last 6 months. I went ahead and enrolled in what I could: a catastrophic policy through my alumni association. It won't cover anything, unless I fall victim to a bus crash or a magician's slicing trick that goes awry, but I'm covered. Sort of.

But that policy is now coming to an end, and I find myself in a weird place again. I have no permanent employment yet, and though I'm getting married next month and the coverage on my fiance's insurance could be retroactive, it would appear I have a few months before I can reliably give a sigh of relief at being covered again.

So today I filled out another application for health coverage. I filled out the application completely, even though I know that the section on Mental Illness is once again going to be my doom. So here I sit, waiting again to be denied.

2 Comments:

I hate the insurance agencies. I had the same problem, only because I have back problems. I applied at 2 large insurers and got denied. And now, because I saw a therapist earlier in the year, I have panic disorder on my record too. So I'm screwed if I'm ever without a regular job.

There are options out there, but they're a lot like the Alumni option, they cover emergencies and that's it. It sucks, and it pisses me off. I'm sorry you've had to deal with it...

Boy, things like this just enrage me. At least you will have coverage, soon - and I guess I'm surprised that you got denied the first time if you had been insured within a time frame before applying for new insurance. (Sorry, my brain is kinda fried, but there's that law that won't allow them to use "pre-existing condition" if you've already been covered and treated before.) I think we'll ultimately reach a breaking point in this country, because health care can't be run as a for-profit business and still be accessible for all. Makes me so mad, how selfish we are with so much that we have and yet so many are without.

Jerry Brown (D) vetoed pending legislation requiring presidential candidates appearing on California’s ballot releasing their federal tax returns to the public.. Although the bill passed the Democratic-controlled legislature, Brown warned the measure could eventually lead to requirements of candidates to release other private information, such as health records or birth certificates.. “While I recognize the political attractiveness — even the merits — of getting President Trump’s tax returns, I worry about the political perils of individual states seeking to regulate the presidential elections in this manner. Will these requirements vary depending on which political party is in power?” the governor wrote in his veto message.. Sunday was the deadline for Brown to sign or veto this measure from the 2017 legislative session. The measure’s prime sponsor, state Sen. Mike McGuire (D) did not comment on the veto message.

Hoisted from that page's comments:

    
    
        However, due to the nature of the publications today, nobody is going to be honest and say: "You know what, we really thought that this advanced technique was going to be better. We tried our best, as you can see, but the improvement is really tiny." 
        There should be some credible way of reporting negative findings, which are surprising.
    

There are journals, such as the Journal of Negative Results (<http://www.jnr-
eeb.org/index.php/jnr>) for ecology, that do try to fill this gap. But they
don't have the same impact value.

This is fair enough, up to a point: you should be aiming for results that will
change the field.

I wonder if some of the benefits of simplicity come from the reduced
probability of making errors. I know that in my own research, I always try to
use simple methods or at least augment more complex methods with graphics and
simple methods.

That being said, I think it is useful to know the complex methods, even if you
don't use them.

Players welcomed into Newcastle United's Hall of Fame. Players past and present came together last night at St James’ Park to welcome the first inductees into the Newcastle United Foundation’s Hall of Fame.. Kevin Keegan's famous ‘Entertainers’ team were among the first to be recognised. They were represented by Alan Shearer, Rob Lee, Faustino Asprilla and John Beresford amongst others.. Shearer and Peter Beardsley were also inducted into the Hall of Fame individually, along with Fairs Cup-winning captain Bob Moncur.. Lady Elsie Robson attended the event and she said she was extremely proud as her husband, the late Sir Bobby, became the first manager in the Magpies' Hall of Fame.. There were also posthumous honours for Jackie Milburn and Hughie Gallacher, and recognition of Newcastle's great FA Cup winning team of the 1950's.

America's university president extraordinaire adds a new chapter and preface to The Uses of the University, probably the most important book on the modern university ever written. This summa on higher education brings the research university into the new century.. The multiversity that Clark Kerr so presciently discovered now finds itself in an age of apprehension with few certainties. Leaders of institutions of higher learning can be either hedgehogs or foxes in the new age. Kerr gives five general points of advice on what kinds of attitudes universities should adopt. He then gives a blueprint for action for foxes, suggesting that a few hedgehogs need to be around to protect university autonomy and the public weal.

Bell’s Smitten Golden Rye Ale Debuts In February ’13

With a new year comes to a new addition to the Bell’s seasonal spring lineup. In early February, Bell’s Smitten Golden Rye Ale will be released on draft and in six-packs – just in time to help transition into warmer days.

Coming in at 6% ABV, Smitten pours a hazy gold appearance.

“This is the perfect beer to help brighten those gray winter days and help warm your heart,” said Laura Bell, Marketing Director for Bell’s Brewery, Inc.

Drawn from one of Larry Bell’s oldest recipes, Smittenbegan as part of a series of rye beers at the Eccentric Café in downtown Kalamazoo, where a variety of new and old favorites are still brewed right next door at Bell’s original location.

That series also included Black Rye, Rye Stout and Kal-Haven Ale.

A combination of sharp citrus and resinous flavors from the Pacific Northwest hops with the earthy, rustic overtones of the rye malt yield an interesting and refreshing take on the American Pale Ale.

Formerly called Golden Rye Ale, Smitten is the first new regular bottle release since Oarsman Ale debuted as a year round offering in 2010.

For more information on where to find Smitten as well as other Bell’s beers, please visit the Bell’s Beer Finder online or contact your local retailer.

Playboy bunnies. Photo: David Becker/Getty Images for Playboy

Just over six months after its opening, the Playboy Club in New York City has reportedly fired half of its “Bunnies,” who had been hired to serve drinks and wait tables, and significantly slashed the remaining workers’ pay.

A source insinuated to “Page Six” that management focused more on women’s appearances than their qualifications for the job when hiring prospective Bunnies, and then failed to give them adequate training. But, instead of trained the women in basic hosting skills, the company laid off half of the Bunny staff and essentially demoted the rest.

“They have been stripped of their duty to wait on tables because they cannot do service,” a source said, adding that the remaining women had their pay slashed from $40 an hour to $25 an hour. “Bunnies are now allowed only to run drinks.”

Furthermore, a source told “Page Six” that new management was brought in to help with the transition, and new servers were hired. As to whether any of the old management staff were fired like the Bunnies, though, is unclear.

A spokesperson for club insisted that Playboy only has the best intentions for its employees. In a statement to “Page Six,” the spokesperson said that Playboy is “committed to creating a great experience for [its] growing number of members and dinner guests, as well as being a great place to work for all of our employees.”

Perhaps the recently unemployed Bunnies — as well as the remaining ones, who are now making a little over half of their initial wage in one of the most expensive cities in the world — would dispute this statement.

Random thoughts, musings, observations, & commentary on life

Points of Ponderation…..Episode 5.18

A semi-regular attempt to address some of life’s minutiae that might otherwise be overlooked…..

I don’t necessarily have a dog in the fight on this whole Roseanne Barr situation. I never watched the original incarnation of her sitcom, and wasn’t the least bit interested in the reboot. Her sense of humor just isn’t my cup o’ tea, and I was bemused by the support the new show received from my conservative friends. Roseanne Barr isn’t conservative…but of course I suppose the same thing can be said about President Trump, who has been all over the political map in his lifetime. I voted for Trump a) because I thought he was a better choice than Hillary Clinton, b) I’m all for “draining the swamp” and trying something new instead of the same ol’ out-of-touch politicians who aren’t the least bit interested in actually accomplishing anything meaningful, & c) I knew the hissy fit from the leftist elite in Hollywood, the media, & elsewhere would be delightfully entertaining. Having said all of that, it is undeniable that both manifestations of Roseanne were critically acclaimed & wildly popular, making ABC’s sudden decision to cancel based on a tweet from the titular star quite stunning. The cancellation doesn’t affect my life one way or another, but I am fascinated by the hypocrisy. Truly vile things are said daily on ABC’s daytime talk show The View, and that network’s own Jimmy Kimmel has been a huge contributor to making late night television unwatchable…but that’s okay because their politics toe the company line. In its statement about cancelling Roseanne ABC spouted off some kind of poppycock about her Twitter remarks not being consistent with their values. ABC & ESPN are both owned by Disney, and anyone who has been paying attention knows what those values are. The quick trigger finger displayed in this particular execution indicates that the powers-that-be were just looking for an excuse to cancel the show, just like the reasons given a year ago for axing Tim Allen’s conservative leaning sitcom Last Man Standing were weak at best. Another network probably won’t resuscitate Roseanne like they did Last Man Standing…especially since some of Roseanne Barr’s castmates have already thrown her under the bus…and I honestly couldn’t care less. I just think it’s sad that we’ve come to a point that everyone is so damn sensitive & phony.

Good information…..

What is the difference between a cookout, picnic, & barbeque?? Most of us use the terms interchangeably, but they do vary slightly. A picnic is a meal prepared or assembled in one place and enjoyed somewhere else…typically outdoors. Heck, sometimes one doesn’t even prepare the food themselves. Just hit the grocery store for some potato salad, baked beans, cole slaw, watermelon, & cold drinks, make a quick stop at KFC for a bucket of fried chicken, then head outside to your favorite spot…BOOM…picnic. Conversely, at a cookout the food is prepared on the spot and eaten right away. A cookout involves any kind of food that is cooked on a grill…burgers, hot dogs, chicken, veggies, steak, fish. It’s all good. A barbeque has a more narrow focus on food that is slow cooked…ribs, brisket, a whole pig or deer. At a picnic you’ll consume previously prepared chicken. At a cookout you might eat chicken breasts that have been grilled for 5 or 10 minutes. At a BBQ there’ll be a whole chicken that’s been smoked or roasted for hours.

Call it…validation…..

A couple of years ago I made a quiet promise to myself to refrain from sociopolitical “debates” on social media. It took me awhile to get the hang of it and for a time I still found myself engaging on occasion, with such “discussions” leaving me with nothing but elevated blood pressure & increased disdain for the human condition. However, this year I’ve been quite proud of myself, having passed on numerous opportunities to jump into the fray, and on the rare occasions when I do comment I keep my thoughts abbreviated & respectful. Last year…when I was still intermittently falling off the proverbial wagon…I “unfriended” & blocked someone who’d been a friend for over two decades. I realize that some may think of such an action as immature or silly, but for me it was a healthy choice. Unbeknownst to my old friend I unblocked him quite some time ago, and his privacy settings are such that I am able to lurk or troll. I recently ran across a lengthy thread on his page that confirmed to me that I had done the right thing. What this person does is purposely post inflammatory thoughts & opinions then sit back and enjoy the show. Inevitably there is atleast a person or two unable to stay within the lines of courteous & intelligent conversation, and that’s when the name calling, foul language, & even threats begin. And then my friend has the unmitigated gall to make a weak attempt at being the even-tempered, “can’t we all just get along” Voice of Reason. It’s a sick game that he’s been playing for years, deriving vile pleasure from all the attention he is receiving & the trouble he has stirred up, all the while trying to present himself as blameless & innocent. I look back at all the times that I fell into the trap, the instances when I was among those acting crazy & saying nasty things in the midst of the fray, and I am deeply ashamed. A person has the right to post what they want (within legal & decent parameters) on social media. That’s freedom of speech. That being said, others can choose if or how to react, and personally I have become more inclined to just keep scrolling. Your mileage may vary.

And that’s all I have to say about that.

Speaking of phony…..

I mentioned awhile back that I thought the “veracity of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movement(s)” were “almost mortally wounded” after a really stupid story about comedian Aziz Ansari. And now surely the death knell has to be sounded after a provably false accusation was made against legendary actor Morgan Freeman by an insipidly idiotic “reporter” on CNN. Here’s a tip ladies: if you’re going to slander someone…especially a person who is respected & revered by millions…you might want to make sure there aren’t any video cameras around. I’ve thought almost from the beginning that for every legit claim of “sexual misconduct” there were probably five more that were absolute nonsense, but of course most of the accusations have been from many years ago and had no witnesses one way or another, so far too many people fell into the trap of just believing the allegations of a “poor innocent victim”, and thus careers have been destroyed. Billy Joel once sang “she’ll carelessly cut you and laugh while you’re bleeding”, while Ricky Nelson crooned “she’d play around and tease me with her carefree devil eyes…she’d hold me close and kiss me but her heart was full of lies”. Men are finally getting fed up with the garbage being hurled at them by women. Pack a lunch ladies…it’s on like Donkey Kong!! I hope Freeman sues CNN into oblivion.

Thirteen.”. The Public Library Management Institute, started in 1995, is a three-year program for library directors who do not have master’s degrees.

Barcaple photographs. We had the most fabulous time on our residential trip to Barcaple, Abernethy. The weather couldn't have been kinder and the venue more beautiful.. The instructors were fantastic, ensuring that each day was filled with adventurous activity from morning tonight. We did such a wide range of things; abseiling, canoeing, mountain biking, ropes courses, climbing, raft building and archery to name but a few.. The children began each day with a hearty breakfast and then they were off! Each activity had a half time break for refreshments and then we continued until our pre-ordered lunches were ready. More activities in the afternoon followed by a huge tea then after some free time one of the instructors would lead a game. At nine o'clock it was time for a drink and homemade cake and then free time until bed. (We needed to do the activities to work off all the delicious food!)

The Reds only managed one win, against Plymouth in an FA Cup replay, last month - before ending their hoodoo at home to Tottenham last weekend.

And Germany international Can admits he found it difficult to ignore the haters but has backed Jurgen Klopp to fire the Reds towards a Champions League place.

Can told the Liverpool Echo : “It’s not easy to ignore what people are saying because you naturally tend to read the newspapers and speak to friends and a lot of people in the city.

"Of course they want to talk about football. It’s not easy to ignore, but we have to try and do that because it’s the best way to focus on the games ahead.

“The most important thing is we have to stick together. When we have good performances we stick together and we must do the same when we have bad performances.”

Adam Lallana revealed this week skipper Jordan Henderson called a players-only meeting to help rejuvenate the Reds ahead of the Tottenham clash.

And Can has told of Klopp holding his own get-togethers in an attempt to remind his squad of their potential.

“He is a very positive guy and has been encouraging us and trying to help us have a positive frame of mind so that everybody believes and thinks positively again,” said the Germany international.

“We have had a lot of meetings and he tries to motivate us because he also knows that we cannot forget the good times we have had this season.

“We are fifth in the league – one points off fourth – which is not too bad in a strong league.

“We know how quickly things can turn around in football. We have to stay together, be one team and look forward.

“Of course, after we had so many good times in the first half of the season, nobody thought that we would have a spell (like we had). I think we can learn a lot from the past month and come back stronger.

“(The target has) always been to finish in the top four of the Premier League as we want to play in the Champions League next year. When you play for Liverpool, playing in the Champions League is always the target.”

Liverpool are without a game until the scheduled trip to Leicester City on Monday week, and head to La Manga tomorrow for a five-day training camp.

“It’s different of course because now we have more time to train,” said Can, speaking to the official Liverpool matchday programme. “I’m sure we will make the opportunity to spend that time working on different things to try and improve.

“But as a player you’d always much rather be playing more games. Training is good but I prefer going out to play matches with the amazing support of our fans behind us.”

The skin is composed of the epidermis, an epithelial layer of ectodermal origin, and the dermis, a layer of connective tissue of mesodermal origin. See generally Fitzpatrick (1999) Dermatology in General Medicine, 5th ed., McGraw Hill. The junction of dermis and epidermis is mostly irregular, and projections of the dermis, known as papillae, interdigitate with evaginations of the epidermis known as epidermal ridges.
The epidermis consists mainly of a stratified keratinized epithelium populated primarily by keratinocytes, which are keratinizing epidermal cells. See id. The epidermis also harbors a number of other cell populations such as melanocytes, Langerhans cells, Merkel cells, and other cellular migrants. From the dermis outward, the epidermis consists of five layers of keratinocytes known as the stratum basale (stratum germinativum), stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum lucidum and stratum corneum.
The dermis is composed of the connective tissue that supports the epidermis and binds it to the subjacent layer, known as subcutaneous tissue or hypodermis. See id. The dermis has a rich network of blood and lymph vessels. The dermis contains vascular networks situated in parallel to the skin surface at various levels and connected by vertical communicating vessels. The dermis contains two layers with rather indistinct boundaries: the outermost papillary layer and the deeper reticular layer. The papillary layer is composed of a number of different cell types, including loose connective tissue cells, fibroblasts and other connective tissue cells, as well as mast cells and macrophages. Extravasated leukocytes are also detected in the papillary layer. The reticular layer is thicker than the papillary layer and is composed of irregular dense connective tissue (mainly type I collagen).
Many pathologic reactions of the skin involve a combination of epidermal and dermal components. See id. However, frequently one component is more predominantly involved in a given pathological reaction over the other, thus leading to certain clinical diagnoses. See id. For example, a hyperplastic epidermis is characteristic of psoriatic plaques. Examples of pathologic reactions involving superficial skin layers include vesicular dermitis (eczema), contact dermatitis, psoriasis, interface dermatitis, erythema multiforme, lupus erythematosus, lichen planus and dermatitis herpetiformis. Examples of pathologic reactions involving the dermis include acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet's Syndrome), erythema elevatum diutinum, cutaneous eosinophilic disease, granuloma, malignant atrophic papulosis, dermal neoplasm, dermal pseudoneoplasm, dermal hyperplasia, dermal vascular anomaly, Kaposi's sarcoma, anetoderma and atrophic disorder of the skin.
Skin disorders, such as psoriasis, eczema, and lichen planus, are known to affect one to two percent of the U.S. population, with as many as 150,000–260,000 new cases occurring annually (“Research Needs in 11 Major Areas in Dermatology” I. Psoriasis. J. Invest. Dermatol. 73:402–13, 1979). Presently known therapies for the above mentioned skin diseases are limited. Steroids or cyclosporin A are commonly used in the treatment of psoriasis, lichen planus, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, UV damage, pyoderma gangrenosum, vitiligo, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, alopecia areata, allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and cutaneous T cell lymphoma. In addition, for some of these skin conditions, various therapies include retinoids, PUVA, nitrogen mustard, interferon, chemotherapy, methotrexate, light therapy (e.g., UV light and PUVA), antibiotics and antihistamines. See id. UV light therapies, both UVA and UVB therapy, expose the skin to UV radiation between 320–400 nm (UVA radiation) and 290–320 nm (UVB radiation). PUVA therapy is a form of photochemotherapy that involves repeated topical application of psoralen or a psoralen-based compound to an affected region of skin, followed by exposure of that region to UVA radiation. Another method used to treat proliferative skin diseases, particularly psoriasis and mycosis fungoides, is photodynamic therapy (PDT).
Side effects to these therapies are known. Most commonly encountered drawbacks for cyclosporin A include toxicity due to immunosuppression and renal and neural toxicity. Steroids have well known side effects including induction of Cushing Syndrome. Side effects of certain of the other aforementioned therapies include skin cancer, bone marrow and constitutional toxicities, ligament calcification, liver fibrosis and other disorders. With respect to light therapy, prolonged treatment of skin diseases using these types of therapies can result in significant acute and chronic adverse effects including erythema, pruritus, skin cancer, and chronic light-induced damage of the skin (Stem et al. (1979) N.E. J. of Med. 300:809–812).
Accordingly, there exists a need for improved therapeutic modalities for preventing and treating skin disorders.

Coronavirus: Argentina bans commercial flight sales until 1 September Published duration 27 April Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic

image copyright Getty Images image caption Argentina has been on lockdown since 20 March, grounding many flights

Argentina has banned all internal and international commercial flights until 1 September because of the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

The authorities said airlines should not be allowed to sell tickets for flights that may not go ahead in the next four months.

Aviation industry groups said thousands of people could lose their jobs.

Argentina closed its borders to non-residents in March, imposing tough quarantine measures.

The country currently has nearly 4,000 confirmed infections, with 192 deaths, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.

What did the Argentine government say?

The country's National Civil Aviation Administration issued a decree on Monday, banning ticket sales for commercial flights to, from or within Argentina.

It described 1 September as a "reasonable" date.

The agency added that the decree was aimed at preventing airlines from ticketing flights not approved by the Argentine authorities.

What has the reaction been?

The international aviation agency, Iata, sent a letter to the Argentine government, saying the decision breached bilateral agreements and put at risk more than 300,000 jobs in the country.

Meanwhile, Alta, a group which lobbies interests of Latin American and Caribbean airlines, said the decree was not "agreed with the industry".

Many countries in South America have halted commercial flights, but none has extended the ban for as long as Argentina.

From Elton Alexander, The Plain Dealer, Cleveland.com:. “The Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course is unlike most circuits on the IndyCar series in that it is a 2.4-mile, 15-turn permanent road course, able to hold races for everything from motorcycles to trucks, with sports cars, IndyCars and NASCAR Xfinity in between. It’s also a popular site for engine and tire tests.. Earlier this week, I took a tour of the course with Nate Stacy, at 16 the youngest driver on the Pirelli World Challenge GTS. We rode in his new Mustang Boss 302s, reaching speeds up to 140 miles per hour in stretches, then practically coming to a dead stop, dropping almost immediately to 5-10 mph for turns in some corners.”.

Editorial: The Marja test

Monday

Feb 22, 2010 at 12:01 AMFeb 22, 2010 at 9:16 PM

For months, President Obama and his advisers labored to come up with a successful strategy for Afghanistan. That strategy is now being put to the test in Marja, a Taliban stronghold in Helmand Province, and Americans should pay attention.

For months, President Obama and his advisers labored to come up with a successful strategy for Afghanistan. That strategy is now being put to the test in Marja, a Taliban stronghold in Helmand Province, and Americans should pay attention.

The Marja offensive is the biggest operation since the battle of Fallujah, a comparison Gen. Stanley McChrystal, commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, resists. Marines fought their way into Fallujah in April 2004, a low point for U.S. troops in the Iraq war, then left it to the Iraqis. Seven months later, U.S. troops again had to storm Fallujah, with great destruction and loss of life, because it had become a center of the Iraqi resistance in Anbar Province.

"We don't want Fallujah," McChrystal told The New York Times as Marines entered Marja. "Fallujah is not the model."

McChrystal's new model is one where troops make every effort to minimize destruction and loss of life, particularly civilian deaths. The test is what happens after the territory has been secured, he says. With that in mind, McChrystal has what he calls a "government in a box" Afghan civil servants, foreign advisers and Afghan police ready to set up shop in Marja as soon as the Marines have cleared out the Taliban.

Success in war is all about tactical adaptation, and the Taliban are already adapting, using more human shields for protection. Even without those tactics, civilian deaths are unavoidable. While there is no moral equivalence between civilians accidentally killed by NATO troops targeting Taliban soldiers and Afghan civilians targeted by Taliban suicide bombers, a force of outsiders must meet a higher standard if it is to win the trust of the Afghan people.

If NATO troops can secure, hold and build in Marja, the model will be applied elsewhere and the Taliban's grip on Afghanistan's rural areas will slip. But the degree of difficulty is huge, and requires U.S. troops to change the way they approach their jobs.

"The population is not the enemy," Marine Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson told the Times, "The population is the prize."

Polls indicate most Americans just want the troops to come home. All should be pulling for McChrystal's strategy to succeed.

The Man with No Name. When I was a young warthog…. When he was a young warthooooooggggg!. As a younger lad, I loved sarsaparillas. I discovered it when my family was on a road trip through the southwestern United States, when I was only seven. In the same vein as ordering a root beer, a kid kind of felt like they were drinking with the big boys… all grown up. Especially on this road trip, it was fun to saddle up to a ghost town bar and ask the tender for a sarsaparilla. Take a big swig of it to show everyone in the joint that you’re a badass and then take your seat at a table for a round of poker.. In reality, my parents probably ordered me the sarsaparilla, in a family establishment, and I likely had chicken fingers for dinner, while colouring one of those kid’s menus..

A group for local breeders of the Lleyn variety of sheep held their first open day last week.. The North and East of England Lleyn Sheep Breeders Group held the event at Holme Farm, Kelby, on Sunday, August 23.. The farm is home to a flock of 500 Lleyn ewes, with 200 pure bred to provide replacements and pedigree females for sale.. Livestock manager Daniel Rowbottom, pictured with his shearling rams, said it went well with 30 to 40 visitors, a mixture of established breeders and those interested in starting out.. He explained it was mainly an educational event for people interested in the breed, saying: “It was to promote the breed of sheep, to give people more information about what we do, how we farm, and what we produce.”. The free open day saw visitors treated to a tour of the sheep and cattle, a demonstration on what to look for in ram lambs, and a stock judging competition.

Although political repression was happening before the coup (Military disappearing people and killing), it was also heavily extended after the coup ended. The result of those years were more than 30,000 people forced disappearances. Many others were also killed.

The coup had been planned since October 1975, and the United States Department of State learned of the preparations two months before its execution.[2] The American secretary of stateHenry Kissinger would meet several times with Argentinian military leaders after the coup, urging them to destroy their opponents quickly before outcry over human rights abuses grew in the United States.[3]

President Juan Perón died on July 1, 1974. He was succeeded by his wife María Estela Martínez de Perón, affectionately called "Isabelita." Despite her claim as the country's rightful ruler, María rapidly lost political influence and power. A group of military officials, tasked by Perón himself to aide María, took control in an effort to revitalize Argentina's deteriorating political and social climate. This shift in governance paved the way for the ensuing coup.

On February 5, 1975 Operativo Independencia was launched. This Vietnam-style intervention aimed to eliminate the guerrillas in the Tucumán jungle, who had maintained strongholds in the area as early as May 1974. In October the country was divided into five military zones, with each commander given full autonomy to unleash a carefully planned wave of repression.

On December 18, a number of warplanes took off from Morón Air Base and strafed the Casa Rosada in an attempt to overthrow Isabel Perón. The rebellion was brought to a halt four days later through arbitration by a chaplain.

However, the military did succeed in removing the only officer remaining loyal to the government, Air Force commander Héctor Fautario. Fautario drew harsh criticism from the Army and Navy owing to his vehement opposition to their repressive plans, and for his refusal to mobilize the Air Force against the guerrillas' strongholds in the north. Fautario was Videla's final obstacle in his pursuit of power.

By January 1976 the guerrilla presence in Tucumán had been reduced to a few platoons. In the meanwhile, the military, fully backed by the local élite and the United States, bided its time before ultimately seizing power.[3][4]

Shortly before 01:00 am, President Martínez de Perón was detained and taken by helicopter to the El Messidor residence. At 03:10 all television and radio stations were interrupted. Regular transmissions were cut and replaced by a military march, after which the first communiqué was broadcast:

"[...] People are advised that as of today, the country is under the operational control of the Joint Chiefs General of the Armed Forces. We recommend to all inhabitants strict compliance with the provisions and directives emanating from the military, security or police authorities, and to be extremely careful to avoid individual or group actions and attitudes that may require drastic intervention from the operating personnel. Signed: General Jorge Rafael Videla, Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera and Brigadier Orlando Ramón Agosti."

A state of siege and martial law were implemented, as military patrolling spread to every major city. The morning was seemingly uneventful, but as the day progressed, the detentions multiplied. Hundreds of workers, unionists, students, and political activists were abducted from their homes, their workplaces, or in the streets.

Human rights activists state that in the aftermath of the coup and ensuing Dirty War, some 30,000 people, primarily young opponents of the military regime, were "disappeared" or killed.[5] Military men responsible for the killings often spared pregnant women for a time, keeping them in custody until they gave birth, before killing them and giving their infants to childless military families.[5] Kissinger privately assured the military regime that they would have the full support of the United States government in their war and associated actions, a promise that was opposed by the U.S. Ambassador to Argentina at the time, Robert Hill.[3]

While science has traditionally been done behind closed doors, the increasing power of technology to alter our shared environment makes it imperative for us to switch to an open and community-driven process.

Responsive Science uses PubPub, an interface developed at the MIT Media Lab, to provide a platform for researchers to share their scientific goals and progress with the communities that may one day be impacted by their research. By actively inviting concerns and criticism from local citizens at the very beginning of each project, technologies can be redesigned to more effectively address societal needs.

We encourage scientists to post their grants, papers and proposals and begin discussions in order to make science faster, safer, and responsive to everyone.

RNA-guided gene drive elements could address many ecological problems by altering the traits of wild organisms, but the likelihood of global spread tremendously complicates ethical development and use. Here we detail a localized form of CRISPR-based gene drive.

Abstract

The last two decades have witnessed an intensifying
effort in learning how to manage flow turbulence: it has in
fact now become one of the most challenging and prized technological goals in fluid dynamics. The goal itself is of course not new. More than a hundred years ago, Reynolds already listed factors conducive to laminar and to turbulent flow (including among them curvature and acceleration). Furthermore, it is in retrospect clear that there were several early instances of successful turbulence management. Examples are the reduction in drag achieved with a ring-trip placed on the front of a sphere or the insertion of a splitter-plate behind a circular cylinder; by the early 1950s there were numerous exercises at boundary layer control. Although many of these studies were interesting and suggestive, they led to no spectacularly successful practical application, and the effort petered out in the late 1950s.

Neo-Fascist Beaten to a Pulp as Italy’s Dark Past Roils Campaign

Italians go to the polls on March 4 with voters divided over the country’s relationship with the European Union, taxes and immigration. Here’s your daily guide to the latest news.

The regional leader of a neo-fascist party was assaulted, a far-left activist stabbed, and a memorial to policemen murdered by Marxist radicals was daubed with a swastika and threatening graffiti.

A string of violent episodes yesterday cast a shadow over the campaign just 10 days before the vote. For older Italians, the headlines served as a reminder of the dark days of the 70s and 80s when Italy was rocked by hundreds of killings, bombings and kidnappings by politically-motivated groups.

Violence has already marred this election when the grisly murder of a young woman in central Italy, apparently by a Nigerian drug dealer, sparked a drive-by shooting of immigrants earlier this month.

Roberto Fiore, leader of Forza Nuova, said his party will continue campaigning despite the attack on its regional organizer in Sicily and insisted the immigrant attack was “unforgivable.” “What have I got to do with that? I'm not Hitler,” he said in an interview with Corriere della Sera. “I was never a Nazi. But Fascist, yes.”

The Italian establishment is closing ranks. As John Follain reports, President Sergio Matterella won’t ask the populist Five Star Movement to form a government unless it secures an unexpected majority – even though it’s set to be the biggest single party.

Former President Giorgio Napolitano gave a ringing endorsement of center-left Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. But Gentiloni – a reassuring presence for investors and fellow European leaders – saw his chances of staying in power recede yesterday with both Silvio Berlusconi and Matteo Renzi, Gentiloni’s party chief, ruling out another grand coalition.

Italy’s humongous debt is one thing investors don’t have to worry about – at least in the short term. I’ve done a piece on how careful management by the Treasury means its 2.3 trillion euros of liabilities should be protected from volatility following the vote.

Quote of the day:“There’s too much silence on this. The Mafia can influence the institutions and politics.” Interior minister Marco Minniti on the threat of organized crime

Other candidates are scrambling for votes, but Berlusconi canceled two campaign rallies yesterday. Il Mattino reported that his daughter Marina asked the 81-year-old not to push himself too hard. But you have to wonder: Is he losing steam or does he think he has victory in the bag? His coalition was eight points up before the polling blackout.

Czech models in political ads is an embarrassing revelation for Northern League leader Matteo Salvini – his campaign is supposed to be all about putting Italy first.

Who’s tweeting: Berlusconi says that, sure, he can’t be prime minister but he is “more than happy to be the coach. I think I am more effective from the touchline.”

Posted by Stella on 31st Aug 2014. When I started using this cable I had a problem as it was difficult for me to fix it. Am not very good in electronic device related matters and I thought the cable was faulty. I contacted the provider and their response was immediate and a technician instructed me on how to make use of the cable and guided me to connect it. What I thought was a waste of money turned up to be the most reliable cable for my work. It works efficiently allowing transfer of data and swift command of tasks from the device. It is multipurpose and I find it easy to use after understanding how to connect it. The cable cord is coated with a plastic material that does not crack easily even when I fold it so that it can fit in my bag as I go to work an assurance that it is durable. My advice is, do not be afraid to buy yours!

A promising, environmentally safe method for inactivating fungal spores of Penicillium digitatum, a difficult-to-inactivate food spoilage microorganism, was developed using a high-density nonequilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma (NEAPP). The NEAPP employing Ar gas had a high electron density on the order of 10(15) cm(-3). The spores were successfully and rapidly inactivated using the NEAPP, with a decimal reduction time in spores (D value) of 1.7 min. The contributions of ozone and UV radiation on the inactivation of the spores were evaluated and concluded to be not dominant, which was fundamentally different from the conventional sterilizations.

Rabbi Shlomo Aviner answers hundreds of text message questions a week. Some appear in the parashah sheets "Ma'ayanei Ha-Yeshu'ah" and "Olam Ha-Katan." Here's a sample:Q: I feel that there is no love between my parents, and it hurts me. If I point it out to my mother I think she will be angry. What should I do?A: It is worthwhile to ask your mother and talk about it.Q: When I was a kid I stole 20 shekels from a store and I now regret it.

Frontex’s staff of ten thousand is not enough to handle a major migration movement

April 18, 2019 2:49 PM

“The ten thousand staff of the European Union’s Border and Coast Guard Agency Frontex is very little in the case of a major migration movement”, Chief Security Advisor to the Prime Minister György Bakondi said on Hungarian M1 television’s Thursday morning current affairs program.

Mr. Bakondi said that according to the treaty on the reinforcement of Frontex adopted by the European Parliament (EP) on Wednesday, the organisation’s staff will first be increased to five thousand, and later to ten thousand.

He said it was fortunate that the condition objected to by Hungary, according to which Frontex would also be able to take action without the authorisation of the given member state in case of major trouble, was not included in the agreement. “This issue would have had serious effects with relation to sovereignty”, he added.

“The decision is part of the European Union election campaign, because its implementation will occur during the next parliamentary cycle”, the Chief Security Advisor declared. “In recent months, the EP has done everything in its power to establish an irreversible legal environment that supports the pro-immigration forces”, he added.

“If the European Parliament has a different make-up following the elections, and there are anti-immigration politicians in the European Union’s leading institutions, it will become possible to make decisions that conform to the European people’s demand for security”, Mr. Bakondi explained.

The number of people arriving has increased on all migration routes, and the numbers are expected to increase further during the summer, the Chief Security Advisor said.

Evaluation of various sources of corn dried distillers grains plus solubles for lactating dairy cattle.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of feeding dried distillers grains plus solubles (DDGS) from different sources on milk production and composition in dairy cows. Eight multiparous and 4 primiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design with 28-d periods. Treatments consisted of total mixed diets containing no DDGS (CON), or DDGS from source 1 (DDGS-1), source 2 (DDGS-2), or source 3 (DDGS-3) at 20% of diet dry matter. The processing of DDGS-2 and DDGS-3 was intended to decrease heat damage and improve nutritional quality. The DDGS in the diets replaced a portion of the ground corn and soybean meal, allowing them to be isonitrogenous at 16% crude protein. All diets had a forage-to-concentrate ratio of 55:45. Dry matter intake (21.4 kg/d) did not differ among diets, but cows fed diets containing DDGS had greater yields of milk (34.6 vs. 31.2 kg/d), 4% fat-corrected milk (32.7 vs. 29.6 kg/d), and energy-corrected milk (35.4 vs. 32.3) compared with cows fed the CON diet. Feed efficiency was greater in cows fed DDGS compared with CON (1.78 vs. 1.63). Milk fat yield was greater in cows fed DDGS compared with those fed CON (1.26 vs. 1.14 kg/d). Milk protein percentages (3.28, 3.13, 3.19, and 3.17% for CON, DDGS-1, DDGS-2, and DDGS-3, respectively) were greater for CON vs. DDGS and tended to be lower for DDGS-1 than for DDGS-2 and DDGS-3. Milk protein yields tended to be greater for cows fed DDGS than for those fed CON (1.09 vs. 1.02 kg/d). Concentrations of milk urea nitrogen were lower in cows fed DDGS compared with CON (9.36 vs. 10.6 mg/dL). Feeding DDGS decreased arterial plasma concentrations of Arg, Ile, Lys, and Thr and increased His and Leu compared with CON. Arterial plasma from cows fed DDGS-2 and DDGS-3 had greater concentrations of Ile, Trp, and Val compared with DDGS-1. In all diets, Lys, Met, and Phe were the first 3 limiting amino acids for protein synthesis with Lys being first limiting in DDGS-1 and DDGS-3 and Met being first limiting for CON and DDGS-2. Inclusion of DDGS did not affect the molar proportions of ruminal acetate or propionate compared with CON. Ruminal proportions of butyrate were lower in CON compared with DDGS. Total concentrations of VFA were greater in CON compared with DDGS. The concentrations of rumen ammonia were greater in CON (7.2 mg/dL) compared with DDGS (4.5 mg/dL). Overall, the source of DDGS used in this study did not affect lactation performance.

Q:

which of the following is/are algebraic over rationals

which of the following is/are true?

$\sin 7^\circ$ is an algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$
$\sin^{-1}(1)$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$
$\cos (\pi/7)$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$
$\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{\pi} $ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$

an algebraic number is a number that is a root of a non-zero polynomial in one variable with rational coefficients, I am perfectly sure that option $1$, $3$ are  algebraic number. could any one help me to find out others option?

A:

For option 2:
Evaluate $\sin^{-1}(1)$. It's easy
For $4$:
$\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{\pi}$ satisfies is a root of the equation:
$$(x^2-2-\pi)^2-2\pi=0$$
$$x^4-2(2+\pi)x^2+(\pi+2)^2-2\pi=0$$
$$x^4-(4+2\pi)x^2+\pi^2+2\pi+4=0$$
Hence $\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{\pi}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$

Here I will include the proofs of 2 useful facts:
Fact 1: Let $E$ be an extension field of a field $F$. Let $u\in E$. Then $u$
 is algebraic over $F$ iff $F(u)$ is finite dimesnsional over $F$.
Proof: 
Forward direction: Consider the elements $1,u,u^2,...u^{[F(u):F]}$. If these $[F(u):F]+1$ elements were linearly independent over $F$, then the dimension of $F(u)$ over $F$ must be greater than or equal to $[F(u):F]+1$ (contradiction). Thus, we conclude that they are linearly dependent. Hence there exists $a_0,a_1,....,a_{[F(u):F]}\in F$ such that not all of thm are zero and:
$$a_{[F(u):F]}u^{[F(u):F]}+a_{[F(u):F]-1}u^{[F(u):F]-1}+...+a_1u+a_0=0$$
Hence $u$ is algebraic over $F$.
Backward direction: We start by showing that $F(u)=F[u]$. Clearly, $F[u]\subseteq F(u)$. Since $F(u)$ is the intersection of all subfields that contain $F\cup\{u\}$., therefore $F(u)\subseteq F[u]$ if $F[u]$. Now we verify that $F[u]$ is a field. Consider the  ring homomorphism $\phi: F[x]\rightarrow F(u)$ that sends $p(x)$ to $p(u)$. It can be shown that $\phi$ is surjective. Hence $F[u]\cong F[x]/Ker\phi$.    $Ker\phi=\{p(x)\in F[x]|p(u)=0\}$. Since $F$ is a field, therefore $F[x]$ is a PID. Since $Ker\phi$ is an ideal of $F[x]$, therefore $Ker\phi=(f(x))$ for some $f(x)\in F[x]$. It can be easily verified that $(f(u))$ is a prime ideal of $F[x]$. Since $F[x]$ is a PID, therefore $Ker\phi=(f(x))$ is a maximal ideal of $F[x]$. Hence $F[u]\cong F[x]/Ker\phi$ is a field. Thus $F(u)=F[u]$. Verify that $\{1,u,u^2,...,u^{deg(f)-1}\}$ is a basis for $F[u]$ over $F$. Hence, $F(u)=F[u]$ is a finite dimensional vector space over $F$.
Fact 2: Let $E$ be an extension field of a field $F$. Let $K:=\{x\in E|x$ is algebraic over$F\}$. Then $K$ is a field.
Proof: Let $x,y$ be algebraic over $F$. By fact 1, we deduce that $F(x)$ is finite dimensional over $F$. Since $y$ is algebraic over $F$, therefore $y$ is algebraic over $F(x)$. Thus, by fact 1 we deduce that $F(x)(y)$ is finite dimensional over $F(x)$. Since $F(x)$ is finite dimensional over $F$. Hence $F(x)(y)$ is finite dimensional over $F$. Since $x+y\in F(x)(y)$, therefore $F(x+y)$ is a subfield of $F(x)(y)$. Thus, $F(x+y)$ is finite dimensional over $F$. By fact 1, we deduce that $x+y$ is algebraic over $F$. Hence it is an element of $K$. The rest of the field axioms can be verified for $K$ similarly.

Since $\sqrt{2}$ is algebraic over $Q$, therefore it is algebraic over $Q[\pi]$. Similarly, $\sqrt{\pi}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}[\pi]$ (as it is the root of the equation $x^2-\pi=0$). Thus, we know that $\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{\pi}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}[\pi]$ by fact 2.

In 2001 he won a Goldman Environmental Prize.. Mr. President:. The greatest survival challenge facing humans is clean water. Though enough water exists, the lack of its efficient distribution has influenced business to see it as a "market" that can create profits from the universal human right to have sufficient water each day. I would like to ask you to create a fund to solve the world's water problems.. Your country spends much of its money supporting and fomenting war, which only creates death and desperation for the world's children, women, and elderly. Channel the money your country spends on arms and war into the bodies of all the world's children by guaranteeing them enough water for life.

“Sonia Machanick (15 June 1925 – 12 November 1977) was a South African medical doctor, author and educational psychologist who pioneered new methods of teaching children with dyslexia and other learning difficulties. She founded Japari School,[1] a special school in Johannesburg that provides education for children who struggle to thrive in the mainstream education system. She wrote a series of four graded reading books (Sounds Travel Too) and other reading tutors in English and Afrikaans (Tom Kan Lees)[2] that were widely used throughout the 1960s and 1970s[3] for teaching the phonics reading method, as well as articles concerning the treatment of children with learning difficulties.[4]” From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

A close friend recently told me something in strict confidence, something she'd never want her DH to know. This secret is totally safe with me, and I don't plan on telling anyone (including my DH).. Can you keep things like this to yourself, or do you pretty much divulge everything to your other half?. I recall a thread a few years back where some people thought that if a friend tells you something in confidence, that they should assume you would tell your partner. Whilst I tell my DH pretty much everything, I believe that if a friend tells you something they strictly want kept private, it should be assumed you keep it to yourself.. Thoughts?

JENSEN LAB. DG: using this measurement we can calculate growth rates. In some experiments, using Tg(hsp70:HA-mCherryTM), we can also measure shedding rates.. Basic questions about outer segment renewal remain:. • What is the growth molecular machinery that adds new material at the base of outer segment. • How do photoreceptors ‘know’ how much material to add daily?. • Is growth mostly constitutive or is it tightly regulated?. • What is the shedding molecular machinery that daily sheds chunks of distal outer segments?. • Is there an outer segment length set-point? If so, what molecules determine the set-point?. • Are the processes of growth and shedding coordinately regulated?. • Does deregulation of the renewal process contribute to retinal disease?

Women (N = 16) were equally divided into two groups; one taking oral contraception (for at least six months) and the other not. Ss were tested on three occasions (menses, mid-cycle, and luteal phase). Each S performed one maximal isotonic strength test (1 RM) of the leg extensors. Each performed a test to exhaustion at 50% of 1 RM on each phase-test. EMG electrodes were placed on the rectus femoris.

Fatigue was significantly increased for both groups during ovulation.

A history of brain injury raises a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s disease, and many researchers now suspect that the brain’s inflammatory responses to injury may magnify the neurodegenerative process. Now researchers have identified a substance that could explain how inflammation leads to the formation of amyloid plaques, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease.

Lennart Mucke and colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco, report that a substance called transforming growth factor TGF-β1 induces the accumulation of amyloid deposits in the cerebral blood vessels and meninges in aged transgenic mice that overexpress the substance. TGF-β1 is normally produced by brain cells in response to injury or infection. Mucke’s team report that transgenic mice expressing both excess TGF-β1 and a mutant form of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which causes an inherited form of Alzheimer’s disease, developed amyloid deposits by the age of two to three months. In contrast, animals that express only the mutant APP developed the deposits at six to eight months. In human Alzheimer's patients, levels of TGF-β1 in brain tissue are higher than in normal subjects.

The findings are reported in the 9 October 1997 issue of Nature.—June Kinoshita

Assisted suicide: factors affecting public attitudes.
Public support for assisted suicide has been growing despite the ethical questions raised by members of the medical profession. Previous research suggests that age, gender, experience, and religiosity are factors affecting individuals' attitudes. This study examines the effect of demographic and ideological factors, as well as individuals' caregiving experiences, on attitudes toward assisted suicide. Random-digit-dialing procedures produced a sample of 156 residents of Denton, Texas, in March 1998. T-tests were conducted to measure significance, while gamma values were used to measure level of association and percent reduction in error. The data indicate that age, gender, and caregiving experience were not significant predictors of attitudes. Situational factors, including whether a physician or friend/family member should assist and whether a child or a terminally ill patient experiencing no pain should receive assistance, all were highly significant and positively associated with attitudes toward assisted suicide. Respondents were most likely to support physician-assisted suicide for individuals experiencing no pain. The data also indicated that the depth of commitment to the beliefs that suffering has meaning, that life belongs to God, and that physician-assisted suicide is murder, were highly significant and negatively associated with attitudes toward assisted suicide.

Zuma asks South Africa's ANC to keep him as leader

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South African President Jacob Zuma acknowledged Sunday that corruption and violence have marred the image of the African National Congress under his watch, but called on members to again support him to be the political party's leader.

The ANC, once a liberation movement that started a century ago to fight apartheid, has been governing South Africa for 18 years and faces increasing criticism in this nation of 50 million people that's the continent's top economy. Some 4,000 delegates gathered Sunday for the start of the party's Mangaung conference, being held in the city also known as Bloemfontein, and listened to Zuma offer occasionally candid comments about the party's issues. Still, Zuma made promises and said his government remained on track to change South Africa, attempting to appeal to delegates who will decide whether Zuma or his quiet deputy Kgalema Motlanthe should take charge of the party. And while Zuma long has been trailed by corruption allegations and questions about his personal life, he remains the favorite among delegates to lead the party and likely become South Africa's president after the nation's 2014 elections.

"We want to dismiss the perceptions that the country is falling apart," Zuma said in his speech televised live across the country. However, he later admitted: "The challenges we face — unemployment, poverty and inequality — are South African in their origin, and are deep and structural."

The ANC remains the dominant political force in post-apartheid South Africa and opposition parties don't receive the same support at the polls, meaning whomever is named president of party will more than likely become the nation's next president. However, South Africa has seen credit downgrades in recent months, as well as violent protests across its mining industry that saw about 46 people killed at a Marikana platinum mine, most by police.

In his more than one hour and a half speech, Zuma called the violence at Marikana an "indictment" of the ANC for not being there for the miners. He also criticized the violence and bribery that accompanied ANC meetings leading up to the Mangaung conference, which saw several people killed.

"We should not allow the situation where those who have money turn ANC members into commodities," Zuma said. "All these tendencies have been creeping into the movement gradually and they need to be dealt with very strongly."

The 70-year-old Zuma also criticized the process that the government uses to award contracts for allowing corruption that is "turning people we know into something else." That comment, as well as others, drew murmurs from delegates that saw it as a reflection of the corruption allegations and claims of ethical impropriety that have clouded Zuma.

Zuma faces criticism over the millions of dollars of government-paid improvements made to his private homestead. That comes as most black South Africans, the base of the ANC's following, remain mired in poverty.

The president also has been implicated in a corruption probe surrounding a 1999 arms deal, as well as faced accusations from the media about being unable to manage his own personal finances. Zuma also has faced criticisms over his private life, ranging from his multiple marriages to his 2006 trial for charges of raping a family friend that ended in an acquittal.

His main competition in the ANC is Motlanthe, his 63-year-old deputy president and a former union leader. Motlanthe served as a caretaker president for South Africa from September 2008 to May 2009, after Zuma ousted Mbeki as leader of the ANC in tight party election. Motlanthe also offers what appears to be the opposite of Zuma's leadership — a pensive and technocratic approach that differs from Zuma's crowd-pleasing comments and dancing.

Despite the challenge, Zuma still remains the favorite to lead the party. He won more provinces in recent local polls and delegates on Sunday sang pro-Zuma songs and raised their two fingers above their head — a call for his second term. Those supporting Motlanthe rolled their fingers above their head, signifying they wanted a change.

In the coming days, delegates will vote for leaders by a secret ballot, without their mobile phones after concerns arose over people being told to photograph their ballots to prove who they vote for, ANC organizers have said. If it becomes a race with multiple candidates and no one gets more than 50 percent of the ballots cast, there will be a run-off with the top two candidates, they said.

In his speech, Zuma criticized the media and "alien" practices he said were trying to tear the ANC apart. While acknowledging the movement had become an established political party instead of the guerrilla movement of the apartheid era, he also talked about the group's revolutionary past and sang about Nelson Mandela, the 94-year-old anti-apartheid icon who remains hospitalized after suffering from a lung infection and undergoing gallstone surgery.

In mentioning Mandela, as well as the ANC's past, Zuma appeared to try and link his current leadership with the larger history of the party. He cemented that by opening and closing his remarks by singing in Zulu: "The journey is long, ... Mandela told his followers that we'll meet on freedom day."

Newspaper headlines: Bridge over Channel and Prince William's haircut By BBC News

Staff Published duration 19 January 2018

The Anglo-French summit makes the lead for a number of the papers.

The i newspaper has the headline: "New entente cordiale". However, it says the love-in lasted only until French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a tough message to the UK on Brexit.

For the Daily Telegraph , the most eye-catching suggestion was Boris Johnson's idea that Britain and France should build a bridge over the Channel.

However, the HuffPost website says the foreign secretary's proposal faced instant mockery by many - including the shipping industry.

The UK Chamber of Shipping pointed out that building a huge concrete structure in the middle of the world's busiest shipping lane "might come with some challenges".

Jeremy Corbyn tells the Guardian that Labour will halt what he calls the "outsourcing racket" exposed by the collapse of Carillion.

In an interview, he promises to re-write the rules to "give the public back control of their services."

The paper says Carillion's collapse has emboldened Mr Corbyn to press home his message that Labour rejects the "dogma of privatisation".

Elections in Zimbabwe

An interview with Zimbabwe's new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, is the lead for the Financial Times

It says he's signalled a clean break with the past and a desire to re-engage with the West by inviting the UN, the EU and the Commonwealth to monitor the country's elections this year.

He tells the paper: "We want fair, free, credible elections."

The flu outbreak is reported on a number of front pages.

The Daily Mirror's main story says that if present trends continue, an epidemic could be declared across England within a fortnight.

According to the Daily Telegraph , health officials had been fearful about the impact of the so-called "Australian flu".

Bit it says it is another strain, known as "Japanese flu" that's dominating - and it is not covered by the vaccines most patients have received.

Interpreter anger

The former head of the military, Lord Richards, tells the Daily Mail he is ashamed of the government's decision not to allow the British armed forces' longest-serving Afghan interpreter into the UK.

The paper says the interpreter - known as Ricky - worked for the British military in Afghanistan for 16 years and was described by senior British officers as showing "unfailing loyalty".

A Number 10 spokesman tells the paper that more than 390 former Afghan staff and their families have been relocated to the UK, and over 40 more are expected to follow.

Finally, take your pick of the royals on the front and inside pages.

There are many pictures of Prince Harry and fiance Meghan Markle "wowing the crowds" - as the Telegraph puts it - on their visit to Cardiff.

The Sun says centuries of royal tradition were melted as Miss Markle brought the warmth of modern celebrity to adoring crowds.

The Daily Mail reports that she signed autographs - not something that members of the royal family usually do - and even took part in a group hug.

There's also widespread interest in the Duke of Cambridge's new closely-cropped hairstyle, which was on show during an engagement in London yesterday.

Oxidation of the Benzyl Radical: Mechanism, Thermochemistry, and Kinetics for the Reactions of Benzyl Hydroperoxide.
Oxidation of the benzyl radical plays a key role in the autoignition, combustion, and atmospheric degradation of toluene and other alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons. Under relevant autoignition conditions of moderate temperature and high pressure, and in the atmosphere, benzyl reacts with O2 to form the benzylperoxy radical, and the further oxidation reactions of this radical are not yet fully characterized. In this contribution, we further develop the reaction chemistry, thermodynamics, and kinetics of benzyl radical oxidation, highlighting the important role of benzyl hydroperoxide and the benzoxyl (benzyloxyl) radical. The benzylperoxy + H reaction mechanism is studied using computational chemistry and statistical reaction rate theory. High-pressure limit rate constants in the barrierless benzylperoxy + H association are obtained from variational transition state theory calculations, with internal rotor contributions. The benzylperoxy + H reaction is seen to produce an activated benzyl hydroperoxide adduct that has 87 kcal mol(-1) excess energy over the ground state. We show that this activated adduct proceeds almost exclusively to the benzoxyl radical + OH across a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. Minor reaction paths include benzyl + HO2, α-hydroxylbenzyl + OH, and benzaldehyde + H2O, each constituting around 1% of the total reaction rate at higher temperatures. Thermal decomposition of benzyl hydroperoxide, formed by hydrogen abstraction reactions in the benzylperoxy radical and at low temperatures in the benzylperoxy + H and benzyl + HO2 reactions, is also investigated. Decomposition to benzoxyl + OH is fast at temperatures of 900 K and above. The contribution of benzyl hydroperoxide chemistry to the ignition and oxidation of alkylated aromatics is discussed. Benzyl radical oxidation chemistry achieves the conversion of toluene to benzaldehyde, aiding autoignition via processes that either release large amounts of energy or form reactive free radicals through chain-branching.

Sensing sulfur conditions: simple to complex protein regulatory mechanisms in plant thiol metabolism.
Sulfur is essential for plant growth and development, and the molecular systems for maintaining sulfur and thiol metabolism are tightly controlled. From a biochemical perspective, the regulation of plant thiol metabolism highlights nature's ability to engineer pathways that respond to multiple inputs and cellular demands under a range of conditions. In this review, we focus on the regulatory mechanisms that form the molecular basis of biochemical sulfur sensing in plants by translating the intracellular concentration of sulfur-containing compounds into control of key metabolic steps. These mechanisms range from the simple (substrate availability, thermodynamic properties of reactions, feedback inhibition, and organelle localization) to the elaborate (formation of multienzyme complexes and thiol-based redox switches). Ultimately, the dynamic interplay of these regulatory systems is critical for sensing and maintaining sulfur assimilation and thiol metabolism in plants.

National quality ratings must for all state colleges

All colleges that want to continue operating in the state will now have to improve their academic infrastructure and student resource facilities and queue up to be rated by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) or the National Board of Accreditation (NBA).

All colleges that want to continue operating in the state will now have to improve their academic infrastructure and student resource facilities and queue up to be rated by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) or the National Board of Accreditation (NBA).

In a government order dated October 8, the higher and technical education department made the accreditation mandatory for all institutions in Maharashtra.

Currently, only 25 per cent of these colleges have accreditation.

The government resolution states that experts, including the joint board of vice-chancellors, are of the opinion that the lack of mandatory accreditation has had a negative effect on the quality of higher education.

The University of Mumbai’s NAAC rating expired two years ago; it’s still in the process of applying for fresh accreditation.

“Those institutes that have already got accreditation should get it renewed and those approved after 2001 should send proposals for accreditation latest by November 30,” said Mahesh Phatak, secretary of higher and technical education.

The NAAC and NBA ratings are valid for five years.

They are expected to keep college managements in check, increase competition and give students a fair evaluation of the institutions. While the NAAC accredits traditional arts, science and commerce colleges, the NBA gives quality certificates to professional institutes.

The decision follows directives given by authorities including the high court and the University Grants Commission. The 13 universities in the state through quarterly reviews will have to monitor that the colleges affiliated to them submit accreditation proposals. Institutes that fail to apply can lose their university affiliation.

Ottawa’s winter festival, Winterlude, kicks off today with a party on Sparks Street.. (You can find the full list of official events here:). While the party is sure to be fun, and organizers have applied some cool colour and light treatments to the shopfronts that line the pedestrian mall, you may find yourself wanting to escape from the cold and warm up indoors.. Our favourite options on or near Sparks? Riviera is delish. BierMarkt has some good food options, and a huge beer menu. For coffee or hot chocolate, you can try a local (for now) chain called Bridgehead or head south one block on Metcalfe to Moulin de Provence.. The weather forecast is looking pretty good for Winterlude’s first weekend. Bundle up and enjoy.

Q:

What does it mean to represent elements of an ideal?

Say I have the polynomial $x^9 + 1$
Then: $x^9 + 1 = (x+1)(x^2 + x + 1)(x^6 + x^3 + 1)$
is a complete factorization over $GF(2)$ of  $x^9 + 1$
The dimension of each ideal is: length $n - deg(ideal)$
So for $n=9$, dimension of $(x+1)$ = $9-1=8$
of $(x^2 + x + 1) = 9 - 2 = 7$
of $(x^6 + x^3 + 1) = 9 - 6 = 3$
So let's use $(x^6 + x^3 + 1)$ as the example. The dimension is 3. So there should be $2^3 = 8$ elements. How do I find those elements?

A:

Let’s call $f=x^6+x^3+1$. You want three linearly independent elements of the ideal $(f)$ of the ring $R=\Bbb F_2[x]/(x^9+1)$. Since $(f)$ is just the set of multiples of $f$, you certainly have $1\cdot f$, $xf$, and $x^2f$. Notice that $x^3f=x^9+x^6+x^3=1+x^6+x^3=1\cdot f$, already counted. I’ll leave it to you to show that those three polynomials are $\Bbb F_2$-linearly independent in $R$.



A new context means a new approach to advance the debate on gambling reform

The Campaign for Fairer Gambling's Matt Zarb-Cousin reflects on the successful campaign to reduce Fixed Odds Betting Terminal (FOBT) stake levels to £2 per spin and sets out how the campaign to reduce gambling related harm will continue going forward.

When philanthropist Derek Webb established the Campaign for Fairer Gambling (CFG), his main concern was with Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs). In 2013 CFG established Stop the FOBTs, a campaign to reduce the maximum stake on these highly addictive machines to £2 a spin. Last month, the Government enacted this precise policy. It’s unusual for a campaign to achieve its exact objective, and the question of what happens to once insurgent single-issue campaigners when they suddenly represent the consensus view is a welcome issue to have to resolve.

I started campaigning against FOBTs in 2012, before I met and teamed up with Derek. At that time, gambling-related harm was widely regarded by policymakers as the consequence of somehow “faulty” individuals. The dominant “responsible gambling” paradigm located the cause of harm in “irresponsible” or “reckless” behaviour, marginalising the impact of marketing, access and addictive or harmful products. There was great resistance by not just the betting sector but the entire gambling establishment - including the regulator and the Responsible Gambling Trust - to the notion that the product, including the maximum stake, can have an impact on levels of harm.

Campaigning successfully against FOBTs therefore required an overhaul of how the role of gambling products was perceived in the context of inducing or exacerbating harm. The evidence showed that not all gambling is the same, some products are more addictive than others, and FOBTs were the most harmful. Winning this argument in the media, with the public and with politicians has led to something of an intellectual revolution in the key bodies of the gambling establishment, including in the Government, at GambleAware (formerly the Responsible Gambling Trust) and within the Gambling Commission. The regulator’s shift away from a player-centric to a more all-encompassing approach to harm prevention is exemplified by their new strategy’s departure from the “responsible gambling” paradigm in favour of advocating “safer gambling”, which is targeted primarily at gambling operators.

This paradigm shift means gambling businesses can no longer deny the real danger of levels of harm, or that the solution may be in limiting stakes on certain products. Remote gambling operators have no choice but to engage constructively with this new consensus on meaningful solutions that will significantly reduce the sector’s unsustainable reliance on people experiencing disordered gambling. Their alternative is obsolescence.

Gambling operators know they need to adapt to this new context, which means we have to adapt as well. When the key institutions of the gambling establishment all agree on there being real dangers and are receptive to meaningful solutions, we are no longer insurgent campaigners but stakeholders who can engage constructively in policymaking.

There are now many different ways we can do this. Labour is putting together a new Gambling Act, and has already committed to introducing limits to gambling products online. The All Party Parliamentary Group on FOBTs has rebranded as the All Party Parliamentary Group on Gambling Related Harm and is looking into online gambling as part of a new inquiry. Powerful groups such as Gambling With Lives are emerging, giving a voice to previously voiceless bereaved families, and advancing the evidence of a link between gambling addiction and suicide.

With the support of Derek Webb, I will carry on working with these entities and with the media to inform the debate, as well as continuing my involvement with the development of blocking software Gamban, which recently won Reg Tech Provider of the Year at the Gambling Compliance awards. If a need for a campaign on a single issue arises, and if the landscape means an insurgent campaign is the most effective means for achieving a specific objective, then we will put one together. But I am optimistic about what can be achieved in the short term without that.

It was alleged during a Channel 4 News debate I took part in that i was deliberately misleading viewers and was funded by the casino industry. The Association of British Bookmakers (ABB) and its CEO Malcolm George have now agreed to pay me costs and undisclosed damages for libel. The full statement in open court can be read here.

They could have apologised straight away but instead it took a hugely expensive and protracted process for them to admit I am not funded by the casino industry. This was an allegation that had been subsequently repeated on social media and risked harming the campaign against FOBTs. The ABB and Malcolm George have also admitted that it was false to say that I was willing to mislead Channel 4 viewers. I am relieved that these false allegations did not impact on our ability to achieve the objective of a cut to £2 a spin.

Those benefitting from remote gambling, and those acting on their behalf, should realise that misleadingly attacking critics or opponents will not help them generate the outcomes that they desire.

Ambre Energy would use this dock at the Port of St. Helens' Port Westward industrial park to transfer coal from Columbia River barges to ocean-going ships.

(Scott Learn, The Oregonian)

The Columbia County Board of Commissioners on Wednesday unanimously approved a plan to rezone 837 acres of farmland to industrial in a key battleground area for environmental groups fighting the region’s coal and oil export projects.

The decision is another step forward for growth at Port Westward, a Columbia River industrial park. It’s also being fought: The formal ordinance making the change hadn’t even been signed before Columbia Riverkeeper and a nearby landowner announced they would protest to the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals, saying the decision violated local farmland protections. The land is used as a tree farm today.

Port Westward, near Clatskanie, is the home of a terminal that’s receiving oil from trains carrying volatile North Dakota crude. Those trains carry the same type of oil that’s been involved in three high-profile explosions since July. The port is also the site of a proposed terminal that would send coal to Asia.

The Port of St. Helens owns the 1,700-acre Port Westward property and wants more space there for industry. Pat Trapp, the port’s executive director, said no projects have been identified for the rezoned land. Any proposal will need another permit, he said, giving the public a chance to weigh in before development occurs.

“This is not a free-for-all,” Trapp said. “It’s just to lay the foundation for the future of the port.”

Columbia Riverkeeper and Mike Seely, a farmer who grows mint on adjacent land, said the rezoning would invite more coal and oil trains through the region and threaten Seely’s mint farm expansion plans.

“The county’s decision will support more dangerous crude oil trains rolling through the Columbia River Gorge, neighborhoods in North Portland, and communities along Highway 30,” said Brett VandenHeuvel, Riverkeeper’s executive director. “It’s a stunning decision that deserves a broader public discussion.”

Recently, the Polish National Fiber Research Laboratory provided linen samples. In addition to these Polish fabric samples, we also collected linen fabric samples which were made in Japan and throughout Europe. We have investigated hand properties of various linen fabrics, and identification of the Polish linen fabrics quality from those of other linen fabrics. The fabric hand of Polish linen fabrics is unique, it possesses a hand just between wool‐like and cotton‐like fabrics. We have clarified that the Polish linen fabrics are suitable for hari ‐type and tailored type silhouette designs for women’s wear, and the fabrics are well‐suited for finishing garment appearance..

1. Field of the Invention
This invention relates generally to circuits for accomplishing convergence of electron beams on display panels of color cathode ray tubes, and more particularly, is directed to a circuit used with a color cathode ray tube for correcting dynamic misconvergence of electron beams therein so as to cause the color cathode ray tube to display fine images of high quality.
2. Description of the Prior Art
For the purpose of correction of dynamic misconvergence of electron beams in the horizontal direction caused on the display panel of a color cathode ray tube of the in-line type, such circuits as shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B in the drawings have been proposed. The circuit shown in FIG. 1A is used for correcting the dynamic misconvergence in the horizontal direction appearing at every horizontal period. In this circuit, a voltage of parabolic waveform having the horizontal period and a voltage of saw-tooth waveform having the horizontal period are mixed in a mixer 1H, and a mixed voltage obtained from the mixer 1H is supplied through an amplifier 2H to a coil 3H provided for correcting the dynamic misconvergence in the horizontal direction appearing every horizontal period on the display panel of the color cathord ray tube. With such an arrangement, the condition of electron beam convergence in the color cathode ray tube can be adjusted between the situation where an electron beam for stimulating a phosphor provided on the display panel for emitting red light (hereinafter referred to as a red beam) is shifted to the left on the display panel as shown in the left side of FIG. 2A and the situation where the red beam is shifted to the right on the display panel as shown in the right side of FIG. 2A by means of varying the amplitude of the voltage of parabolic waveform having the horizontal period. The condition of electron beam convergence can be adjusted also between the situation where the red beam is shifted to the inside on the display panel as shown in the left side of FIG. 2B and the situation where the red beam is shifted to the outside on the display panel as shown in the right side of FIG. 2B by means of varying both the amplitude and polarity of the voltage of saw-tooth waveform having the horizontal period.
On the other hand, the circuit shown in FIG. 1B is used for correcting the dynamic misconvergence in the horizontal direction appearing at every vertical period. In this circuit, a voltage of parabolic waveform having the vertical period and a voltage of saw-tooth waveform having the vertical period are mixed in a mixer 1V, and a mixed voltage obtained from the mixer 1V is supplied through an amplified 2V to a coil 3V provided for correcting the dynamic misconvergence in the horizontal direction appearing every vertical period on the display panel of the color cathord ray tube. With such an arrangement, the condition of electron beam convergence in the color cathode ray tube can be adjusted between such a situation as shown in the left side of FIG. 2C and such a situation as shown in the right side of FIG. 2C by means of varying the amplitude of the voltage of parabolic waveform having the vertical period. The condition of electron beam convergence can be adjusted also between such a situation as shown in the left side of FIG. 2D and such a situation as shown in the right side of FIG. 2D by means of varying both the amplitude and polarity of the voltage of sawtooth waveform having the vertical period.
Incidentally, through FIGS. 2A to 2D showing various situations of the dynamic misconvergence in the horizontal direction as mentioned above, R, G and B indicate the positions on the display panel of the red beam, an electron beam for stimulating a phosphor provided on the display panel for emitting green light (a green beam) and an electron beam for stimulating a phosphor provided on the display panel for emitting blue light (a blue beem), respectively.
With the previously proposed circuits as mentioned above, since the positions of the electron beams on the display panel are shifted at both the left and right sides of the display panel by either one of the variation of the amplitude of the voltage of parabolic waveform having the horizontal period and the variations of the amplitude and polarity of the voltage of saw-tooth waveform having the horizontal period on the occasion of adjustment for correcting the dynamic misconvergence in the horizontal direction appearing every horizontal period, as understood from FIGS. 2A and 2B, it is necessary for correcting the dynamic misconvergence in the horizontal direction appearing every horizontal period at both the left and right sides on the display panel to establish a tracking relation between the adjustment by means of varying the amplitude of the voltage of parabolic waveform having the horizontal period and the adjustment by means of varying the amplitude and polarity of the voltage of saw-tooth waveform having the horizontal period. Further, since the positions of the electron beams on the display panel are shifted also at both the top and bottom sides of the display panel by either one of the variation of the amplitude of the voltage of parabolic waveform having the vertical period and the variations of the amplitude and polarity of the voltage of saw-tooth waveform having the vertical period on the occasion of adjustment for correcting the dynamic misconvergence in the horizontal direction appearing every vertical period, as understood from FIGS. 2C and 2D, it is necessary for correcting the dynamic misconvergence in the horizontal direction appearing every vertical period at both the top and bottom sides on the display panel to establish a tracking relation between the adjustment by means of varying the amplitude of the voltage of parabolic waveform having the vertical period and the adjustment by means of varying the amplitude and polarity of the voltage of saw-tooth waveform having the vertical period. As a result, the adjustments for correcting the dynamic misconvergence in the horizontal direction require very complicated and troublesome control, and moreover the misconvergence at each of four corners of the display panel where the electron beams are affected with all the adjustments is substantially unable to be eliminated.

The Shankaracharya replied:. Sanatan Dharma is not bound by space and time, or division of the human race at all. It is for the human race as a whole. All religions are supported on the basic idea of Sanatan Dharma.. The Shankaracharya added:. These ten factors are for all human beings. The meaning of Sanatan is that the root of this concept has no end or beginning it was not started by any particular man, and it will never end whatever happens. As long as human beings exist these concepts will prevail.. There is a Sanskrit shloka which says that if one learns to understand that one is part of this universe, and one has equal status with everyone else, then give to others what you would like given to you - what pleases you should be made available for the pleasure of others - or 'do as you would be done by'. This sums up the concept of Sanatan Dharma - it is not a religion, it is a concept for humanity.

Like many of us, I had acne as a teenager. I tried everything from charcoal face washes to toothpaste and never quite got a grip on it. Luckily, it pretty much disappeared when I went on the pill at around 17 – with occasional breakouts during the inactive pill days.. That was over a decade ago now, and my skin has been largely under control since then. But earlier this year, I had the misfortune of experiencing multiple pulmonary embolisms – or blood clots in the lung. After plenty of time in hospital, it was discovered that I had a rare clotting disorder, which meant that taking the pill was out of the question due to the increased risk for more clots. What I wasn’t prepared for, at the ripe old age of 30, was how my teenage skin would come back with a vengeance a couple of weeks after stopping. A bit of research indicated that my body was basically adjusting to life without the pill and ramping up hormone production – leading to breakouts of acne, blackheads, and generally unhappy skin.

Court denies appeal for Arizona death-row inmate. PHOENIX -- An Arizona death-row inmate has lost an appeal that argued that he didn't have effective legal representation during his sentencing in a Maricopa County murder case in which a man was set on fire.. The 9th U.S. Circuit of Appeals ruled that the lawyer representing Eldon Schurz did present the trial court with evidence that might support sentencing leniency, so Schurz cannot show his rights were violated.. Schurz was sentenced to death for setting another man on fire with gasoline after the other man objected to Schurz stealing beer from a group of people.. The sentencing judge ruled that the 1989 killing of Jonathan Bahe "was especially heinous and depraved.". Most Popular. World Class Arizona. Voice For A Better Arizona.

Local Food Bank benefits from VQA Wine Sales at LCBO

Ontario wineries give back to communities
WATERLOO, ON, March 11 /CNW/ - The Ontario wine industry has donated more
than $50,000 to local food banks including Waterloo through a "Buy Local"
program launched during the holiday season that was aimed at helping to reduce
hunger.
For every bottle of VQA wine purchased at an LCBO from November to
December, 25 cents was donated to the Ontario Association of Food Banks
(OAFB). All funds raised were shared with member food banks proportionately
across the province. Ten thousand dollars will be shared with all food banks
in Southwestern Ontario, including the Food Bank of Waterloo Region.
"We were pleased to see so many customers embracing the 'buy local'
philosophy including supporting our quality VQA wines and we really felt it
was important to share in our success by giving back to our own communities,"
said Hillary Dawson, President of the Wine Council of Ontario.
The objective of the "Buy Local, Share Local" was to raise enough funds
to help the network of food banks across the province acquire and distribute
$400,000 worth of food for those in need. Because of the high efficiency of
food banks, the contributions of committed volunteers, and excellent
relationships with food industry donors, a one dollar donation can help food
banks acquire and distribute eight dollars worth of food. As a result, a
target of $50,000 was set which was achieved.
"We were delighted to have the support of Ontario's wine industry through
Buy Local, Share Local," said Wendy Campbell, Executive Director of The Food
Bank of Waterloo Region. "It will have a direct impact on our ability to meet
the needs of those we serve in the Waterloo region as well as at other food
banks in Southwestern Ontario."
"We live in a very prosperous province, and yet hundreds of thousands of
Ontarians are forced to turn to food banks because they face hunger every
day," said Adam Spence, Executive Director of the OAFB. "We are proud to work
with the Wine Council of Ontario in order to support local food banks and to
encourage Ontarians to support our local producers and neighbours this holiday
season."
"The LCBO is pleased to be a part of this important initiative," said Bob
Peter, LCBO President and CEO. "Our customers are generous supporters of
worthy causes and we're pleased to help facilitate this worthwhile fundraising
project launched by Ontario wineries this holiday season."
The campaign was also extended to participating winery properties
throughout Ontario's wine regions where $3,000 raised from the tasting bars
was donated back to local food banks in the region. For more information about
the program, log on to www.winesofontario.ca
About the Wine Council of Ontario
The Wine Council of Ontario is a non-profit trade association that
represents Ontario's four wine regions - Niagara Peninsula, Pelee Island, Lake
Erie North Shore and Prince Edward Country. These regions grow 75 per cent of
the grapes used in Canadian wine production
About The Ontario Association of Food Banks (OAFB)
The OAFB is a network of over 100 food banks working to end hunger across
the province from Ottawa to Windsor, and Niagara Falls to Thunder Bay. 320,000
Ontarians are served by food banks every month, and 40 per cent of those
served are children. The OAFB moves millions of pounds of food every year,
coordinates the food bank distribution network, encourages safety and quality,
provides support on development, operations, and management, and raises the
profile of hunger in Ontario.

It contains a LOT of stories “based” on information from the Quran and Sunnah, and each story is explained nicely for the kids. My only note would be that some of the stories use a little of the writers imagination rather than just the actual Information in ahadiths and ayahs, so keep an eye out for anything that might make you uncomfortable.

Distribution of sympathetic preganglionic neurons and monoaminergic nerve terminals in the spinal cord of the rat.
A study was made of the distribution of sympathetic preganglionic neurons identified by retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase from various peripheral nerve trunks and of the distributions of monoaminergic terminals in the spinal cord of the rat. Nerve terminals were stained immunohistochemically by using antisera raised against tyrosine hydroxylase, phenylethanolamine-N-methyl-transferase, neuropeptide Y, and 5-hydroxytryptamine and by using formaldehyde-induced fluorescence. The three-dimensional distribution of sympathetic preganglionic neurons was described by using computer reconstruction and compared with the arrangement of each population of immunohistochemically stained terminals in the intermediate zone. Although monoaminergic terminals are associated with most sympathetic neurons, particularly in the intermediolateral column, the relationship of many terminals to sympathetic neuron somata in other parts of the intermediate zone is tenuous. Some of the descending innervation may terminate on interneurons. The data are consistent with the coexistence of phenylethanolamine-N-methyl-transferase and neuropeptide Y in terminals arising from cell bodies in the C1 region in the ventrolateral medulla and with the presence of at least two populations of catecholaminergic terminals as well as the adrenergic one. Serotoninergic terminals are denser and have a different arrangement from those of catecholaminergic terminals in the intermediate zone.

Dear Editors,

Thank you for the comments regarding the manuscripts listed below:

Segev G, Palm C, LeRoy B, et al. Evaluation of neutrophil gelatinase‐associated lipocalin as a marker of kidney injury in dogs. J Vet Intern Med 2013; 27:1362--1367.Palm CA, Segev G, Cowgill LD, et al.

Regarding Fig [1](#jvim14564-fig-0001){ref-type="fig"} in the 2013 publication, we agree with the comment. The box plot does extend beyond the 238,000 limit. The order of sensitivity and specificity was flipped in the original sentence. The sentence should read: "The optimal UNCR cutoff point was 238,000 pg/mg, corresponding to a specificity and sensitivity of 100% and 85%, respectively."

Regarding the 2016 paper, the "baseline" referred to the healthy controls and this was what was intended to be represented in the original text. For clarification, we therefore suggest that the sentence be modified as follows: "In another study, we reported that a \>7‐fold increase in uNGAL‐to‐urinary‐creatinine ratio (UNCR) above the upper limit of the healthy control group discriminated AKI from other types of urinary disease."

Regarding the figure, there was an error in the original figure and the same dog was depicted three times. Attached is the modified and corrected figure.

Thiazide diuretic monotherapy for hypertension: diuretic's dark side just got darker.
Diuretic monotherapy is the current recommendation of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure for initial antihypertensive therapy. There is mounting concern, however, that the benefits of diuretic's superior blood pressure control may be offset by its multiple metabolic disturbances that increase cardiovascular risk. Reungjui et al. document a new concern, nephrotoxicity by thiazide monotherapy. This and other recently published evidence of diuretic's 'dark side' is discussed.

Q:

How to properly apply indexex to my mysql DB

Currently I am having an issue with slow queries to my DB - query time varies from 0.0005 seconds to 70 seconds.
Currently my table structure with content is following:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `content` (
  `content_id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `content_url` text NOT NULL,
  `content_text` text NOT NULL,
  `seed_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `created_at` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `image` varchar(2000) DEFAULT NULL,
  `price` varchar(300) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`content_id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `CONTENT_TEXT_UNIQUE` (`content_text`(255)),
  KEY `FK_SEED_CODE` (`seed_id`),
  KEY `CONTENT_TEXT_TIME_INDEX` (`content_text`(255),`created_at`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=111357870 ;

ALTER TABLE `content`
  ADD CONSTRAINT `FK_SEED_ID` FOREIGN KEY (`seed_id`) REFERENCES `seed` (`seed_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;

Currently I have only 2 queries to Database:

SELECT seed.seed_code,content.content_id as id, content.content_url, content.content_text, content.created_at, content.image, content.price FROM content
        LEFT JOIN seed ON content.seed_id = seed.seed_id 
        WHERE seed.seed_switch = 1 AND seed.seed_status_id = 3 AND seed.seed_id in (
        SELECT seed_id FROM seed WHERE storage_id ='.$storage.') '.$filter.' ORDER BY content.content_id DESC, content.created_at DESC LIMIT 50

And

SELECT seed.seed_code,content.content_id as id, content.content_url, content.content_text, content.created_at, content.image, content.price FROM content
        LEFT JOIN seed ON content.seed_id = seed.seed_id 
        WHERE seed.seed_switch = 1 AND seed.seed_status_id = 3 AND seed.seed_id in (
        SELECT seed_id FROM seed WHERE storage_id ='.$storage.') ORDER BY content.content_id DESC, content.created_at DESC LIMIT 50

Table seed contains ± 20 entries. Which doesn't change mostly.
Indexes created on content table seems not working, because still I am having very big load time. 
What could be the improvements of DB?
UPDATE 1
The content tables contains around 1mil entries and it grows every day with 1-2k entries.
$filter variable contains additional filters. So some other AND statements, which are generated randomly depending of user input. But it filters only content.text and created_at date.

A:

EDIT
Ok, noticed the autoincrement in your create table.  You have or have had millions of records (since increment is over 100 million) and are running a where-in subselect, not going to get ideal performance taking that approach. Try below query and see if that improves load times.
You haven't supplied all the details (for example, how many records the tables in question have and what the output of '.$filter.' is), but more than likely the subselect is the cause of the slow load time. Also, save yourself some typing and alias the tables! Cleaned up example:
SELECT s.seed_code, c.content_id as id, c.content_url, c.content_text, c.created_at, c.image, c.price 
FROM content c
JOIN seed s USING(seed_id)
WHERE s.seed_switch = 1 
  AND s.seed_status_id = 3 
  AND s.storage_id ='.$storage.'
  '.$filter.' 
ORDER BY c.content_id DESC
LIMIT 50



Farmers market regular boasts perfect attendance. The annual North Platte Farmers Market has been a staple of summer for over forty years, and Leva Cochran has been there for every single year.. Cochran's husband is the one who first encouraged her to sell their produce at the farmers market. So, she loaded up a truck of turnips and has continued to make appearances selling tomatoes, peppers, garlic and cinnamon-roasted nuts.. Cochran grows all the produce it in her garden and spends a day picking and sorting before coming to the market. She has also sold cinnamon rolls in the past. Cochran said the tomatoes were the biggest seller of the day.. "I had a lot of customers on green tomatoes today," Cochran said. "Even had some people from the south that were travelling. . . 'Oh! Green tomatoes,' he was really happy about that.". Cochran will make apperances at the market in the coming weeks.

For faithful transmission of genetic information during cell division, all chromosomes need to be encapsulated into a single daughter nucleus, but the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Ohsugi et al. in Tadashi Yamamoto’s Lab demonstrated that Kid/Kinesin-10, a chromosome-associated kinesin-like motor protein known as chromokinesin, contributes to this event. By analyzing mice and cultured cells lacking expression of chromokinesin Kid, they show that Kid deficiency causes defects in compact clustering of the anaphase chromosomes. This often leads to micro- or multinuclear formation at oocyte meiosis II and the first couple of mitoses after fertilization, causing embryonic death in mice. Later somatic mitoses are not fatally affected by the absence of Kid, suggesting that cell divisions under significant influence of the ooplasm specifically require Kid to prevent formation of multinucleated cells..

It’s late in the day on Mother Mary’s birthday, and I’m still wondering what to give her as a present. Last night I had all kinds of great plans in mind. This morning I had all kinds of great intentions to realize those plans. Then all kinds of great chaotic things happened which dramatically altered those great plans and the realization thereof.. One of the things I’d wanted to do was to offer her a spiritual bouquet of sacrifices. Oh, I had some pretty grandiose ideas in that regard. But then this thing called life got in the way. Good grief, Charlie Brown. What a blockhead.. But maybe Charlie’s got something there. The one thing I really admire about Charlie Brown is that he never tries to be anything but himself. He is what he is, blockhead and all.. Well, this blockhead is what she is. What I have to offer the Blessed Mother on her special day is the sacrifice of not having been able to make any sacrifices.. Happy Birthday, Mother Mary!

1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to memory systems for computers. More particularly, the present invention relates to the design of a memory interface that maintains a table indicating which banks of memory are currently in use so that during a memory access the system can rapidly determine if a bank conflict exists.
2. Related Art
As processor speed continually increase, memory systems are under increasing pressure to provide data at faster rates. This has recently led to the development of new memory system designs. Memory latencies have been dramatically decreased by using page mode and extended data out (EDO) memory designs, which achieve a high burst rate and low latencies within a single page of memory. Another recent innovation is to incorporate a synchronous clocked interface into a memory chip, thereby allowing data from within the same page of memory to be clocked out of the memory in a continuous stream. Such memory chips, with clocked interfaces are known as synchronous random access memories.
As memory latencies decrease, address decoding time is becoming a significant factor in limiting memory system performance. In many computer systems, memory is comprised of a plurality of banks, each one of which is able to service memory requests independently of other banks. Hence, it is possible to issue a memory request to a bank that is not busy while other banks are busy processing preceding memory requests. This bank-level parallelism can greatly improve system performance.
However, in memory systems with multiple banks extra memory decoding time is often required to determine if a bank conflicts exists. A bank conflict occurs when a memory access operation attempts to access a bank that is busy servicing a preceding memory request. Systems typically test for bank conflicts by comparing an address for a current request against all outstanding requests to determine if the current request is directed to a bank that is busy processing an outstanding memory request. If so, the system does not issue the current request to the bank until the bank becomes free.
Unfortunately, the additional decoding time required to check for bank conflicts can offset the performance gained by accessing memory banks in parallel. What is needed is a method and an apparatus that reduces the decoding time required to determine if a bank conflict exists.
One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that rapidly determines whether a bank conflict exists during a memory access operation. The system includes an input that receives an address as part of the memory access operation. The system also includes a bank conflict table including an entry for each bank of memory in the computer system. Each entry indicates whether a corresponding bank of memory is presently busy servicing a memory request. The bank conflict table includes a lookup mechanism that is configured to use the address to identify a target bank of memory to which the memory access operation is directed, and to look up an entry for the target bank of memory in the bank conflict table. The system also includes a request issuing mechanism that is configured to immediately issue the memory access operation to the target bank of memory if the entry indicates that the target bank is not busy. Otherwise, the request issuing mechanism stalls the memory access operation until the target bank becomes available.
In one embodiment of the present invention, upon issuing the memory access operation to the target bank of memory, the memory request issuing mechanism is further configured to set the entry corresponding to the target bank of memory in the bank conflict table so that subsequent memory access operations will detect that the target bank of memory is busy. In a variation on this embodiment, the memory request issuing mechanism is further configured to: issue a RAS signal to the target bank of memory; issue a CAS signal to the target bank of memory; and issue a precharge signal to the target bank of memory. (Note that this precharge operation can also be accomplished by using a CAS signal with an autoclose command.) After issuing the RAS signal and the CAS signal, the memory request issuing mechanism is further configured to reset the entry for the target bank of memory in the bank conflict table so that subsequent memory access operations will detect that the target bank of memory is not busy;
In one embodiment of the present invention, the lookup mechanism includes circuitry that uses the address to identify the target bank of memory while the address is in transit through a core logic unit, and before the address arrives at a memory controller.
In one embodiment of the present invention, the bank conflict table is located in the memory controller.

Bacterial counts associated with recycled newspaper bedding.
Bacterial counts associated with recycled newspaper, wood shavings, and pelleted corn cobs used as bedding for lactating dairy cows were compared. Chopped newspaper and pelleted corn cobs had similar gram-negative bacterial, coliform, and streptococcal bedding counts. Staphylococcal counts in pelleted corn cobs were greater than in chopped newspaper. Conversely, gram-negative bacterial, coliform, and staphylococcal counts in chopped newspaper were greater than in wood shavings. Coliform and streptococcal counts did not differ between chopped newspaper and wood shavings bedding materials. Teat swab counts from cows bedded on pelleted corn cobs were greater than those from cows bedded on chopped newspaper for gram-negative bacterial, coliform, Klebsiella species, and staphylococci. Streptococcal teat swab counts did not differ between cows bedded on chopped newspaper and pelleted corn cobs. Cows bedded on chopped newspaper and wood shavings had similar gram-negative bacterial, coliform, and Klebsiella species teat swab counts. Streptococcal and staphylococcal teat swab counts were greater from cows bedded on chopped newspaper than those from cows bedded on wood shavings. Teat swab and bedding counts were correlated. In general, bacterial counts in bedding suggest no advantage in using chopped newspaper over pelleted corn cobs or wood shavings in reducing exposure of teats to environmental mastitis pathogens.

Recent tick surveys sent to the US Department of Agriculture identified a longhorned tick on an opossum in Polk County, North Carolina. The longhorned tick is an exotic species from Asia that is a serious pest of livestock.. The tick was initially identified in New Jersey in 2017, but further research into other reported ticks that may have been misidentified have revealed that the first recorded case of this tick was on a white-tailed deer in August 2010 in West Virginia. Before its introduction in North Carolina, the tick had been positively identified in Arkansas, New Jersey, Virginia and West Virginia. .

The Prophet. Fantasy Romance. I am very excited to share the cover of my first romance novel with all of you, and here it is!.. For my last look at heroine analysis (for the moment, anyway), I took a look at the novel I am currently revising.. I finished a first draft and my first revision that made me rewrite the whole ending. The heroine is a slave in a fantasy world trying to escape and find freedom.. So, can I not hate her if she were another author’s heroine?. So, I might need to work with her to make sure she doesn’t come across as passive without making her overstep too many bounds as a slave. At least, I should take another look at it and try to be objective on whether I’d be annoyed with her or not.. Now, does she exhibit the traits I’m looking for to like her?. I think the heroine here has potential, and I’ll need to really focus on making her active, not letting the hero do too much rescuing, and showing her strength and determination. Thoughts to keep in mind as I begin the next round of revisions.

I Love Custom Orders!. It's so much fun to make something inspired by a customer. There's always something new to work with- whether it's a fabric I have never used, or a color scheme I had not thought of- I love how I can make something for a specific someone! Above are some pictures of some of my latest custom orders- loose fitting, silk dupioni "origami" jackets. Such a great item. Named by my customer, the origami inspiration is made by my signature design elements- 3D thread ridges. They can be worn in so many different ways, fit so many sizes and shapes becomingly and silk dupioni is a sculptural and GREAT fabric!. Thanks for looking!

Miley Cyrus is once again preparing herself for a tour that may end up extending beyond the original half-dozen tour dates she recently announced. The news came in the immediate aftermath of her hosting the 2015 premiere of Saturday Night Live, where she showed off her incredibly versatile acting repertoire while also serving as the musical guest.. A classic, rectangular-shaped layout with balconies on the right side and in the very back, the Electric Factory sells out tickets and fills up quick on the night of an event. The fact that a performer who could easily sell out a 50,000-seat venue is performing at a 3,000-capacity place with no seats to speak of is a testament to just how connected she is to her fans. MarketPlaceTickets.com is happy to provide Miley Cyrus fans in Philadelphia with an abundance of affordable ticket options.:

SAN beach known as Children's Pool will be closed between sunset and sunrise until May 15.. That takes the closure through the end of seal pupping season during which seals giver birth to and nurse their young, explains CBS San Diego affiliate KFMB-TV.. The 24-hour "seal-cam" was introduced in January and equipped with night vision so researchers and the public could watch the seals give birth.. But the camera captured people abusing and harassing the seals and driving them from their resting places.. Wildlife advocate Andrea Hahn tells KFMB harassment of the seals during pupping season has been a problem for years. "We've had reports of poaching. We've had shootings here at night. We've had seal mutilations at night.". The beach has been the center of a long legal fight over human access versus seal protection.

"wild starlight". It is no wonder that in a book of poems entitled Light-crossing Michael Redhill makes us attentive to starlight.. starblown night, scattered salt thrown for good luck over a shoulderThat was from "Night Driving". This is from "Mahoney Point". But the Milky Way is a chalk markAnd the title to this blog entry is derived from the final words of "Allen's Hill": wild starlight.. erased against blackness. What is remarkable for me in these examples is the pairing of a celestial figure with a human gesture. In some ways, one would expect such treatment to result in a domestication of the phenomenon. However, the impulsiveness of the gesture releases a sort of sublimity.. And so for day 1874. 30.01.2012

The goals of this project are to understand HIV-1 double infection and its impact on recombination and viral evolution. Cells infected by two or more genetically different viruses can produce heterozygotic virions, from which recombinant viruses are generated. Therefore, double infection directly affects the overall recombination rate. We have studied the nature of HIV-1 double infection in cultured and primary T cells by direct cell-free virus infection and by cell-mediated virus transmission. We have observed that HIV-1 double infection occurs significantly more frequently than it would at random in both transmission pathways. This is the first study that reveals the nature of retroviral double infection. We have also dissected the mechanisms that cause nonrandom HIV-1 double infection, and demonstrated that preference in entry to the host cell played an important role in nonrandom double infection. We are currently establishing other experimental systems to continue our study of retroviral double infection, including examining clinical samples.

Modern Gray area Rugs Inspirational Lumini Grey area Rug Striped Design. Lumini Grey Area Rug Striped Design from Modern Gray area Rugs , source:briers.ca. Modern Gray area Rugs - As our lives become ever more frenetic, the haven that comfortable bedroom designs offer becomes increasingly more welcoming - and not only for sleeping. Noiseless reading, television taking a look at (for the programs you want to watch), enjoying a peaceful light supper, letter writing - they are all activities which may be best suited to that special private space.. Whether accompanied by a partner or not, we have to consider our bedroom the main one area where we are obliged to please no person but ourselves (what indulgence and pampering spring to mind). It therefore makes good sense for the 'best' bedroom space and access to dressing and bathroom facilities to be reserved for this function.. Finally the benefits of self-containment have been became aware. We expect to pay reduced for a hotel collection, so why not plan long term,

Suede shoes Vs. the elements

Just looking for some input with some people that have worn suede shoes in bad weather, do they suffer a short life span and need throwing out after a down pour with lots of puddles? Can't quite find some leather ones I love yet.

You could try suede protector, which does provide a certain amount of protection, but I wouldn't advise wearing suede in heavy rain, particularly shoes that are probably going to be thinner material than, say, a suede jacket. Unfortunately suede is one of those things that looks great but isn't entirely suitable in the UK in my opinion. Go for leather, it's much more rugged and versatile.

If you want your suede shoes to look box fresh, then only wear them when the sun is out. But quality suede can take a bit of rain.​ Just try to avoid getting them completely soaked.

I don't hesitate to wear my Clark's desert boots when it rains. Preferably not too heavy rain, but I'm not afraid to get them a little wet. There will be a slight discolouration, but with proper cleaning and a do over with a brush to give the surface back that suede look and feel, it's hardly noticeable. And especially with brown suede, I don't think it matters. Of course, after every maintenance you have to once again drown them in rain protection.

A guy I know wears suede all year around - not all the time, but he always has a pair of suede shoes in rotation, no matter the season. According to him it's all down to cleaning them regularly (in winter, with snow and mud, this could be close to daily) and that you just drown them in a solid impregnation agent. He only wears darker coloured suede in winter though, like dark brown or navy.

So, while a bit impractical, it is doable.

You have to remember though, the more cleaning and brushing you do, you shorten the lifespan.

Argh mate, I find it a nightmare! I use suede protector/scotch guard, but they still mark so, so easily. Even my dark ones. A good brush with a suede brush normally does the trick, but it's a hassle, and as Marc says, it shortens the lifespan.

I try to avoid wearing them if there is even the tiniest bit of rain. So for most of the year! Shame, as I love my desert boots. Will be getting a couple of pairs of leather ones though.

This invention relates to a package for implements including the provision for the sterilization thereof, and more particularly to a package for a medical or surgical implement which may be sterilized at a time and location remote from the packaging thereof.
The need for sterilized implements in remote locations has in recent years focussed attention on the manner of packaging these implements. For instance, the requirement that a surgical implement be sterile at the time of use in a remote location after considerable time has elapsed since packaging without the necessity of providing expensive and immobile sterilization equipment, is felt in military field use, industrial applications, etc. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,494,726, to Barasch, and assigned to the same assignee as the instant invention, there is disclosed a package and method for remote sterilization which is achieved by placing a surgical instrument in an enclosed package impervious to bacterial contaminants and containing therein a sterilizing gas releasably bonded to a substrate. By the application of heat, the sterilizing gas is released and sterilization of the surgical instrument effected at the remote location.
Although, in the aforementioned U.S. patent, sterilization of a surgical instrument by release of a sterilizing gas is provided, certain problems are encountered. One problem occurs during the period the surgical instrument is stored in the package. During this period, water vapor from the substrate can result in a deleterious effect, e.g. forming rust on the implement. Another problem is possible deleterious effects produced by the formation of a film of the sterilant on the instrument.

Molecular ReI Cages: Structural and Luminescent Properties.
Versatile building block [{Re(CO)4 }3 (C3 N3 S3 )] (1 a; C3 N3 S3 =cyanurate trianion) reacts with linear dipyridyl ligands [i.e., pyrazine (pz), 4,4'-bipyridine (bpy), 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene (bpe), bis(4-pyridyl)acetylene (bpa), and 1,4-bis(pyridyl-4-ylethynyl)benzene (bpb)] and a tripyridyl ligand [1,3,5-tris(4-pyridylethynyl)benzene (tpb)] to afford a series of molecular cages [{Re(CO)3 }6 (L)3 (C3 N3 S3 )2 ] [L=pz (2), bpy (3), bpe (4), bpa (5), bpb (6)] and [{Re(CO)3 }9 (tpb)3 (C3 N3 S3 )3 ] (7) under solvothermal conditions. Various structural dimensions and motifs can be systematically tuned and obtained by using different dipyridyl and tripyridyl ligands in the reactions. The molecular cages of hexanuclear complexes 2-6 containing dipyridyl ligands feature interesting trigonal-prismatic structures with different dimensions. Furthermore, nonanuclear complex 7 has a novel triangular-star structure, and three benzene rings of tpb ligands form a triple-decker arrangement with significant π⋅⋅⋅π interactions having distances of 3.490(1) and 3.528(1) Å. In addition, molecular cages 1-3 and 5-7 exhibit luminescence in the solid state, and their luminescent properties were also studied.

Ease of Learning - User Friendliness. Much has been made recently of increasing sophistication in technology with one of the major benefits advertised as an increase in something called user-friendliness. This term and its meaning needs to be explored further as only by understanding what makes a user friendly system can we work to create one. User friendliness comprises four main elements:. Ease of learning - this can be thought of as minimum start-up time. A system is more user friendly if it can be learned quickly to the point where the level of proficiency is achieved that allows effective achievement of the tasks that need to be carried out.. This includes communication with the user in a language the user can understand, common systems of organisation used in each function and the availability of only those features that are required to complete the work so that the user is not obstructed by peripheral functions that get in the way.

We’re pleased to announce that we’ve released version 1.0 of our New York City Capital Commitments Database. You can view it here.. We constructed this system by taking the scrape made available on Github of the public city data here, then importing it into AirTable to create a database backend.. We tried to build a front-end on top of the AirTable, but discovered that this approach resulted in load times that took way too long because the dataset was so large. So, we built our own backend using the open source Laravel framework to power the app.. Currently, the app only offers display of the data. Our next step is to add interactive features that would allow users to comment on each project that has received capital commitments. You can see the specification for that here.. Our goal is to produce a tool that enables the public to evaluate each capital project and identify projects that seem problematic so watchdog groups can investigate potential waste, fraud and abuse.

Members of The Cyprus Institute win Stelios Bi-communal Business Award

‘Stelios Bi-communal Business Awards’ 2015 ceremony took place for the 7th consecutive year, at Bi - Communal Café of Stelios Philanthropic Foundation in old Nicosia, on Monday 26 October, which was addressed by President Nicos Anastasiades. Congratulations to Marios C. Georgiou (Researcher at Energy, environment and Water Research Center (EEWRC)), Agapios Agapiou (Technical instrument Developer), and Hakan Djuma Researcher at Energy, Environment and Water Research Center (EEWRC), members of The Cyprus Institute, for being awarded by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou as one of 31 winning bi-communal teams, granted a cash prize of €10,000.

The innovative business proposal of the team, is to own a bicycle taxi (driver plus two passengers) and the hybrid system of photovoltaics and manpower pedalling to be integrated. BiCy taxi will be able to cross the green line from the Ledra Street (as it will be registered as a bike and not a car). The BiCy’s “wifi” and GPS to be installed, will provide the possibility to track the bike, and also to provide guiding regarding monuments and sight-seeing within the walls in both, North and South Nicosia.

Not only people who enjoy a green ride in the both sides of Nicosia will pay, but also companies who want to post advertisements on the BiCy taxi will pay for the services. The hybrid-solar-bicycle-taxi will provide innovation, mobility (border-crossing from busy Ledra Street), cooperation and visibility. Benefits will not only be financial and environmental, but also social, as it manifests the team’s vision of green-freedom and advertises it proudly. The BiCy, hybrid-solar- bicycle – taxi, is expected to be the first, bi-communal vehicle participating in the 2016 Solar Challenge to be organized by The Cyprus Institute for the 7th consecutive year.

The ceremony was addressed by the President of the Republic Nicos Anastasiades stressed that “the impressive outreach and success of these bi-communal business awards should come as no surprise: Greek and Turkish Cypriots collaborated and co-created successfully for decades, proving that their common denominator, their Cypriot identity, and their common desire to prosper together, are strong and lingering”.

Speaking at the ceremony, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou said: "This is a charity project, not a political one. This is my way of giving back to the island that my family comes from. This project is one of my ways of repaying my debt to society. We are working over the last 7 years for lasting peace on the island of Cyprus".

The Bi-Communal Café aims to bring closer Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots and manage to strengthen the element of trust and cooperation between them. The award ceremony was attended by many personalities from the political and business world.

Being prepared for acculturation: on the importance of the first months after immigrants enter a new culture.
We hypothesized that perceived communication effectiveness at arrival and initial friendships with members of the receiving society during the first months after arrival in a new country have a long-term effect on the development of acculturation orientations and that this effect is pronounced for individuals with a high need for cognitive closure (NCC). We examined the hypotheses in a study with Spanish-speaking immigrants in Switzerland (n = 146) and in Italy (n = 147). We asked participants to indicate their current attitude to contact with the receiving society and cultural maintenance and report retrospectively their perceived communication effectiveness at arrival and initial friendships. In line with the predictions, the perceptions of high communication effectiveness at arrival and friendships with members of the receiving society during the initial phase in the new culture were positively correlated with the current attitude to contact with the receiving society assessed 7 years after arrival on average. Also, initial friendships with members of the receiving society were negatively correlated with present cultural maintenance. Moreover, with an increase in NCC, these correlations increased.

Protecting Your Camera Gear This Summer/. This week on my blog we are discussing how to take better photos this summer. Today we are discussing how to protect your camera in the elements.. Avoid changing lenses while on the beach - walk off the sand before doing so.. Make sure you have a UV or lens protect filter on your SLR lens to protect the front element from sand and salt spray.. A lens hood offers some additional protection against salt water spray and can eliminate sun glare.. Don't hang your camera around your neck after you've been swimming in the ocean. Salt will still be present on your skin or togs, which can transfer onto your camera.

The approximate minimum area of individual NavMesh regions.. This property allows you to cull away small non-connected NavMesh regions. NavMesh regions whose surface area is smaller than the specified value, will be removed.. Note: some regions may not get removed. The NavMesh is built in parallel as a grid of tiles. If a region straddles a tile boundary, the region is not removed. The reason for this is that the region pruning happens at a stage in the build process where surrounding tiles are not available.

The absence of c-fos prevents light-induced apoptotic cell death of photoreceptors in retinal degeneration in vivo.
Apoptotic cell death in the retina was recently demonstrated in animal models of the hereditary human retinal dystrophy known as retinitis pigmentosa. Although recent evidence indicates that the proto-oncogene c-fos is a mediator of apoptosis, its precise role is unclear. In fact, under some conditions, c-fos may even protect against apoptotic cell death. In the retina, c-fos is physiologically expressed in a diurnal manner and is inducible by light. We previously observed a light-elicited, dose-dependent apoptotic response in rat photoreceptors. To determine whether c-fos is involved in the light-induced apoptotic pathway we have used control mice and mice lacking c-fos. We found that following dark adaptation and two hours of light exposure both groups of animals exhibited only a few apoptotic cells. However, at 12 and 24 additional hours after light exposure, apoptosis increased dramatically in controls but was virtually absent in those mice lacking c-fos. Therefore, c-fos is essential for light-induced apoptosis of photoreceptors. Notably, c-fos is continuously upregulated concomitant with apoptotic photoreceptor death in our system and in animal models of retinitis pigmentosa (Agarwal, N. et al., Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.Sci. Suppl. 36, S638 and Rich, K.A. et al., Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. Suppl. 35, 1833). Inhibition of c-fos expression might therefore represent a novel therapeutic strategy to retard the time course of retinal dystrophies and light-induced retinal degeneration.

The Lambir Hills Forest Dynamics Plot was initiated in 1991 in Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) by the Sarawak Forest Department, CTFS/Harvard University, and Plant Ecology Laboratory of Osaka City University, Japan. Ehime and Kyoto Universities (Japan) are also close collaborators at the site. Lambir's mixed dipterocarp forest is characterized by high endemism, and with approximately 1,200 species found in the 52-ha plot contains possibly the richest diversity of tree species in the Old World. This high species count at the plot is partly due to the plot's location. The plot crosses an abrupt change in soil types that results in a more than 60% change of species composition within 50 meters.

Africa needs $90bn per year to meet energy needs

Africa requires investment of between $60bn and $90bn per year to address its energy needs but innovative new technologies can help make up the shortfall, according to research.

The Economist Intelligence Unit’s report said Africa needs roughly four times the investment recorded in 2014 to meet the goals set by the African Renewable Energy Initiative of 300 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030.

The report, commissioned by engineering group IHS Towers, said meeting this would goal would require a 680% increase in current deployment rates.

Renewable power generation capacity in sub-Saharan Africa is currently just below 30 GW, around 25-30% of total energy production.

However, hydroelectric power accounts for the majority of this figure, with other renewables, such as solar and wind power, accounting for between 4% and 5%.

The report identifies solar and wind energy as most technically feasible and also the renewable sources attracting the majority of investment.

Positive experiences in key markets like South Africa and Kenya should provide a lead in terms of the best strategies to adopt, it said.

However, the report identified how a large pool of African consumers are able to buy power but don’t have access to appropriately priced and designed options.

“In rural regions, off-grid power generation could create an entirely new type of ‘bottom-up’ network as island grids gradually become interconnected. As with mobile in Africa, the key will be smart business models, not just a reliance on cheapening technology,” the report said.

Government-backed procurement programmes are more likely to attract long-term investment than one-off investments, it said.

South Africa, Uganda and Zambia are leading in this approach, the report added.

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed a resolution 14-0 condemning all Israeli settlements on Palestinian land as having “no legal validity” and amounting to “a flagrant violation under international law.” The resolution goes on to note that Israeli settlements pose “a major obstacle to the vision of two States living side-by-side in peace and security.”

This represents the first UNSC resolution in almost eight years concerning Israel and Palestine, and the first in over 35 years regarding the issue of Israeli settlements. Typically the U.S. would veto resolutions critical of Israel, but in this case, the Obama administration opted to abstain, in effect allowing the resolution to pass.

For comment, AlterNet contacted Noam Chomsky, famed linguist, dissident and professor emeritus of MIT. Chomsky said of the resolution, “The UNSC resolution is essentially the same as UNSC 446, March 1979, passed 12-0-3. The main difference is that then two countries joined the U.S. in abstaining. Now the U.S. stands against the world; and under Trump, in even more splendid isolation, on much more crucial matters as well.”

Following the UNSC resolution, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu quickly responded by announcing a halt to his government’s funding contributions to numerous U.N. institutions. Netanyahu called the resolution “a disgraceful anti-Israel maneuver” and blamed it on an “old-world bias against Israel.” Furthermore, he vowed to exact a “diplomatic and economic price” from the countries that supported it.

Shortly thereafter, Netanyahu made good on his threats by personally refusing to meet with the foreign ministers of the 12 UNSC members that voted for the resolution and ordering his Foreign Ministry to limit all working ties with the embassies of those 12 nations. He also summoned the ambassadors to the Foreign Ministry for a personal reprimand over the vote—including, in a highly unusual move, the U.S. ambassador.

Asked about Netanyahu’s response, Chomsky told AlterNet, “The hysterical reaction in Israel and in Congress (bipartisan) reflects their sharp shift to the right in the years since, and the whole incident illustrates quite interesting shifts in world order.”

Palestinian rights advocates have quipped that Israel’s suspension of relations with the UNSC member nations that voted for the resolution—powerful countries including the U.K. and France—has effectively realized a goal of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. AlterNet contacted Omar Barghouti, one of the founders of the BDS movement, to see what he thought of this assessment. Barghouti replied, "This unanimous resolution, despite its many flaws in addressing basic Palestinian rights, has dealt Israel's colonial designs a serious blow that will inadvertently, yet significantly, enhance the impact of the BDS movement in isolating Israel academically, culturally, economically and otherwise."

"Israel's delusional hubris and surreal threats to punish the U.N. and the world indicate above everything else how deeply alarmed it is at fast becoming an international pariah, as apartheid South Africa once was."

Ali Abunimah, the Palestinian-American founder of the Electronic Intifada, told AlterNet that Israel’s use of diplomatic sanctions against the UNSC member states contradicted its vocal opposition to sanctions advocated by the BDS movement. Abunimah said, “It’s sort of amusing to Israel try to impose sanctions and punish the whole world for this decision…Israel claims that sanctions are illegitimate as a tool except of course when Israel is the one wielding them, whether it’s against Iran or whether against the countries that displeased it.”

Though Israel’s heavy-handed response may concretely impact its diplomatic standing internationally, the resolution itself is largely symbolic and, as professor Chomsky pointed out, a reiteration of an earlier UNSC resolution. However, experts like Richard Falk, professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University and former U.N. Special Rapporteur on Palestinian human rights from 2008-2014, don’t think the resolution’s symbolic nature means it isn’t important.

As Falk told AlterNet, “The SC resolution at this stage is symbolic. Israel has already announced plans for thousand additional units, and the government has indicated its refusal to comply with the resolution. Nevertheless, it is of great psychological and potentially political support for the Palestinian struggle to end the occupation and achieve a sustainable and just peace. The fact that aside from the United States' notable abstention, all 14 other members of the Security Council voted in favor of the resolution, is indicative of the encouraging reality that the world is not ready to forget the Palestinians, that Israel faces a renewed experience of diplomatic isolation, and that the growing international solidarity movement, including the BDS campaign, will be strengthened and encouraged.”

Asked how the resolution could move from symbolic to something with more concrete effects, Falk responded, “much depends on the future, and whether the commitment in the resolution to have reports from the U.N. Secretary General every three months on implementation will lead to any tangible results beyond a reiteration of censure remains to be seen.”

Though the Obama administration’s unusual decision not to veto a U.N. resolution critical of Israel might be start toward accountability, many Palestinian rights advocates remain cynical about Obama. Abunimah told AlterNet, “Obama has done more than any other president in history to assure Israel’s impunity.”

“When Obama was president-elect, Israel was engaged in this massacre in Gaza in 2008, 2009. When Obama came in he blocked any form of international accountability, trashed the Goldstone report which was the independent U.N. inquiry. The same in 2014 when Israel attacked Gaza, Obama actually rearmed Israel while the bombs were falling on Gaza and then of course the same story of blocking any form of international accountability. And …giving Israel this unconditional boost in military aid—a minimum of $3.8 billion [per year] over the next 10 years, up from $3.1 billion [per year] currently.”

REGINA - Saskatchewan is extending a survey for mountain pine beetles after a higher than expected number of infested trees were found in a popular recreation area.. Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park straddles the Saskatchewan-Alberta boundary in the south.. A survey of the park by Great Western Forestry found more trees had been affected by the destructive bug than earlier believed.. The government has extended the company's contract so it can verify all infested trees and mark them for removal.. A similar survey in the boreal forest in northwestern Saskatchewan last fall did not find any pine beetles.. There are indications that the pest, which has destroyed large swaths of forest in British Columbia and areas of Alberta, is heading east.. The extra $100,000 to complete the Cypress Hills survey means the Saskatchewan government will have spent $300,000 this fiscal year to monitor the.

Turkey risks a collapse of its secular political system akin to that of the Soviet Union if it bows to international pressure to recognise the 1915-22 Armenian genocide, the head of Armenia's state memorial to the event has told the Guardian.

Hayk Demoyan said Ankara could not acknowledge the systematic killing of up to 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman troops during the first world war because it would lead to a wholesale re-writing of history and undermine the ideological basis of the Turkish state.

In remarks that will cast a shadow over attempts to forge a new Turkish-Armenian rapprochement, he said those implicated included Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of modern Turkey and a figure Turks are taught to revere. Historical documents proved Atatürk committed "war crimes" against Armenians and other groups in his drive to create an ethnically homogeneous Turkish state, Demoyan insisted. "Fear of rewriting history is the main fear of modern Turkey," said Demoyan, director of The Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute in Yerevan, Armenia's capital.

"It is a fear of facing historical reality and causing a total collapse of the ideological axis that modern republican Turkey was formed around. Turks get panicked when you compare Atatürk's legacy to Lenin.

Atatürk was sentenced to death in absentia by a military judge to punish war crimes during the first world war. There are documents from non-Armenian sources listing him as a war criminal ."

Demoyan's remarks come amid fledgling attempts to re-establish links between two countries which have not had diplomatic relations since 1994, following a war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Turkey's ally.

Tentative efforts towards normalising ties occurred this month when the Turkish president, Abdullah Gül, visited Yerevan to attend a World Cup football match between Turkey and Armenia at the invitation of his Armenian counterpart, Serge Sarkisian.

Unlike most visiting heads of state, Gül did not visit the genocide museum, which displays documentary and photographic exhibits proving, Armenian officials say, that their ethnic brethren were subjected to deliberate genocide. Turkey vehemently denies this and has jailed Turkish citizens who argued otherwise. However, rising numbers of Turkish tourists and journalists have visited the museum recently.

"More than 500 Turks have visited this year. They've come in unprecedented numbers," Demoyan said. "Their reaction is one of shock. At first there is denial. Sometimes they ask: 'What is our sin?' or 'How can we be responsible for this?'. It's not taught in Turkish schools, so we understand their reaction."

Turkey claims the Armenian death toll has been exaggerated and that most victims died from starvation or disease. It also argues that many Turks were killed by Armenian groups.

Effective targeting of tumor vasculature by the angiogenesis inhibitors vasostatin and interleukin-12.
Solid tumors are dependent on preexisting vasculature and neovascularization for their growth. Successful cancer therapies targeting the tumor vasculature would be expected to block the existing tumor blood supply and to prevent tumor neovascularization. We tested the antitumor activity of experimental therapy with 2 distinct antiangiogenic drugs. Vasostatin inhibits endothelial cell growth and neovascularization, and interleukin-12 (IL-12) targets the tumor vasculature acting through interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and the downstream chemokines interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and monokine induced by IFN-gamma. Individually, vasostatin and IL-12 produced distinct efficacy profiles in trials aimed at reducing tumor growth in athymic mice. In combination, these inhibitors halted the growth of human Burkitt lymphoma, colon carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma. Thus, cancer therapy that combines distinct inhibitors of angiogenesis is a novel, effective strategy for the experimental treatment of cancer. (Blood. 2000;96:1900-1905)

Last on the controversial surveillance system.. “I am writing to insist that AT&T take proactive steps to prevent the unrestricted disclosure and potential abuse of private customer data, including real-time location information, by at least one other company to the government,” a May 8 letter sent from Wyden to the President and Chief Executive Officer of AT&T reads.. As reported by the New York Times, a former sheriff of Mississippi County, Mo., used an obscure service called Securus to surve authorization to use the service, the report suggests.. “The fact that Securus provides this service at all suggests that AT&T does not sufficiently control access to your customers’ private information,” the letter adds...

SEOUL, Jan. 21 (Yonhap) -- Pantech Corp. said Monday that the U.S. mobile chip manufacturer Qualcomm Inc. will increase its stake in the South Korean handset maker by converting Pantech's royalty debts into equity.. According to Pantech, Qualcomm will buy some 52 million Pantech shares worth US$23 million with its overdue loyalty claims, raising its overall stake in the No. 3 South Korean mobile phone maker to 13.49 percent from the current 11.46 percent.. Qualcomm earlier had converted Pantech's royalty debts worth $75 million into equity, becoming the company's second largest shareholder. State-run Korea Development Bank is currently the largest shareholder with a 13.39 percent.. Pantech said that whether Qualcomm will become its largest shareholder depends on the currency rate.)

Space is an exciting and dangerous place. Hope you are prepared.

Starpoint Gemini Warlords is the type of space adventure players have been looking for. The perfect blend of RPG and 4X gameplay elements that complement each other greatly. Created by Little Green Men Games, the Starpoint series has been a success ever since their initial release back in 2010. Warlords is the third installment of the series, and Little Green Man Games has it in early access to have the gamer community and developers discuss where improvements and tweaks can be made. Space exploration titles are difficult to sell because let's be honest, space is the easiest environment to use in a game. Why is it then that the Starpoint Series shines where others fail? What makes it so great and why do people want to play them?

Starpoint Gemini Warlord’s many aspects and community involvement is the answer to those questions.

4X titles are hard to get into, let alone stay involved. 4X stands for explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate. That's a lot for one person to take on immediately. Players sometimes feel intimidated by more complex games, which leads to anger, frustration, and hate for a certain title. Series that fall into that genre are not always loved or even liked. They end up being frequently played anyway, as people do enjoy spending time learning and improving skills.

Starpoint Gemini series takes this genre on and does it quite well. Learning the systems, building, and ship controls are intuitive and easy to understand. I got destroyed the first time I came across a battalion of enemies, but I wasn't frustrated about it. I wanted to know what I needed to annihilate my enemies, and so I learned.

Spending the time to learn aspects of the Starpoint Gemini Warlords was rewarding in its own regard. Learning different weapon systems, battle tactics, and what to upgrade only made me want to explore the universe more even though I knew I would encounter death again and again. Not many titles do that to me the same way as Warlords has. A similar title was released in 2015 named Rebel Galaxy, which was a more simplified type of space shooter. Players controlled a ship that could be upgraded and exchanged out for a more powerful ship, completed missions for money or reputation, and of course tried to find your missing Aunt. While Rebel Galaxy was great, it was primarily a space naval-style battle where there was no moving along the Z plane (up or down). Having the movement restriction during battles was a bummer and besides that point, Rebel Galaxy became very linear as the missions became redundant.

Starpoint Gemini Warlords avoids those pitfalls.

The story line in engaging and compels the player to move forward to find out more about the lore of the universe find more answers. Charater creation for a Captain is a fun and immersive way to personify your adventure. It adds to the idea that you, the player, are in command of your ship and responsible for your crew's well-being, while of course, being tasked with discovering the universe.

Starpoint Gemini Warlords is a great title for any player that is attracted to space, exploration, RPG’s, and 4X games. The community and developers working together, through Steam’s Early Access, is what shapes and forms the game, from a concept to a commercial product, and one that everyone will enjoy. The PR Spokesperson for Little Green Men Games, Zeno Žokalj, spoke with us here at OPNoobs and explained the importance of Early Access and what the studios' plans were for the remainder of development. Zeno stated that “lots of ideas Starpoint Gemini 2 saw but did not find will be implemented in Warlords.” He went on to explain how the community's involvement with the title has made his personal experience a great one, and that he is excited to see the outcome of Warlords.

Little Green Men Games is bringing a lot to the table: an unofficial but all-the-more meaningful partnership, between the community and a development studio, to work together and create what, we hope, will be a fantastic experience for all those involved.

Mixing and Blending System

Custom Powder Systems manufactured a 5000-l blender for a customer that fits and can be loaded and discharged within limited manufacturing space and low ceiling heights. The CPS 20 offset blender angle uses the blender sides as baffles and causes the material to cross flow as it is being tumbled. Because of the weight of the blending vessel and its contents, CPS manufactured a bottle in support cage design as a cost savings to its client. In addition, CPS designed an automated vertical bin lift and shuttle system to transport raw ingredients in hopper bottom bins, discharge the bin into the new blending vessel, blend the ingredients using an automated “recipe” for RPMs and blending time, and discharge back into transport bins for transfer to the tablet press. This is an automated CIP system that includes booster and detergent pumps that cleans and dries the blending vessel for the next formulation. CPS custom designed, fabricated, automated, and tested the entire system.

The modern electron microscope has extended the range of human vision to objects several hundred times smaller than those which can be seen with the light microscope. It has revealed structure where none could be seen previously and where little was thought to exist.. This remarkably precise scientific instrument, the potential resolving power of which is still to be fully realized, has produced a broad reawakening of interest in the fine structure of biological material and has demonstrated the existence of order in dimensions which previously were invisible.. For their major contribution to the design, construction, development and perfection of the electron microscope which led to the creation of a unique and much used research instrument, this joint award is gratefully presented to Dr. Ernst Ruska and Dr. James Hillier.

On Saturday we discover the beautiful countryside of the Ardennes and some of it’s most famous climbs.. Liege-Bastogne-Liege is the oldest classic and considered to be the fairest. The strongest man usually wins this race. And it’s not hard to see why.. From the 20% gradients of the Cote de la Redoute and the Cote de Stockeu to the long drawn-out climbs of the Col du Rosier and the Cote de Vecquée, you will find out first hand what it’s like to ride this classic.. We’ll start in the town of Remouchamps, at the foot of La Redoute. From there we will make a loop of 100 km that comprises a whopping 2,000 altitude meters. And this is probably the easier of the 2 days…. If you prefer a more laid back approach to the cycling part of the trip then we’ll shorten the ride so as to leave ample time to sample the abbey beers at the Stavelot abbey.. And to close the sporting part of the day in style we’ll have a drink in Philippe Gilbert’s home pub and have a look at some of the memorabilia that are displayed there.

Q:

Do I need Norton Internet Security if my Windows 8 machine has Windows Defender?

I got a new Windows 8 laptop. It comes with Norton Internet Security pre-installed. Do I need this if Windows 8 comes with Windows Defender?
Can I safely uninstall Norton Internet Security?

A:

I'm guessing your Norton Internet Security, is on a free trial basis only. If you are unwilling to pay once the free trial is over, free and effective alternatives are available to Norton (and Windows Defender - if desired, previously known as Microsoft Security Essentials in Windows 7)

conduct a google search for free antivirus.

WebView for Android

Since Android 4.4 (KitKat), the WebView component is based on the Chromium
open source project. WebViews now include an updated version of the V8
JavaScript engine and support for modern web standards
previously missing in old WebViews.
New Webviews also share the same rendering engine as Chrome for Android,
so rendering should be much more consistent between the WebView and Chrome.

In Android 5.0 (Lollipop), the WebView has moved to an APK
so it can be updated seperately to the Android platform.
To see what version of Chrome is currently used on a Lollipop device,
simply go to Settings < Apps < Android System WebView
and look at the version.

WebView FAQ

What version of Chrome is it based on?

The WebView shipped with Android 4.4 (KitKat) is based on the same code as
Chrome for Android version 30. This WebView does not have full feature parity with
Chrome for Android and is given the version number 30.0.0.0.

The updated WebView shipped with Android 4.4.3 has the version number 33.0.0.0.

Caution: You cannot publish apps using the L Developer Preview to the Google Play store.

The WebView in Android L can be updated via the Play Store, so you need to
check the latest version on the device under App Settings.

Will the new WebView auto-update?

The WebView will auto-update for mobile devices with Android L and above.

For future proofing you app, you can use the Beta WebView to test
versions of the WebView before it's launched.
Checkout this
[Android Developer blog post for more details](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/02/beta-channel-for-android-webview.html).

What does the new WebView mean for developers?

This is a big change from the original WebView as it brings a new set of HTML5
feature support, improved JavaScript performance, and remote debugging of web
content using the Chrome DevTools.

799 So.2d 829 (2001)
Janet Patrice NASH
v.
Michael Lynn NASH.
No. 01-766.
Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Third Circuit.
October 31, 2001.
Martha Ann O'Neal, DeRidder, LA, Counsel for Plaintiff/Appellee: Janet Patrice Nash.
Charles A. Sam Jones, III, DeRidder, LA, Counsel for Defendant/Appellant: Michael Lynn Nash.
Court composed of JOHN D. SAUNDERS, BILLIE COLOMBARO WOODARD, and MARC T. AMY, Judges.
BILLIE COLOMBARO WOODARD, Judge.
Mr. and Ms. Nash divorced on September 20, 1993, based on a petition that was *830 filed on December 21, 1992, the date on which the community ended. Almost one year later, Ms. Nash filed a petition for the partition of the community property. The trial court held the partition trial on May 29, 1996, entered an order on August 24, 2000, and signed the judgment on February 1, 2001.
Mr. Nash appeals the partition order, contending that the trial court erred in awarding Ms. Nash a credit for payments, which she made on the community automobile with her separate funds, since she had the exclusive use of it. Additionally, he contends that the court erred in disallowing his claim for reimbursement of one-half of the community indebtedness owed to Discover Card Financial Services.

* * * * *

THE AUTOMOBILE
During the marriage, Mr. and Ms. Nash purchased a 1990 Pontiac Grand Am. Ms. Nash had exclusive use and possession of it. At the partition trial, the parties stipulated that the balance owed on its mortgage was $7,000.00 at the time of the community's termination. Consistent with La.Civ.Code art. 2365, the trial court awarded Ms. Nash reimbursement/credit for payments, which she had made on the indebtedness after the termination of the community. Mr. Nash alleges that Ms. Nash is not entitled to reimbursement for any portion of her payments, made on the vehicle, from December 21, 1992, the time of the community's termination, to the trial date. He relies on Preis v. Preis,[1] and Bergeron v. Bergeron,[2] two cases from this circuit, which stand for the proposition that a spouse, who has exclusive use of a vehicle, following the termination of the community, is not entitled to reimbursement or a credit for the money paid on it.
The Preis and Bergeron rules are jurisprudential exceptions to the general rule, found in La.Civ.Code art. 2365, which provides:
If separate property of a spouse has been used to satisfy a community obligation, that spouse, upon termination of the community property regime, is entitled to reimbursement for one-half of the amount or value that the property had at the time it was used. The liability of a spouse who owes reimbursement is limited to the value of his share in the community after deduction of all community obligations.
Nevertheless, if the community obligation was incurred for the ordinary and customary expenses of the marriage, or for the support, maintenance, and education of children of either spouse in keeping with the economic condition of the community, the spouse is entitled to reimbursement from the other spouse regardless of the value of that spouse's share of the community.
We find that Preis and Bergeron are inconsistent with our interpretation of La. Civ.Code art. 2365 and decline to follow them. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's decision on this issue.

MS. NASH'S ANSWER TO THE APPEAL
In her answer, Ms. Nash requests that if we disallow her reimbursement for the separate funds, which she paid on the automobile debt, we recalculate the equalization payment, which she received. Our decision above pretermits consideration of this issue.


*831 THE DISCOVER CARD
At the trial, Mr. Nash testified as to an alleged community debt, concerning Discover Card, which Ms. Nash denied. The trial court delayed ruling on this issue and left the record open to permit Mr. Nash to furnish a full account history of the debt. However, in its order, the court stated that no information, relative to the Discover Card, had been received, and it disallowed the claim for reimbursement.
In his brief, Mr. Nash's counsel alleges that he furnished the information to the trial court, following the hearing, by providing the court with a copy of the statement from Discover Card Financial Services on July 1, 1997 and again on March 13, 2000. He states that the statement reflected a balance of $1,669.51 as of December 2, 1992. And, his counsel attached a copy of this statement to his brief, noting that the record, before us, does not contain it.
We may not consider attachments to briefs, which are not a part of the record, as we cannot go beyond the record in rendering a decision.[3]
All that we have before us is the trial court's assertion that it never received Mr. Nash's statement. Although, the record contains copies of checks, which Mr. Nash wrote after termination of the community in order to pay the Discover Card debt, these checks do not establish that the debt was a community debt. Additionally, after the community ended, Mr. Nash's affidavits of income and expense, which were submitted in connection with the divorce case, listed the Discover Card debt as his expense. Listing it as a debt in another proceeding, without more, does not establish it to be a community debt. This was the reason that the trial court permitted the record to remain open for supplementation with the Discover Card's account history.
Given the evidence in this record, we find no error in trial court's decision to disallow Mr. Nash's claim for reimbursement of one-half of the Discover Card debt and affirm that decision, as well.

CONCLUSION
We find no error in the trial court's decisions, concerning Ms. Nash's credit for the car notes, which she paid on the community vehicle with separate funds, and in disallowing Mr. Nash a credit for one-half of the Discover Card debt, for which he failed to prove his entitlement. We affirm and cast Mr. Nash with all appeal costs.

Gâteaux derivative. weak derivative. The derivative of a functional or a mapping which — together with the Fréchet derivative (the strong derivative) — is most frequently used in infinite-dimensional analysis. The Gâteaux derivative at a point $x_0$ of a mapping $f:X\to Y$ from a linear topological space $X$ into a linear topological space $Y$ is the continuous linear mapping $f'_G(x_0):X\to Y$ that satisfies the condition \begin{equation*} f(x_0 + h) = f(x_0)+f'_G(x_0)h + \epsilon(h), \end{equation*}. where $\epsilon(th)/ t \to 0$ as $t\to 0$ in the topology of $Y$ (see also Gâteaux variation). If the mapping $f$ has a Gâteaux derivative at the point $x_0$, it is called Gâteaux differentiable. The theorem on differentiation of a composite function is usually invalid for the Gâteaux derivative. See also Differentiation of a mapping.. References. References. Gâteaux derivative.

CD44 gene vaccination for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in non-obese diabetic mice.
Standard CD44 and its alternatively spliced variants were found to be associated with the metastatic potential of tumor cells and with cell migration of autoimmune inflammatory cells, including cells involved in experimental insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. To investigate whether induction of anti-CD44 immune reactivity, through cDNA vaccination, could attenuate IDDM in a transfer model of NOD mice. Our vaccination technique involved the insertion of CD44s or CD44v cDNA into a silicone tube filled with a 2.5 cm long segment of hydroxylated-polyvinyl acetate wound dressing sponge (forming a virtual lymph node) which was implanted under the skin of male NOD recipients reconstituted with diabetogenic spleen cells of female NOD donors. The VLN were implanted 20 days before and 3 days after cell transfer. In contrast to control groups of recipient mice, recipients vaccinated with VLN loaded with CD44v or CD44s cDNAs developed resistance to IDDM almost to the same extent. Our results suggest that the gene vaccination effect was mediated by anti-CD44 antibody rather than by cellular immunity. Histopathological examinations revealed a significant protection of pancreatic islets in the DNA-vaccinated recipients, whereas the islets of control recipients of diabetogenic cells were almost totally destroyed. These findings may open new opportunities for IDDM therapy in the future.

I have mine under the post header (but mine are custom post types, and not like blog posts) and made sure to put enough space between the social buttons and the ads so there couldn't be any accidental clicks.. Dunno how it affects CTR - could be a lot, could be not at all. It's definitely another distraction. But everyone who shares something of mine on Twitter or Facebook tends to bring in a few more users, who then are likely to come back, and ever so slightly increase my brand and reduce my dependency on Google. So overall, if I have to give up a few bucks worth of clicks to get that, I'm okay with it.

These defects have been shown to be at higher risk of disease progression in subjects who had not received systematic periodontal therapy. These bony lesions may not be readily accessible to periodontal debridement, often requiring access flap surgery alone or in combination with bone resective techniques or regenerative procedures . Different modalities of regenerative treatment have been developed. Amongst these, grafting of biomaterials and application of biological agents have been used with varying success to accomplish the reconstruction of lost attachment apparatus in deep intraosseous defects.

Back again.. By terryh on Oct 18, 2005. I took a bit of a blog break. I was feeling somewhat negative, and the advice is to not post under those conditions, lest you say something you might regret. But the pressure is off, at least a little, so I'm back. Today, I was inspired by the most interesting blog in the world. So here it is: multi-colored chard with garlic and onions, over rice noodles..

摘要. Multiple-energy oxygen ion implantation was used for AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) isolation. The devices fabricated using this technique had high saturation current of 668mA/mm with maximum current of 833mA/mm, high off-state breakdown voltage of 87V for 4.5μm G-D spacing devices and high peak transconductance of 288mS/mm. Meanwhile, the leakage current was only 250pA for 75μm width pad under 20V reverse bias. The current slump behavior was also suppressed as compared to the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs using ICP mesa dry etch for isolation. XTEM micrographs of the as-implanted and 300□ l hour post-annealed samples were taken and compared with data of the the leakage current. Overall, this study shows that the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs device performance was improved by using multi-energy oxygen ion implantation isolation process as compared with the device formed by conventional dry etch mesa isolation.

# AppSequence Validation Rules

AppSequence information contained in WS-Discovery announcement and response messages ([Hello](hello-message.md), [ProbeMatches](probematches-message.md), and [ResolveMatches](resolvematches-message.md)). This information is processed and validated by WSDAPI before these messages are passed on to components above the stack (such as Network Explorer or an application calling into WSDAPI).

The following XML shows a sample AppSequence element. The wsd prefix refers to the namespace `https://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery`.

``` syntax
<wsd:AppSequence InstanceId="2"
    SequenceId="urn:uuid:369a7d7b-5f87-48a4-aa9a-189edf2a8772"
    MessageNumber="21">
</wsd:AppSequence>
```

WSDAPI ignores stale messages. For each device (uniquely identified by the Endpoint Address in the SOAP Body), WSDAPI ignores any messages with an AppSequence MessageNumber lower than the last message seen.

WSDAPI ignores stale XAddr announcements. If the AppSequence InstanceId is lower than the last InstanceId seen, WSDAPI ignores the XAddrs advertised in the SOAP body. Also, if the InstanceId is the same as previous but the MetadataVersion is lower than the last MetadataVersion, WSDAPI ignores the XAddrs.

WSDAPI ignores duplicate WS-Discovery messages. If two identical WS-Discovery messages are sent to WSDAPI, only the first received will be processed. This is typically only relevant for applications that call directly into the [**IWSDiscoveryPublisher**](/windows/desktop/api/WsdDisco/nn-wsddisco-iwsdiscoverypublisher) or [**IWSDiscoveryProvider**](/windows/desktop/api/WsdDisco/nn-wsddisco-iwsdiscoveryprovider) interfaces.

This very important story may change how afib patients and their doctors decide if they should be on anticoagulant medications (blood thinners), such as Coumadin or warfarin.. The CHADS2 scoring system is how doctors now decide who should be on Coumadin or warfarin to avoid strokes, but a newly-published study adds new stroke risk factors that are not considered in CHADS2.. These new risk factors, including being female, having heart or vascular disease, and being age 65 or greater (CHADS2 uses 75 or greater), have been incorporated in a scoring system called the “2009 Birmingham Schema” (CHA2DS2-VASc). This new approach enhances the existing CHADS2 system, giving two points to definitive stroke risk factors and one point to combination stroke risk factors..

The 28-year-old is quoted by the Daily Mail as saying: "If Germany play anything like Bayern Munich have been playing, Northern Ireland might have a chance".

Northern Ireland is now second in Group C with 19 points, just five points behind first-place Germany.

Germany begin the match five points clear of Northern Ireland, who have guaranteed second spot in Group C and would seal one of the eight play-off berths were they to win.

Ireland is the European Union economy most vulnerable to Brexit, and keeping the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland open after Brexit is one of three divorce topics, along with citizens' rights and money owed by the U.K, that require "sufficient progress" before the European Union will allow talks to move on to the future relationship.

Conventional plugs and/or connectors connect electrical devices and/or loads to an Alternating Current (AC) power source. The AC power connection from the AC power source to the load may include several terminals such as the power signal, i.e., the “hot” terminal, a neutral terminal, and/or a ground terminal. The correct ordering and/or orientation of the wiring of the these terminals in the connector is important in order to prevent damage to the electrical devices or load to which the connector supplies power.
The wiring of the AC power in the connector is typically verified by plugging the connector to a test fixture before plugging the connector to an electrical device or load, to avoid damage to the electrical device or load in the event that the wiring of the AC power in the connector is incorrect. However, plugging into a separate test fixture may be a cumbersome extra step when using power connectors. Furthermore, after testing of the connector is completed, future operation of the connector and general “wear and tear” of the terminals and/or the connector may cause terminals in the connector to detach and/or lose the ability to make a proper connection.

Taco Bell's Snapchat Game Is Strong Among Teens, But Does It Sell Tacos?

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Youth Radio Courtesy of Youth Radio

Here are two obvious statements: One, many teenagers love fast food. Two, many of them hate listening to adults. And these are real problems if you're a fast food company.

Increasingly, companies like Taco Bell and McDonald's are trying very hard to reach teens like me by using social media. Over the past few months, I've been working with NPR business reporter Sonari Glinton to examine how well some of these campaigns are working — including asking some of my friends at Youth Radio to weigh in.

While they generally like the humor in brand campaigns, Nila Venkat explains: "It makes me think they are funny on social media. Doesn't mean I want to eat their hash browns."

That doesn't surprise Lauren Johnson, a digital marketing reporter at Adweek. "Social media and millennial marketing is an extremely tough area for brands right now," she says. "The agencies tend to be a bit older, so they're trying to understand what millennials talk about with their friends, and how that can be translated into marketing that feels that same way."

On the one hand, the goal of these companies isn't new. Since the birth of modern marketing, businesses have been trying to reach the elusive teenager. But as Sonari points out, when he was a teen 23 years ago, marketing was a form of one-way communication — companies speaking to teens via TV commercials or print ads. New technology has brought new expectations. Teens today expect brands to engage with them online 24/7. And some companies are doing a better job than others.

Marketing experts say Taco Bell's laid-back approach is one to watch. But it's tough to say how much, if any, of its success is due to social-media savvy. So we decide to go to the belly of the beast — the belly of the Bell, if you will — Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine, Calif.

Taco Bell's command center is as cool as can be for a corporate office. The break room has a soda fountain complete with Taco Bell cups. We meet with the company's chief marketing officer, Marisa Thalberg, in a room called "the fishbowl."

"We have lots of screens where we can see everything that's going on in social media about the brand and about the world," Thalberg says of the room. "Which is great, because it keeps us really plugged in."

toggle caption Courtesy of Youth Radio

Taco Bell prides itself on being a pioneer in engaging with consumers on social media platforms like Snapchat and Twitter. This past November, taking advantage of the newly created taco emoji, the company launched a social campaign called #TacoEmojiEngine, consisting of 600 gifs and photos.

Thalberg explains how it works: "If you tweet at Taco Bell and type the taco emoji plus any other emoji, you're going to get tweeted back an original piece of content. You could do it right now, while we're talking. Go to Twitter."

So we do. One of my producers tweets a taco and a unicorn emoji. Within seconds, she receives a video of a horse eating a taco and turning into a unicorn.

Cool, I think. But it doesn't really make me want to eat Taco Bell.

And that's the thing: Just because a brand makes teens laugh doesn't mean they'll buy its products, or confirm that the companies are even on the right track.

I tell Thalberg that I think Taco Bell's social media brand is interesting in that it is "self-aware."

There's a big pause.

"What do you mean by self-aware?" she asks.

I think about it. "Like, hmmm ... like a stoner-at-midnight vibe," I say.

Quicker than you can tweet a video of a taco-eating unicorn, she says: "I really don't think that's our vibe. I think that implies ... the stereotype of Taco Bell, but not at all who we are. I think what makes us unique is that there's an authenticity to who we are that makes us feel like a likable friend."

She acknowledges that this sounds like a typical brand response. And it does. In my opinion, that's too bad. Why don't they just embrace the stoner vibe? Maybe that would give them the kind of authenticity that appeals to the tricky teen demographic.

But it's clear to me and Sonari that fast food brands don't always understand what it's like to be a teenager. And even if they do manage to impress teens someday, those kids will soon become adults — and companies will have to move on to the next group of teens ... and the next media revolution.

This story is part of a series reported in collaboration with Youth Radio on the future of fast food. NPR business reporter Sonari Glinton contributed to this report.

In 1987 the local police had employed an attack against the wagon community causing an uprise of social solidarity including large demonstrations in support of Zaffaraya. 1989 produced more demonstrations which produced a move to a more permanent location in the Neufeld area.

I don’t really know, I don’t understand how it feels: to live in a rich European country, which is rich mainly because it has been directly plundering many poor nations around the world. Or it has been plundering by association, through its membership in some extremist organization like NATO. To live there, refusing to acknowledge why it is rich, how it became rich.

Palaces, theatres, railroads, hospitals and parks in that rich country are built on broken skeletons and restless specters, on lakes of blood and shameless theft.

Then, when one looted country after another begins to sink, when there is nothing left there, when children begin dying from hunger and when men commence fighting each other over tiny boulders and dirty pieces of turf, pathetic boats, or dinghies, begin crossing the waterways, bringing half starved, half-mad refugees to the European sea-fronts decorated with marble.

What a horrifying sight! As if a woman, her hair waving in disarray, her lips broken, comes begging a man who raped her after killing her husband – begging for shelter and at least some work and piece of bread. She decided to abandon all her pride, because her children are sick and starving, because it is either this, or death.

That is what you reduced the world to, Europe – you, and your huge, insatiable offspring – North America!

Too egocentric, too cruel, you lost the ability to judge, to feel. All moral standards collapsed. There are no higher principles, anymore, only self-interest.

In Calais and Kos, in Paris, London, Stuttgart, and Prague, I heard the same questions posed with absolutely straight faces: “How are we going to absorb all those hordes of immigrants?”

Almost no one in the West is wondering aloud: “How did the people on other continents manage to endure those long centuries of colonialism and neo-colonialism, of shameless plunder, of slavery, of constant locust-like onslaught of corporate and neoliberal cannibalistic hordes? Wouldn’t a set of keys issued to each and every citizen of robbed, formerly or presently colonized country, be the tiniest, the most basic token of justice?”

Congolese refugees in Goma.

Is it morally acceptable that a thief, an arsonist, a rapist, a liar, a serial killer, all in one, would be allowed to live in a mansion, surrounded by slums housing his victims?

In the West, in the Christian West, in fundamentalist West, such arrangement is obviously tolerable.

38 year old female after breasting feeding her 3 children lost her previous full perky breasts. She was very self conscious of her deflated breasts and had difficulty filling out a swimming suit tops. She felt uncomfortable when she was intimate with her husband and didn’t ever want to be seen naked. She simply wanted a very natural fuller sexier look.. Dr Koo used a higher profile silicone breast implant placed under the muscle to give her the soft natural slope she desired. Dr Koo was able to give the breasts a lift without having to place additional long scars on her breasts with the type of implant she chose and the technique she uses.. The patient is thrilled with her fuller, voluptuous breasts that are completely proportional for her body. She feels they suit her profession and lifestyle. She’s also delighted that her husband likes them even more than she anticipated despite his original objection to her getting breast augmentation!!

For a while now, my PKI in Aerospace
Consulting company has been working on finding ways to
make PKI more usable. From the "Relying Party" side of the
equation, I think we're getting fairly close. Between some
of the advances that others have made (such as Microsoft
CAPI now doing Path Discovery and Validation mostly
correctly), and our own work on writing an open source Path
Discovery and Validation Daemon that can be used by
programs like Apache and
Free
Radius, I think there is very little reason why
someone could not actually build a site and fully use
certificates for authentication (especially with the certificate
information patches that we've just published for
Apache).

Now, the problems we're seeing are on the pure client
side, such as in browsers, mail
clients, VPN clients, or wireless clients in the open source
world. The nice thing about the proprietary world of
Microsoft and Apple is that they, for the most part, all use
their platform certificate store (CAPI on Microsoft, and the
KeyChain on Apple). In the open source world, certificates,
keys and trust anchors can be just about anyplace. And, most
annoyingly, even applications built by the same projects
don't even use the same certificate stores (I'm looking at
you, Firefox and Thunderbird, and you too KMail and
Konqueror). So, consider this a call for someone (maybe the
LSB folks) to come up with a full standard that everyone can
adopt for both trust anchors and user keys/certificates, and
then please, please, everyone use that1.

[1] - Yes, I know WHY Firefox and Thunderbird have their own
store: so that they don't have to implement per-platform
solutions, thereby easing their FIPS validation. At the
very least, they COULD implement a common certificate store
used by both (and any other LibNSS-using application). At
least then I wouldn't have to install all of my certificates
twice. If the Mozilla folks wanted to really endear
themselves to the community, they would also, once a single
store is in place, at least give an install-time
option for those that need it to use the system certificate
stores, instead of the LibNSS specific store.

Morocco registers record 11.35 million tourists in 2017. Rabat, Feb 13 (IANS/MAP) Morocco registered a record of 11.35 million tourists in 2017, up by 10 per cent compared to a year earlier, according to the statistics released by Tourism Ministry on Tuesday.. Arrivals from the traditional European markets showed an increase of 15 per cent in German tourists, 9 per cent in Dutch and Italian tourists.. About 8 per cent increase was recorded in the arrivals of French and Spanish visitors. The increase was also driven by the surge in the emerging tourist markets especially China, Japan and Brazil.. Chinese arrivals jumped 151 per cent, while Japanese and Brazilian visitors rose 39 and 38 per cent respectively.. Morocco’s main tourist destinations, Marrakesh and Agadir, witnessed 17 and 11 per cent increase in tourist arrivals, while the old city of Fez and the desert town of Ouarzazate showed the highest increase with a growth of 39 and 37 per cent.. –IANS/MAP. soni/vm

Brushing Up on Healthy Teeth

Keeping your teeth healthy sounds simple: Brush and floss twice a day and see your dentist twice a year. The trouble is, simple as that sounds, you may need to know more. It's not that dental health is hard—it's easy. But give this true-false quiz a try to see just how much you know about keeping your teeth their brightest, whitest, and healthiest.

1. You must brush and floss your teeth after every meal to prevent gum disease and cavities.

You didn't answer this question.

You answered

The correct answer is

Although brushing after every meal can’t hurt, it is not always needed. Once a day would be enough if you took 5 to 10 minutes to thoroughly brush and floss your teeth. But most people don't have the time or desire to spend that much time. So a good rule of thumb, say the experts, is to brush twice a day with toothpaste that has fluoride. Floss thoroughly once a day. Brushing and flossing before bed is especially important. This is because it removes leftover food and debris that help bacteria grow in your mouth at night, when your flow of saliva is at its lowest.

A. True
B. False

2. Brushing your teeth with an up-and-down or side-to-side motion is the best way to clean your teeth.

You didn't answer this question.

You answered

The correct answer is

One of the better ways is to move your toothbrush in a circle. This is called the Modified Bass Technique. This circular motion picks up the plaque on your teeth and sweeps it out. The other ways of brushing only move the plaque and push it against other surfaces. You should hold your brush at a 45-degree angle to the gum line to clean your teeth. Let the bristles reach just beneath the gum line.

A. True
B. False

3. You can floss your teeth by simply putting the floss between your teeth and pulling it through.

You didn't answer this question.

You answered

The correct answer is

To floss properly put the floss tightly against the side of each tooth and slide it up to the top edge and back down under the gum line. You will miss a lot of plaque if you just slide the floss in and pull it through. You can choose from different kinds of floss to make it easier to floss between dental work and tight spaces. You can buy floss as a tape, regular or fine, and waxed or unwaxed, as well as in a variety of flavors.

Both manual and motored or powered toothbrushes can clean your teeth well.

A. True
B. False

5. Brushing too much can harm your gums.

You didn't answer this question.

You answered

The correct answer is

Researchers have found that this is not true. Some experts say brushing your teeth the incorrect way can harm your gums. It can make your gums recede and wear away the tooth surface.

A. True
B. False

6. You should use a dental rinse along with brushing and flossing to remove plaque.

You didn't answer this question.

You answered

The correct answer is

Dental rinses that say they remove extra plaque have not been scientifically proved to do so. But rinses that have fluoride can help prevent cavities and freshen your breath. Fluoride is the only substance that prevents tooth decay. It also makes your tooth enamel stronger. Prescription mouth rinses help reduce the amount of certain bacteria in plaque.

A. True
B. False

7. Toothpastes that contain baking soda and hydrogen peroxide can help reduce plaque acids made by plaque bacteria.

You didn't answer this question.

You answered

The correct answer is

This is actually true. Baking soda neutralizes acids in the plaque. Baking soda and hydrogen peroxide combine with saliva to produce oxygen. Oxygen kills the plaque bacteria. Other toothpastes can help reduce or get rid of stains. These toothpastes generally work only on stains caused by cigarette smoke, coffee, and tea. These stains appear only on the outer surface of teeth. Deeper stains caused by some medicines or health conditions must be treated by your dentist.

A. True
B. False

8. You should see your dentist twice a year for checkups and cleanings.

You didn't answer this question.

You answered

The correct answer is

It depends. If you're healthy, 2 times a year is a good starting point. But if you have has gum disease, if you smoke, or if you have a disease that affects your whole body such as diabetes, you should probably see your dentist more often because these can make gum disease worse. Some medicines also make it more likely for you to get gum disease and cavities because they reduce the flow of saliva. If you take good care of your teeth, eat a healthy diet, and have little or no history of dental disease, you may not need to be seen so often.

A. True
B. False

9. If your parents lost all their teeth to tooth decay or gum disease, you will too.

You didn't answer this question.

You answered

The correct answer is

Absolutely false. Dental disease is one of the few diseases in the world that can be totally prevented and cured. All it needs is taking the time to brush and floss your teeth properly. You should also avoid snacking on sugary or starchy foods, and see your dentist regularly for examinations, teeth cleaning, and advice.

We have streamlined and revamped the manner in which we handle our criminal cases so that the victims of crime receive their justice in a more timely manner. We have prioritized violent and career offenders, complex crimes and human trafficking for particularly aggressive prosecution attention and we have created a cooperative interagency unit that focuses on elder abuse and vulnerable adult protection.”.

Q:

Iterating through the union of several Java Map key sets efficiently

In one of my Java 6 projects I have an array of LinkedHashMap instances as input to a method which has to iterate through all keys (i.e. through the union of the key sets of all maps) and work with the associated values. Not all keys exist in all maps and the method should not go through each key more than once or alter the input maps.
My current implementation looks like this:
Set<Object> keyset = new HashSet<Object>();

for (Map<Object, Object> map : input) {
    for (Object key : map.keySet()) {
        if (keyset.add(key)) {
            ...
        }
    }
}

The HashSet instance ensures that no key will be acted upon more than once.
Unfortunately this part of the code is rather critical performance-wise, as it is called very frequently. In fact, according to the profiler over 10% of the CPU time is spent in the HashSet.add() method.
I am trying to optimise this code us much as possible. The use of LinkedHashMap with its more efficient iterators (in comparison to the plain HashMap) was a significant boost, but I was hoping to reduce what is essentially book-keeping time to the minimum.
Putting all the keys in the HashSet before-hand, by using addAll() proved to be less efficient, due to the cost of calling HashSet.contains() afterwards.
At the moment I am looking at whether I can use a bitmap (well, a boolean[] to be exact) to avoid the HashSet completely, but it may not be possible at all, depending on my key range.
Is there a more efficient way to do this? Preferrably something that will not pose restrictions on the keys?
EDIT:
A few clarifications and comments:

I do need all the values from the maps - I cannot drop any of them.
I also need to know which map each value came from. The missing part (...) in my code would be something like this:
for (Map<Object, Object> m : input) {
    Object v = m.get(key);

    // Do something with v
}

A simple example to get an idea of what I need to do with the maps would be to print all maps in parallel like this:
Key Map0 Map1 Map2
F   1    null 2
B   2    3    null
C   null null 5
...

That's not what I am actually doing, but you should get the idea.
The input maps are extremely variable. In fact, each call of this method uses a different set of them. Therefore I would not gain anything by caching the union of their keys.
My keys are all String instances. They are sort-of-interned on the heap using a separate HashMap, since they are pretty repetitive, therefore their hash code is already cached and most hash validations (when the HashMap implementation is checking whether two keys are actually equal, after their hash codes match) boil down to an identity comparison (==). The profiler confirms that only 0.5% of the CPU time is spent on String.equals() and String.hashCode().

EDIT 2:
Based on the suggestions in the answers, I made a few tests, profiling and benchmarking along the way. I ended up with roughly a 7% increase in performance. What I did:

I set the initial capacity of the HashSet to double the collective size of all input maps. This gained me something in the region of 1-2%, by eliminating most (all?) resize() calls in the HashSet.
I used Map.entrySet() for the map I am currently iterating. I had originally avoided this approach due to the additional code and the fear that the extra checks and Map.Entry getter method calls would outweigh any advantages. It turned out that the overall code was slightly faster.
I am sure that some people will start screaming at me, but here it is: Raw types. More specifically I used the raw form of HashSet in the code above. Since I was already using Object as its content type, I do not lose any type safety. The cost of that useless checkcast operation when calling HashSet.add() was apparently important enough to produce a 4% increase in performance when removed. Why the JVM insists on checking casts to Object is beyond me...

A:

Can't provide a replacement for your approach but a few suggestions to (slightly) optimize the existing code.

Consider initializing the hash set with a capacity (the sum of the sizes of all maps). This avoids/reduces resizing of the set during an add operation
Consider not using the keySet() as it will always create a new set in the background. Use the entrySet(), that should be much faster
Have a look at the implementations of equals() and hashCode() - if they are "expensive", then you have a negative impact on the add method.

Commodities into food.
It is not surprising that past predictions of the extent of adoption of new technology by the food and agricultural industries have only been partly realized. This is a result of the difficulty of forecasting the take-up of technology that is capable of being transferred from other industries, for example, process control methods and the advent of new packaging materials. Most technology that is adopted is normally incremental over the existing technology and forecasting of this type is best done by specific experts within the industry. Factors which influence uptake of technology in the food industry include not only the available technology, but also the supply of raw materials, economics and disposable income, food habits, health and nutrition and market requirements. In addition to these there is legislation, which imposes compositional, labelling and trade requirements on grower, processor and retailer. New products and processes are determined by all these factors, the overriding influence being the consumer's requirement for palatable and nutritious foods that provide value for money. In the cereals-processing industry significant developments have taken place in the provision of U.K. wheat varieties for breadmaking. The U.K. is now in the position where the bulk of its breadmaking wheats are homegrown. Further advances can be make by investing in applied research into those characteristics of bread wheats which are determinants of good bread flours, that in turn will help in the provision of suitable bread wheat varieties.

It has been estimated that the annual usage of library catalogue cards is on the order of 4,000,000,000. Because of this substantial volume of cards, there has been increasing pressure towards producing cards at high speed by computer printing. However, the international standard for library catalogue cards has been established in the metric system of dimensions as 7.5 centimeters by 12.5 centimeters. Such metric dimensions of the card pose problems in their computer printing on high speed printers of United States manufacture which are typically arranged to feed or space by dimensions in the English system. In other words, the card dimensions are not readily compatible to high speed printing in the United States.
Heretofore the unique size of the catalogue cards has resulted in a variety of ways to achieve the appropriate outsize through the use of forms manufactured in inches. In accordance with one method, a form has been provided in a 31/2 inch or 3 inch card depth to facilitate printing on substantially any United States high speed printer in a conventional manner. Subsequent to printing, the form is die cut in an area between the cards to force the 7.5 centimeter size. In other words, if the card depth is 3 inches, the die cut is such as to remove 0.12 centimeters of material and thereby leave a 7.5 centimeter dimension.
Another method is to use a 31/2 inch depth which may be burst into single cards subsequent to printing. Thereafter the cards are trimmed on a guillotine cutter to the correct size.
Because of the foregoing approaches to the production of catalogue cards, these cards are expensive in manufacture and expensive in use.

11/13/2015. 3 Comments. Having known Jay for many years, I have personally benefited greatly from his leadership and have watched him in action as he has led and trained countless other individuals. It's rare these days to find a man who: leads well, can equip others to lead, and does so with integrity in both his professional and private life. I highly recommend Jay!. It is been my distinct pleasure to know Jay for these past three decades. As a friend, his loyalty has been fierce. As an example, his life has been unparalleled. I am thrilled that he's taking on this challenge of growing up more leaders, and I hope the others find their time with him to be as enriching has my time has been.

At the invitation of President George W. Bush, President Daniel T.
arap Moi of Kenya and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia met at
the White House on Thursday, December 5, 2002.

The leaders reaffirmed their strong commitment in the global war on
terrorism. They recognized the significant and unique challenges of
fighting terrorism, which continues to pose a serious threat to the
region and the world. To this end, the three leaders reaffirmed their
commitment to work together and, with the international community, to
eliminate terror networks and actively oppose those governments and
organizations that support, harbor, or tolerate terrorist activities.

The leaders renewed their determination for lasting peace and
security in the region and recognized that freedom and democracy
comprise the foundation of these objectives. President Bush expressed
his appreciation for the efforts of Kenya and Ethiopia in the peace
process in Sudan and the reconciliation process in Somalia. He also
indicated his confidence in a smooth election and transition process in
Kenya, and the prompt and continuous progress in the Ethiopia-Eritrea
peace process as proscribed in the peace agreement.

The leaders called attention to the food crisis in the Horn of
Africa, particularly in Ethiopia, where food shortages are affecting
six million people and may eventually expose 14 million people to
starvation. The United States will continue to provide food aid and
other humanitarian assistance to alleviate the effects of the crisis
and calls upon other donor nations to provide substantial emergency
assistance. The leaders also agreed to take steps to prevent the
recurrence of food emergencies in the region.

The leaders welcomed African development initiatives, such as the
New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), and called upon
African countries to take advantage of opportunities provided by the
African Growth and Opportunity Act. They recognized that long-term
economic prosperity will require strong leadership at home to promote
economic freedom, coupled with support from both local and
international communities.

The leaders expressed concern over the devastating effects of the
HIV/AIDS pandemic and other infectious diseases in Africa and their
impact on social, economic, and security sectors. Kenya and Ethiopia
lauded the Bush Administration for its leadership in the global fight
against these diseases and for being the largest, single contributor to
the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. They
resolved to give high priority to the campaign to eradicate these
diseases, and the United States reaffirmed its support.

This invention relates to organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays.
Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDS) are made from luminescent organic materials that generate light when a direct current is passed through the materials. Certain characteristics of OLEDs make them appealing to those skilled in the art of electronic display technology. For example, OLEDS have a low operational voltage, a relatively high brightness, and the ability to emit different colors of light. OLED displays may be used in many applications such as displays for portable electronic devices, flat screen computer displays, or automobile stereo displays.
A typical OLED display includes an array of OLEDs formed on a glass plate or other transparent substrate. A stack of organic layers, including an electroluminescent layer, is packed between a cathode layer and an anode layer. The cathode layer and the anode layer provide the electrical power to the OLEDs in order to emit light from the diodes. The cathode layer includes a series of cathode lines, which form the pixel rows of the display, and the anode layer includes a similar series of anode lines to form the pixel columns. Solder connections have been used to electrically connect cathode and anode lines to an external drive circuit, but only through connections at the edges of the display. Typically, a pixel in the OLED flat panel display comprises a group of three OLED sub-pixels of different colors.
In prior art OLED flat panel displays, active elements, such as the cathode lines, anode lines, and diodes, are packed between a front panel and a back panel. An epoxy adhesive covering the active elements couples the front panel and back panel together. The glass material of the front panel and the epoxy material covering the OLEDs are poor thermal conductors compared to the solder connections at the edge of the display. The thermal insulation of the epoxy and glass material surrounding the all or most of the OLEDs throughout the pixel array cause a high operating temperature of the OLEDs. Also, the OLEDs further from the edges of the display have a greater level of thermal insulation than the OLEDs on the edge of the display. Thus, the operating temperatures of OLEDs vary with the OLEDs further from the edges of the display having higher temperatures.
The power consumption of an OLED integrated into a flat panel display may be enough to significantly raise the operating temperature of the diode. Higher levels of brightness in OLED flat panel displays may result in a greater level of heat generation per diode. The operational life and the efficiency of the OLED display are two significant design issues that are impacted by operating temperature. For example, the aging effects of the OLEDs are accelerated by increased operating temperature and the efficiency of the OLEDs is decreased as the operating temperature is increased. The trend in OLED display technology is for higher levels of brightness and efficiency with longer life spans.

[Cephalometric measurements of nasopharyngeal and palatal flow in cleft palate children by comparison with hearing impairment].
The comparison of the audiological results (audiometry, tympanometry 226 Hz and multifrequency tympanometry) and cephalometric measurements of the nasopharynx in cleft palate children was presented. A group of 85 children 7-15 years old, operated because of cleft lip and palate during early childhood were considered for the purpose of this study. With the results of the audiological examination, as the base, the children were divided on three subgroups: the first characterized by pathological audiogram and tympanogram, the second with normal audiograms and pathological tympanograms, the third with normal audiograms and tympanograms. On the radiological pictures (lateral tele-radiograms) the linear measurements of certain were introduced as follows: the nasopharyngeal airflow (PN) and the palatal airflow (PP). In order to obtain the radiological coefficients (PN/A) and (PP/A), the linear measurements mentioned above in relation to the adenoid size were used. The results of measurements obtained for the first and second subgroup were significant different to the relevant results in the third subgroup and controls but the best correlation obtained between audiological parameters and radiographic nasopharyngeal airway. This results prove the existence of certain relation between measured quantities and audiological examination in cleft palate children.

Also value of ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(i).Border.ColorIndex = -4105 is showing in intermediate window when the error occurs.
Please help!

A:

I'd look at the value of i when you get the error message.  Your code iterates i from to the number of series.   Say you had more series than the elements of Chtr_color, then Chrt_color(i) doesn't evaluate beyond.
Another problem might be the series index goes from 1 to N while the array index goes from 0 to N-1.

BIOGRAPHY. Anyone who views my art can see that I derive a lot of inspiration from nature and more specifically birds. I see birds as free spirits; not bound by the rules of gravity. This speaks to me in a number of ways but mostly the desire to free my mind of personal inhibitions. I let go of what logic or reason allows and let the reality of my imagination come to life. Like a bird disregarding the pull of gravity and soaring into the wind.. My most recent paintings depict color dripping from my subjects in order to represent how I literally pour myself into my artwork. I like to think that a part of me lives in each of my paintings through this transfusion of energy.

Credit: Jak Howard Blast. There have been multiple teams in the past having a six man roster on the team. But on Team Vitality it seems like the traditional way of thinking of a sixth player is thrown away. Against Complexity and BIG, the Frenchmen have changed roster between maps. Their new player Nivera has been featured twice on dust2.. - We are six players. We are not 5+1, but we are six. So depending on the map, and depending on what is the best for the team, we will change the roster, Richard "shox" Papillion told the Blast Premier Fall desk after their 2-0 victory against BIG.. - When it is going to be your time (to be replaced) you definitely want to shine like misutaaa did tonight on Overpass, the french riffler said with reference to Kévin "misutaaa" Rabier, who was top fragger on Team Vitality on Overpass.

I would be lying if I didn’t say that despite my excitement for the movie adaptation of The Hunger Games, I was a little worried about it missing the mark of the novel. So it was a relieve to hear that author, Suzanne Collins, has praised the finished project.

Collins recently wrote on the official Hunger Games Facebook page that she was “really happy” with the finished movie. She also had great things to say about Gary Ross for remaining faithful to the novel but she commented that he added a “rich and powerful vision” to the society she created.

“And, my God, the actors,” Collins added. She singled out the “extraordinary” Jennifer Lawrence, who stars as the young heroine, Katniss.

It is really great to hear that Collins enjoyed the adaptation. To many times we have remakes that anger not only the fans but also the writers. It is even worse that there is so much hype around this particular film that there is a lot of pressure to make it awesome. With the endorsement of the author it seems that this will at least do the novel justice. And I can say I will be right there on opening night to find out.

The Hunger Games is the movie adaptation of the bestselling novel by Suzanne Collins. It is followed by the sequels Catching Fire and Mockingjay.

The plot for the film is as follows:

Every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the governing body, the Capitol, of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games. A twisted punishment for a past uprising and an ongoing government intimidation tactic, The Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which “Tributes” must fight with one another until one survivor remains. Katniss Everdeen volunteers as a tribute to save her sister from going in to the ghastly arena. She is joined by Peeta Mellark, a boy she knew who once saved her life.

You can see the official cast below:

Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen

Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark

Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy

Willow Shields as Primrose “Prim” Everdeen

Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne

Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket

Lenny Kravitz as Cinna

Paula Malcomson as Mrs. Everdeen

Amandla Stenberg as Rue

Alexander Ludwig as Cato

Dayo Okeniyi as Thresh

Isabelle Fuhrman as Clove

Jacqueline Emerson as Foxface

Time for another addition to the Forest Goblin Village project! First part was the Egg-snatcher, the second was The Spider Heist and now we have the well guarded goblin hut!. The hut is from an old Warhammer starter set (featuring dwarves vs goblins) and is heavily converted to suit the need of the forest goblins! Well, some of the parts of the projects are from Night Goblins aswell, but we made a mish mash to better fit our style! Barrels from Ristul’s and forest basing kit is from Scibor. Rest of the parts are pretty much just from the Arachnarok Spider from Games Workshop, while flowers and the poison ivy are from the amazing Mini-Natur and heavily wrapped around the entire hut and ground.. I really loved painting this piece! Those archers mean business if you come too close! Still have a few more pieces to come!

Q:

Does a wallet actually verify or validate two other transactions?

This is to confirm my understanding: In many talks and posts, it is said that the wallet or client of a node validated or verifies two other transactions.
I wonder, whether this is the best terminology to describe what actually happens.
As far as my current understanding is, the wallet or client does not actually do any real verification. For example, it does not search the tangle to identify double spends.
Instead, this is done by the node during tip selection. My understanding is, that once a client asks a node to provide two tips, the node randomly selects tips and then the node uses its current in memory image of the tangle, to identify any conflicts.
Should there be none, the two tips are handed over to the wallet. The wallet does „nothing more“ than including the hashes of these two tips as branch and tail and calculating the PoW.
Is all of the above correct?
(I’d wish we’d have sequence diagrams for each of these scenarios.)

A:

You are correct.
The wallet will ask the node for 2 transactions to approve, and the node will validate that they both are consistent with each other as well as with the latest known milestone (In fact, the tip selection is designed so that at least one of the tips directly or indirectly approves the latest known milestone, so all the node has to do is check the two transactions - and possibly all their approved transactions which are not yet confirmed by the milestone - for consistency).

Small-Batch Chinese Noodles In L.A., Available Only A Few Hours A Day

Clarissa Wei is a freelance journalist who writes about food systems and minority cultures. She has researched extensively on the topics of Chinese food and sustainable agriculture and is a certified permaculture designer.

The other week I had dinner with a veteran Chinese restaurant owner and offhandedly, I asked him what his favorite Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles was. Serial diners usually struggle with this question -- but not Sam.

"Dai Ho Restaurant," he said without a moment of hesitation. "Here's the thing, they're only open from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and unlike other Chinese restaurants, the menu is very small."

"Why do you think that is?" I asked.

"Quality," he explained. "At those restaurants that have hundred of items of their menu, it's really difficult to keep the ingredients fresh. But at Dai Ho, there's only eight or so selections. The inventory is simple. Nothing goes to waste and nothing is left sitting out for too long."

Located in Temple City on Las Tunas Drive, Dai Ho (?å??, da he) Restaurant has been open for 28 years (with a previous location in Alhambra). The two Chinese characters in the restaurant name translates to "big" and "gather," respectively.

"We wanted this restaurant to be a big gathering of people," owner May Ku explained. Dai Ho is only opened 3.5 hours each day, Tuesday through Sunday, but has had enough patrons to sustain itself for nearly three decades. It's a small window of time for customers to drop in, but May and her husband Jim are at the restaurant as early as 6 a.m. for prep work.

Around town, Jim is infamously known as the "Noodle Nazi" -- a nickname earned from his snappy retorts and demands that patrons enjoy his noodles his way. May has some of the same mannerisms, but they're tempered with an extremely sweet and almost maternal way.

"Eat it immediately," she advised the moment the plate touches the table. We hover a bit to take photographs of the food but within minutes, May takes it upon herself to serve us the noodles -- mixing in the ground pork and sprinkled scallions, swirling it a bit and portioning it all into four small bowls.

May has a good reason for the rush. The noodles are best when eaten immediately or else they soak up the sauces and lose their "Q" (the Chinese equivalent of al dente) texture. Though people can often be taken aback by her hands-on approach, it's really just Chinese hospitality.

Everything at Dai Ho -- from the food to the restaurant itself -- is meticulously thought out. The floors and tables are scrubbed clean. Nothing is ever too oily. May had no hesitation letting me behind the kitchen (something many Chinese restaurant owners have qualms about); there was a massive bowl of paocai ?è? (the Chinese equivalent of kimchi) sitting over a strainer back there. "We're doing this to get rid of the excess oil," she said.

The beef shanks for the beef noodle soup are cooked for four hours and then marinated overnight before they make it onto a customer's table. The noodle dough is kneaded five times to obtain the perfect texture, boiled, and then fan-dried to cool. The strands are the ideal texture: chewy but not too gummy, firm but not at all slippery.

The noodles are made to order and leave a clean taste in your mouth -- even when drenched in a heavy peanut-based sauce.

Here's a breakdown on their top menu items.

1. Sesame Sauce Dry Noodles (Large: $8, Small: $6.50)
May's family used to own a Sichuan restaurant in Taiwan, so she's always more than willing to douse your bowl of noodles with a heap of homemade chili oil if you ask for it. The sesame sauce dry noodles, known commonly as dandan mian (æ??æ???) is served Taiwanese-style, which just means that sesame paste, rather than chili oil, is the primary ingredient.

2. Pork Bean Dry Noodles (Large: $8, Small $6.50)
The pork bean dry noodles consists of ground pork mixed with a zhajiang (é?¡é?¬) paste. Zhajiang is made with fermented soybeans. It's similar to miso paste but blindingly salty on its own.

3. Minced Meat Dry Noodles (Large: $8, Small: $6.50)
This dish is devoid of messy sauces, making it the way to go if you're looking for a clean and simple dish. The toppings: ground pork and diced scallions.

4. Beef Stew Soup Noodle ($9.00)
Beef noodle soup is a popular Taiwanese dish and the Kus do it justice. Resting in a dark, earthy broth, the beef chunks are remarkably tender, a result, undoubtedly, of hours of prep work.

5. Beef Tripe with Spicy Simmered, Dried Bean Curd and Pork Shank ($16)
At $16 for a platter, this is the restaurant's priciest dish. But you really get what you pay for. The beef tripe and bean curd come marinated in a light chili oil accompanied by braised pork shanks that have been sliced thinly and are perfect to pair with your bowl of noodles.

6. Peanut Appetizer ($6)
May likes to recommend this appetizer for diners. It's peanuts served with small silverfish, fried and lightly seasoned with salt and pepper. "We use fresh fish," May said. "This is exactly how it's done in Taipei."

Flow instability detected in ruptured versus unruptured cerebral aneurysms at the internal carotid artery.
Flow instability has emerged as a new hemodynamic metric hypothesized to have potential value in assessing the rupture risk of cerebral aneurysms. However, diverse findings have been reported in the literature. In the present study, high-resolution hemodynamic simulations were performed retrospectively on 35 aneurysms (10 ruptured & 25 unruptured) located at the internal carotid artery (ICA). Simulated hemodynamic parameters were statistically compared between the ruptured and unruptured aneurysms, with emphasis on examining the correlation of flow instability with the status of aneurysm rupture. Pronounced flow instability was detected in 20% (2 out of 10) of the ruptured aneurysms, whereas in 44% (11 out of 25) of the unruptured aneurysms. Statistically, the flow instability metric (quantified by the temporally and spatially averaged fluctuating kinetic energy over the aneurysm sac) did not differ significantly between the ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. In contrast, low wall shear stress area (LSA) and pressure loss coefficient (PLC) exhibited significant correlations with the status of aneurysm rupture. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the presence of flow instability may not correlate closely with the status of aneurysm rupture, at least for ICA aneurysms. On the other hand, the retrospective nature of the study and the small sample size may have to some extent compromised the reliability of the conclusion, and therefore large-scale prospective studies would be needed to further address the issue.

North Franklin New York Golf Courses

Blue Hill is my town course and I can play it for a reasonable rate. Non residents, like a lot of metropolitan courses, get screwed pretty much. That aside, the course is always in great shape. The fairways are in terrific shape and the greens, too. To my mind the Lakeside and the Woodlands are the better nines. The Pines has a couple good holes but is generally boring, basically straight up and down, with little intrigue to most holes. Another thing I don't care for is that Pines particularly and Lakeside somewhat, are shooting galleries--and you're the target. The fairways on many holes run alongside each other so a lot of shots come sailing over. You, of course, can do the same to others. It can be dangerous. Balls are generally easy to find, unless they drop into water. The courses are hilly in parts, but overall walking is not bad for those who prefer it. Rounds are occassionly slow, but generally it moves all right. Older folks seem to like the course, it's not a severe test of golf and several holes are not long. As a 14 handicap, I enjoy myself there, as long as I don't play it too often. You've got some challenging holes and the excellent condition of the courses is a real plus, no matter what time of year.

Old River Golf Course"It's Fun"The course is OK. I've played it about 10 times and they need to get the front 9 in. If they got the front 9 in I think it would me a lot more fun.

Emerald Lakes Golf Center"The nicest 9 hole around"Emerald Lakes is a fun little course that provides the basic golf experiance to the younger golfers in the Elk Grove area. The course has many hazards, including hole 5 which is as good as an island hole as you could get at any 9 hole course. The Course tends to be real hard in the summer and extremely wet during the winter. Give the grass at least 3 or 4 days to soak up water after a hard rain or you'll be chipping out of the mud on most holes. Overall, the course provides just enough amusement to keep the low end golfers happy, while aslo providing a great practice facility including a driving range, chipping green, and putting green. The bottom line, this is the best 9 hole course in the Elk Grove Area.---Morris, Elk Grove, CA

I am pretty sure this past weekend I was happy as a lark, feeling as though it was late-summer, as I rode my bike along beautiful sunny streets and sipped coffee at the farmer’s market. Now I am whistling Christmas tunes thinking about feasting over holiday meals as I stomp through the snow, bundled up from head to toe. The snow is here again but probably not to stay which will only add to my confusion. So as for now…welcome winter? But I will say, as much as I dreaded this dumping of snow when I first heard it was coming, I rather enjoyed my walk through to school this morning. There is something so incredibly peaceful about the snow, it is magical seeing a blanket of white as far as the eye can see covering the world that was oh so recently laden with sunshine. So, it is exciting for now, but come May I will be MORE than ready to see it go. Here we go again…now let the holiday season begin!. Advertisements

[Evaluation of the knowledge, attitude and practices of orthodontists in relation to nickel allergy during orthodontic treatment].
The aim of this study was to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of Moroccan dentists about allergy to Nickel (Ni) during orthodontic treatment. Dentists of two Moroccan cities (n = 553) were contacted and a questionnaire was distributed to those who have certified of partial or exclusive practice of orthodontics (N = 202). They were asked to specify the adverse reactions observed and the alloys frequently used. KAP about etiology, prevention and therapeutic management of allergic patients were also addressed. Twenty-two percent of the dentists have reported at least one allergic patient reaction with more implication of fixed appliances. Eleven percent of adverse effects locations reported were mucosal area and facial skin near contact area and less than 5% was systemic eruption outside contact site. Only 34% of the respondents knew the Nickel allergy etiology. Nickel-containing orthodontic alloys are generally used even in patient with suspected nickel allergy. It is very important to minimize corrosion factors and use nickel-free appliances in clinical practice.

Saudi Arabia: Boosting coast-to-coast links

Should the Gulf of Hormuz be closed to shipping, Saudi Arabia has proposed that the Kingdom’s Red Sea ports could be utilised for freight trans-shipment.

The recent rise in tension in the Gulf region is a result of Iran making a series of thinly veiled threats to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz in retaliation to a US-led tightening of sanctions against Tehran, including halting the country’s oil exports.

These threats to block the strait, which sees the passage of roughly 17m barrels of oil, some 20% of global needs and 35% of all tanker traffic, have helped keep oil prices above $100 a barrel, despite a general slowdown of the global economy. Some experts have tipped oil costs to rise to $150 a barrel or more by mid-2012, when the latest round of sanctions against Iran are set to be fully implemented.

However, while much of the focus of the media has been on the potential disruption to energy supplies, of equal concern to many states in the region is the threat to imports. The Gulf states are heavily reliant on imports to meet their staple requirements, such as food, consumer goods, raw materials for industry and other commodities, which mainly arrive by seaborne freight. Any disruption to shipping, either in or out of the Gulf, would be highly damaging to the economies of Saudi Arabia and its neighbours.

In the event that maritime trade in the Gulf is disrupted, Saudi Arabia has offered a partial solution, proposing that its string of Red Sea ports could take up at least some of the strain. In recent months, local and international media have run articles citing Saudi officials as saying preparations were being made to ready the Kingdom’s Red Sea ports for an additional flow of traffic should Gulf maritime trade be disrupted.

According to a report carried by the English-language Saudi Gazette in late January, cargo could be unloaded at Jeddah Islamic Port, Jizan Port, Yanbu Port, Dhiba or other facilities along the coast. Cargo would then be transported by land or air to their final destinations.

Though extensive, however, the road links from the Red Sea ports across Saudi Arabia to the Gulf may struggle to carry the volume of traffic needed to meet the region’s freight demands for an extended period of time, and it is unlikely that road-haulage firms would be able to find enough vehicles to handle the transport. A fully viable solution is still some way down the track, though it is moving closer to becoming a reality.

In late February, Saudi Arabia announced it was about to call for consultants to draft designs for the long-planned Landbridge rail project, which, when completed, will link the Red Sea with the Gulf, thus providing a high-speed, high-capacity, freight-moving service that would bypass the Hormuz bottleneck.

According to Mansour Al Maiman, the secretary general of the state-owned Public Investment Fund (PIF), invitations could be issued to consultants this month.

“After the appointment of the project manager, a tender will be launched targeting local contractors, who will form consortia with international companies to implement the project,” said Al Maiman, when speaking with Jeddah-based daily Okaz.

Ratified by the Council of Ministers last October, the Landbridge scheme foresees the construction of 950 km of line between Riyadh and Jeddah, a further 115 km of track linking Dammam and Jubail and the expansion of the existing line between Riyadh and Dammam. It is estimated that the line will have a capacity of around 8m shipping containers per year, with the capability of moving other cargo as well.

With a budget of around $7bn, the Landbridge will be one of the largest transport infrastructure projects undertaken in Saudi Arabia, and the one that could have the most wide-reaching effects on the local and regional economies.

The Landbridge, which is expected to be completed in the second half of the decade, will cut travel time between the two coasts and provide a secure link for trade, according to Abdul Aziz Al Hokail, the president of the Saudi Railways Organisation.

“Trains can take these goods from Jubail and Dammam ports and deliver them at the Jeddah Islamic Port, from where they can be sent on to Europe,” he said in a recent interview with the Arab News. “This will save a great deal of time and money. To give you an idea, a consignment from Dammam can reach Jeddah in 12 hours. The same journey takes more than a week by sea.”

Combined with other rail projects, such as a line running to the Jordanian border, and the GCC Railway Project – the 2000-km line that will connect Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE and Oman – the Landbridge project will boost the Kingdom’s rail transport and industrial capacity and its ability to serve as a north-south and east-west logistics corridor.

What is Major League Rugby?

MLR is the latest attempt to professionalise rugby union in the United States. The league was formed by existing clubs and business people already involved in the sport.

It is hoped that by building on existing infrastructure the competition will be able to help grow the sport in the U.S. by creating a long-term sustainable model.

As part of that plan, the league will use what it describes as "grassroots marketing efforts" to grow the game in local rugby communities.

How many teams will compete?

For its inaugural season MLR consists of seven teams -- Austin Elite Rugby, Glendale Raptors, Houston SaberCats, NOLA Gold, San Diego Legion, Seattle Seawolves and the Utah Warriors.

Plans are already in place to expand the league, with Rugby United New York (RUNY) confirmed to join MLR in 2019. RUNY have already competed in exhibition matches this year to give fans a taste of what to expect when the club becomes a full member of the competition.

The new team should be joined by at least one more new club next year, too, with the Dallas Griffins -- whose coaching panel includes former Bath boss Mike Ford -- and the Ontario Arrows both pushing for inclusion.

How will the champions be crowned?

MLR opening weekend fixtures Saturday, April 21

NOLA Gold @ Houston SaberCats, 3 p.m. ET / 8 p.m. BST

Austin Elite Rugby @ Glendale Raptors, 5 p.m. ET / 10 p.m. BST Sunday, April 22

San Diego Legion @ Seattle Seawolves, 8 p.m. ET / 1 a.m. BST (+1)

The seven teams will battle it out over a 10-week regular season before a semifinal stage is held on Saturday, June 30.

Seven days later the inaugural MLR Championship game will be played, with the winner taking home the first ever title.

Players you should look out for

Takudzwa Ngwenya is the undoubted star of this year's MLR. The former Biarritz and Brive wing, who shot to fame at the 2007 Rugby World Cup, will line up for San Diego Legion.

Ngwenya has been joined in Southern California by fellow U.S. internationals Nate Augspurger -- who captained the Eagles to Americas Rugby Championship victory earlier this year -- Mike Te'o and Cam Dolan.

Houston's hopes will rest rather firmly on the shoulders of Olympic gold medal-winning Fiji centre Osea Kolinisau, who has enjoyed a glittering Sevens career.

Tongan international Fetuʻu Vainikolo, meanwhile, will play for the Utah Warriors alongside former NFL player and U.S. international Paul Lasike.

About your Compaq Presario CQ Series

What type of memory do I need?Your Compaq Presario CQ Series uses PC2-5300, PC2-6400 type memory.

What is the maximum amount of memory that I can add?Your Compaq Presario CQ Series can support up to 4096MB (4GB) of computer memory. For optimal performance install the maximum amount of memory in each socket.

How much memory does my system have now?Your system comes standard with 2048MB (2GB) of RAM. If you have upgraded your system then you may have a different amount.

What are banks and sockets?A bank is a group of memory sockets. A socket is where a memory module is inserted. A bank can have one or more sockets.

One or more of the sockets in your system is already filled with memory. When you upgrade your system, you can either add memory to one of the open sockets and/or remove memory from a filled socket and replace it with a higher capacity memory module.

How many banks and sockets does my Compaq Presario CQ Series have?Your Compaq Presario CQ Series CQ56-103TU (XV401PA) has 2 banks of 2 sockets each for a total of 2 memory sockets.

Is there anything else I should consider prior to upgrading my Compaq Presario CQ Series memory?- Although the BIOS will address 4096MB (4GB) of memory, the amount available to the system will be less than 4096MB (4GB) depending on computer resources.- Modules must be purchased and installed in pairs for dual channel performance.- System is capable of recognizing 4GB of memory. However, due to the 32-bit limitation of MS Windows/Mac OS, Operating System can only utilize 3.25GB of the memory when 2GB + 2GB are installed. Therefore we recommend the configuration of 2GB + 1GB = 3GB for this system. 64-bit windows would not have this limitation.

FAQ

General questions about upgrading memory

What is memory?Memory or RAM is a piece of hardware in your Compaq Presario CQ Series CQ56-103TU (XV401PA) that holds software applications that you are working on. It serves as temporary working space between your computer's hard drive and CPU.

How does additional memory improve performance?One task that additional memory speeds up is opening a new software application. Let's take this as an example. When you open a new application on your Compaq Presario CQ Series CQ56-103TU (XV401PA), your computer's CPU fetches the application from the hard drive and stores it in RAM memory. It stores it in RAM because RAM is very fast relative to the hard drive. When RAM gets full, and you open a new application then the CPU needs to kick out one of your open applications, put it back on the slow hard drive, fetch the new application from the hard drive, and place the new application in RAM. Basically, it swaps the applications.This game of swapping wastes time. Ideally, your computer could have an infinite amount of RAM. Then your CPU would fetch an application once from the hard drive, save it into RAM, and never need to kick out another application. There is no such thing as infinite RAM, but you can max out the RAM on your computer by adding the maximum amount of memory to each socket.

How do I max out the memory on my system?The maximum RAM your Compaq Presario CQ Series CQ56-103TU (XV401PA) can support is 4096MB (4GB), and your system has 2 sockets.To max out your RAM memory, add the maximum amount of memory to each memory socket.To find out how much RAM each socket can support, divide the system maximum RAM amount by the total number of sockets in your system. For example, if your system maximum RAM is 2GB, and your system has 2 total sockets then the maximum amount each socket can support is 1GB. If one of the sockets is already filled then you can always remove the existing module and replace it with a higher capacity module.

Will adding memory void my warranty?No. The 1975 Magnusson-Moss Act prevents OEM manufacturers from disqualifying a warranty when 3rd party memory is used. For more details, please see the Magnuson-Moss Act.

What is memory speed?Memory speed refers to the amount of time that memory (RAM) takes to put data into its memory or send it out. Your device's memory will have an upper limit on the speed at which it can operate.

What is a memory kit?A memory kit is a number of memory modules sold as a unit or a kit. For example, a 1GB memory kit will contain two 512MB modules. This is written as (2x512MB).

What is the difference between RAM & Hard Drive Memory?RAM and hard drive disk space are both referred to as memory which can be confusing. RAM is a series of memory sticks in your computer that temporarily holds software applications and documents that you are working on, prior to saving it. Once saved, the documents or software applications are saved permanently on your hard drive. If you are running low on disk space on your hard drive you can consider purchasing a portable hard drive or flash drives to store your files on.

Developing a Safe Way. (From left) Jonathan Pena, Brian Hernandez and Joel Yahutentzi are helping the homeless. Photo: Sylmar (Calif.) Biotech Health Academy. Used with permission.. Engineering club students at Sylmar (Calif.) Biotech Health Academy developed an idea for an identification card to be used by homeless people. Featuring a user photo and a scannable datamatrix code, the cards would help outreach workers and others track homeless individuals to better target resources. The code would connect users to a database. In addition, a social-media-style website would allow the community to learn how the homeless are being helped and to share ideas and resources. Job training would be emphasized. They call the system Safe-Way. See news coverage:.

As Portlanders well know, on the first Friday evening of every month downtown Congress Street turns into one big art gallery/party. Since Joe is a bit of a local artist himself (ask him sometime about his photography from the '60s and '70s, and be prepared to listen for a while), promoting First Friday seems like a no-brainer. Joe thanks all the local artists who make this night a great one every month, thanks the organizers, Creative Portland, and thanks the Portlanders who come out and celebrate. Walk on, Portland..

The California teacher pension system faces a $19.6 billion funding gap during the next three decades, despite three years of strong investment returns, according to a new report. That means teachers, school districts and the state will need to boost contributions to the nation’s second-largest public pension system, the actuarial consulting firm Milliman reported.. The funding gap is narrowing for the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and the nearly 800,000 teachers it covers, the report said. The long-term deficit was projected at $24.2 billion as recently as 2004, but double-digit investment gains reduced the expected shortfall. With $168 billion in assets, CalSTRS can cover 87 percent of its pension obligations, up from 82 percent in 2003, the firm said. That is nearly at the current average of 88 percent coverage for 125 state retirement systems surveyed this year by Wilshire Consulting.. Link to MontereyHerald.com

Revolution Wheels. wold racing- where are you located, I have a nice set of 4. Interested in what you find. Please let me know. Thanks. Great wheel, looks good on Minis. Back when I raced on slicks I tried to have at least one spare of everything. I know I have at least one spare set (4) of NOS Revolutions up on the loft, never been mounted. Not sure if I have 2 sets. There are piles of wheels up there from my days of oooohhhh I need that I should buy it and then I just packed it away, now I cant even remember what is buried up there. Wont be back there until next weekend, will look and let you know. If I have 2 spare sets then I would sell one, if I only have one...probably not. BTW, the race Revolutions were lighter than the street version. In the 10" wheel, the race version is not a lot lighter, maybe a pound.. looking, selling, trading...?.

While the total number of cars on the road will increase in the coming years, experts predict that the United States’ oil usage will peak next year. That’s because the growing popularity of electric and hybrid vehicles along with ever-increasing (government-mandated, at least for now) fuel economy standards mean that the our gasoline usage will peak next year, and fall from there.

Americans are still opting for larger cars than they might if they remembered that gas prices will probably go back up. However, Reuters reports that consultants at WoodMackenzie in Scotland figured out that we can expect to use less gas starting next year.

“We expect gasoline engine efficiency to continue to improve through better deployment of batteries in hybrid vehicles,” an expert at WoodMackenzie explained. As batteries and ranges improve on plug-in hybrid vehicles, they’ll replace some gas-powered and gas-electric hybrid vehicles.

Globally, petroleum usage will reach its peak later. As more people in the developing world get their own cars, demand for fuel is expected to peak by 2028, or even the 2030s, depending on which expert you ask.

Petroleum is still used to produce plastic, which is still in demand, and to power mass transit vehicles like buses, so there are more factors involved than individual drivers and their needs.

Yes, it was produced not so long ago. It raises the level of estrogen in blood and releases from sexual anesthesia..

The University Community Next Generation Innovation Project (Gig.U) and Gigabit Squared this week announced funding of $200 million for the nation’s first multi-community broadband gigabit deployment project. The funding will support projects for up to six select Gig.U members, which will offer broadband networks with speeds between 100 and 1,000 times faster than today’s standards. “What makes the Gigabit Squared approach so exciting is that it goes far beyond normal industry business models in how to successfully and creatively improve broadband access speeds for university communities, which is exactly the premise upon which Gig.U was founded,” said Blair Levin, Executive Director of Gig.U. “We intuitively knew this, but to see Gigabit Squared emerge so strongly today proves that yes, America needs an upgrade; and that yes, there are innovators and investors willing to step up to get it done.” Gig. U and Gigabit Squared will make their selections between November 2012 and March 2013. The joint press release follows below.

Gigabit Squared and Gig.U to Make Available $200 Million in Broadband Development Funding Through the Gigabit Neighborhood Gateway Program

Digital Economic Development Initiatives is Nation’s First Multi-Community Gigabit Deployment

(May 23, 2012) Washington, DC – In a joint announcement today, The University Community Next Generation Innovation Project (Gig.U) and Gigabit Squared announced the nation’s first multi-community broadband gigabit deployment with the availability of $200 million in funding. Under the Gigabit Neighborhood Gateway Program, capital is available to support up to six select Gig.U member-sponsored projects. At the center of the Gigabit Neighborhood Gateway Program is the idea that communities and their local stakeholders can drive economic opportunities through private investments that leverage public capital that will accelerate the deployment and utilization of gigabit speed networks.

Gigabit Squared created the Gigabit Neighborhood Gateway Program to help select Gig.U communities build and test gigabit speed broadband networks with speeds from 100 to 1000 times faster than what Americans have today. The Gigabit Neighborhood Gateway Program will offer communities services at a competitive price for innovative projects that range from small neighborhoods of 5,000 to 10,000 and up to 100,000 people. Selections will be announced between November 2012 and March 2013.

We have brought together a team that has had a hand in transforming broadband in dozens of communities, Including Cleveland-Ohio, Chattanooga-Tennessee, Lafayette-Louisiana, Jackson-Mississippi, Topeka-Kansas, and the Virgin Islands. Including companies such as Corning, G4S, Juniper Networks, Alcatel Lucent, Calix, Ericson, Level 3, Genexis, OnDemand, Baller Herbst and others.

Aaron Gadouas, Senior Vice President of the investment firm Stern Brothers & Co., commented on the unique model Gigabit Squared has created, “Gigabit Neighborhood Gateway Program is a compelling public/private model because both sides are able to leverage the contributions of the other, enabling projects that would not have been completed otherwise. It is a well-conceived and innovative initiative.”

“What makes the Gigabit Squared approach so exciting is that it goes far beyond normal industry business models in how to successfully and creatively improve broadband access speeds for university communities, which is exactly the premise upon which Gig.U was founded,” said Blair Levin, Executive Director of Gig.U. ”We intuitively knew this, but to see Gigabit Squared emerge so strongly today proves that yes, America needs an upgrade; and that yes, there are innovators and investors willing to step up to get it done.”

The Gigabit Neighborhood Gateway Program will create demonstration projects in Gig.U communities that will serve as a model for maximizing the impacts of regional broadband networks. Each will feature “open” architecture networks to create long-term value and growth for the Gig.U University and community partners.

Each Gigabit Neighborhood Gateway Program project will feature:

The use of underutilized network assets and capacity and local investment to drive services and unlock long-term value and sustainability,

A framework to create new capacity and spur development, including community service applications that promote better health, education and community services,

Previously unavailable speed and bandwidth,

Digital economic development strategies to aggregate revenues and lower the overall costs of scaling gigabit-broadband, and

A future-state network that will serve as a platform for innovation, next generation application development, workforce development and job creation.

“The Stimulus Funding was a great jumpstart to get broadband initiatives on track in the U.S. But it is just a starting point,” explains Mark Ansboury, president of Gigabit Squared. “In order to realize true economic revitalization, we’re urging our national and community leaders to think and act in more creative ways. And we’re backing those efforts with significant investment of our own.”

“As a founding member of Gig.U, Case Western Reserve University is proud to be piloting the next generation of broadband networks to neighborhoods around universities, and providing high bandwidth service to support the national priorities of health and wellness, home energy management, public safety, and STEM education at the high school level,” said Dr. Lev Gonick, Case Western Reserve’s Vice President, Information Technology Services & Chief Information Officer. “Working with Gigabit Squared, Cleveland’s Judson Manor and leading technology companies, we’ll be creating a second gigabit fiber to the premise research project that will serve as a model for other Gig.U communities.”

Comparison of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase isoforms from rat heart and bovine aorta. Separation and inhibition by selective reference phosphodiesterase inhibitors.
The resolution as well as the biochemical properties of the multiple molecular forms of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, in a given tissue, may be strongly dependent upon experimental conditions of preparation (extraction of crude enzyme from tissues and fractionation procedures). In the present study, we compare the different molecular forms of cardiac (rat heart ventricle) and vascular (bovine aorta) phosphodiesterase isolated from crude extracts prepared either in sucrose medium or in hypotonic medium (in the presence of protease inhibitors and ion chelators) using two different fractionation procedures: isoelectric focusing on flat gel bed and DEAE-Trisacryl anion exchange chromatography. Both the calmodulin-dependent and the cAMP-specific forms exhibited close IEF and chromatographic patterns and showed similar sensitivities towards reference inhibitors regardless of the tissue of origin. In marked contrast, the cGMP-specific isoform notably differed from one to another tissue with respect to its biochemical properties (only the cardiac tissue being capable of stimulation by cGMP) and sensitivities to xenobiotics. Thus the possibility exists that pharmacological agents may modulate phosphodiesterase activity differently in cardiac and vascular target tissues.

While the summer of 2011 may be the summer of comic book movies, with the like of Green Lantern, Thor, and First Avenger: Captain America all debuting in theaters, it looks like 2012 will be the summer of sequels, with sequels to Star Trek and Wolverine likely dominating the box office.. ComingSoon reports that Paramount has tentatively scheduled the unofficially titled Star Trek 2 to debut on June 29, 2012, making it the lone movie scheduled in that month so far. But backstage at the recent People's Choice Awards, Hugh Jackman talked about his schedule, saying that he would spend this summer working on the Shawn Levy-directed Real Steel before revealing plans for Wolverine 2.. Wolverine's going to be back. He's going to Japan. We shoot that probably in a year, year-and-a-half, something like that.. Should Wolverine 2 keep to that schedule, Fox will likely push for a summer 2012 release.

Not really sure what happened, but we took Windsward and started figuring out what we wanted to upgrade. We changed the project 3 times at first until we chose to finish tier 3 workshop, but now Windward has multiple tier 3 stations on the first day of ownership. Don’t know how we did it because there are more stations than what we changed from as tier 3.

Q:

Where to set environment variables such that they can be read from `config/initializer/*.rb`?

I have all my environment variables in config/initializers/app_environment_variables.rb and this setup has been working so far, except now I need to use the variables in config/environments.rb and config/environments/*.rb, which seem to be executed before config/initializer/*.rb.
I found this page showing "the configuration order" as the following,

config/preinitializer.rb
config/environment.rb
config/environments/#{RAILS_ENV}.rb
plugin initialization
gem initialization
config/initializer/*.rb
...

but that info is from 2009, whereas I am on Rails 3.1. I expected to see this kind of info in the "initialization" or the "configuring" guides, but either I was unable to find the info, or it's not there.

A:

I added puts "--- #{__FILE__}" to the top of each of the following files in a new "demo" app (rails new demo):
config.ru
config/application.rb
config/boot.rb
config/environment.rb
config/environments/development.rb
config/initializers/hello.rb

Then I simply started the app with rails server, and got the following output (.... for terseness):
--- /Volumes/..../initialization-order/demo/config/boot.rb
--- /Volumes/..../initialization-order/demo/config/application.rb
=> Booting WEBrick
=> Rails 3.2.13 application starting in development on http://0.0.0.0:3000
=> Call with -d to detach
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server
--- /Volumes/..../initialization-order/demo/config.ru
--- /Volumes/..../initialization-order/demo/config/environment.rb
--- /Volumes/..../initialization-order/demo/config/environments/development.rb
--- /Volumes/..../initialization-order/demo/config/initializers/hello.rb
[2013-05-16 15:05:59] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2013-05-16 15:05:59] INFO  ruby 1.9.3 (2013-02-22) [x86_64-darwin12.3.0]
[2013-05-16 15:05:59] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=91029 port=3000
^C[2013-05-16 15:06:25] INFO  going to shutdown ...
[2013-05-16 15:06:25] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start done.
Exiting

Therefore the initialization order is as follows:
/config/boot.rb
/config/application.rb
/config.ru
/config/environment.rb
/config/environments/development.rb
/config/initializers/hello.rb

So if you want your environment variables loaded before config/environments/*.rb (and before /config/initializers/*.rb) then read this next.



NMR studies of L-dopa melanin-manganese(II) complex in water solution.
The study of water relaxation rates of solutions of melanins with paramagnetic metal ions provides a powerful tool for investigating the binding sites and for obtaining useful structural and dynamic information. The measure of 1H- and 2H-longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates at a single, high-magnetic field for H2O/D2O (80:20) solutions allows the determination of tau c, tau R, tau e, tau M, r, q, and Z (the outer sphere contribution to the overall relaxation rate) for Mn(II)-L-Dopa melanin system.

Factors predisposing, enabling and reinforcing routine screening of patients for preventing fetal alcohol syndrome: a survey of New Jersey physicians.
A survey of New Jersey physicians showed that they do not routinely ask their pregnant patients about alcohol consumption for a wide variety of reasons including physician bias due to their own abuse, lack of training for the task, poor awareness of the problem and its effects, denial that FAS occurs in private practice, time limitations, disinterest, fear of offending the patient and belief that patients will not tell the truth about their alcohol use. Findings suggest that physicians need to deal with conflicting attitudes about their own drinking behavior as well as that of their patients. Organized physician support is needed to develop skills for detection and referral of alcohol abusing patients at risk of negative fetal outcomes.

Q:

What is meant by "equating the coefficients of 1, x, and $x^2$ gives a set of linear equations?

The textbook I am reading shows an example problem:
Problem:
Show that {$1 + x, 3x + x^2, 2 + x - x^2$} is independent in $P_2$.  Where $P_2$ is the set of all polynomials.  
Solution:
Suppose a linear combination of these polynomials vanishes.
$$s_1(1 + x) + s_2(3x + x^2) + s_3(2 + x - x^2) = 0$$
Equating the coefficients of 1, x, and $x^2$ gives a set of linear equations.
$$s_1 + \space \space  + 2s_3 = 0$$
$$s_1 + 3s_2 +  \space s_3 = 0$$
$$\space s_2 - \space s_3 = 0$$
The only solution is $s_1 = s_2 = s_3 = 0$.  
My question is what is meant by "Equating the coefficients of 1, x, and $x^2$ gives a set of linear equations." i.e. what exactly is done in this step to obtain the three equalities after?

A:

Starting from the equation:
$$s_1(1+x)+s_2(3x+x^2)+s_3(2+x-x^2)=0$$
This can be rewritten as:
$$(s_1+2s_3)x^0+(s_1+3s_2+s_3)x^1+(s_2-s_3)x^2=0$$
The RHS is zero but can also be written as:
$$(s_1+2s_3)x^0+(s_1+3s_2+s_3)x^1+(s_2-s_3)x^2=0*x^0+0*x^1+0*x^2$$.
These two expressions can only be equal to each other if each power has the same coefficient is equivalent. But that means that the coefficient in from of $x^0$ on the left and right hand side equate ($s_1+2s_3=0$), as well as the coefficient in front of $x^1$ (s_1+3s_2+s_3=0), and of course the coefficient in front of $x^2$ (s_2-s_3=0).
This gives the system of equations:
$$s_1+2s_3=0$$
$$s_1+3s_2+s_3=0$$
$$s_2-s_3=0$$
If the only solution is $s_1,s_2,s_3=0$ then the basis (originally polynomials in this case) is independent.

The present invention relates to an article made of plastic material, which article at least partly includes a laminate which comprises a layer of expanded plastic material, and the process for manufacturing such an article.
Articles made of plastic material with a heat insulating ability have been commonly known for a long time. One example of such an article are containers made of expanded thermoplastic styrene, so-called styro-foam containers. These containers are excellent as heat insulators but have a very poor mechanical stability which will give them the characteristics of a disposable package. The surface of these containers is furthermore porous, which will make them rather difficult to keep clean. They are therefore less suited for use in the food supply industry.
Another type of articles made of plastic material is the rotation moulded plastic pallet. Initially a skin of solid thermoplastic material such as polyethylene or polypropylene is manufactured. The skin is after cooling filled with an expanded thermosetting polymer, most often polyurethane. Surf boards are also manufactured by this procedure. The reason for the use of expanded polymer is not the insulating effect in these cases, but the stabilising effect that will be obtained.
Yet another type of articles made of plastic material, are manufactured by blow moulding. These can be made twin-walled with an intermediate hollow space. Compost receptacles can be mentioned as an example of such articles. The hollow space can be filled with an expanded polymer if an increased heat insulating ability is desired. Normally a thermosetting material of polyurethane will be used.

The present invention generally relates to catalytic converters for reducing the level of pollutants and, more specifically, to a catalytic converter for destroying ozone.
Environmental control systems for aircraft supply pressurized and conditioned air to the aircraft cabin. The temperature, pressure, and relative humidity must be controlled to provide for the comfort of flight crew and passengers within the aircraft. Typically, environmental control systems receive compressed air, such as bleed air from a compressor stage of an aircraft gas turbine engine, expand the compressed air in a cooling turbine, and remove moisture from the compressed air through a water extractor.
Toxic ozone in the compressed air can become an issue when aircraft cruise at altitudes that exceed 20,000 feet. Modern jet aircraft are typically designed for fuel-efficient operation at relatively high altitudes of 25,000 feet or more above sea level. At these altitudes, the ozone content in ambient air is relatively high and, thus, the air supplied to the aircraft environmental control system can contain a substantial amount of ozone. Air containing ozone can cause lung and eye irritation, headaches, fatigue, and breathing discomfort. Because of these dangers, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires that ozone levels in airplane cabin air be maintained below specified limits.
It is known within the art to utilize catalytic converters to reduce or eliminate ozone in the air supplied to the aircraft cabin. There are a number of desirable characteristics for an ozone destroying catalytic converter of an aircraft. These characteristics include a) high efficiency of ozone conversion at bleed air operating temperature; b) good poison resistance from humidity, sulfur compounds, oil, dust, and the like, which may be present in the compressed air (for long life and minimum system overhaul and maintenance costs); c) light weight to minimize system parasitic load; d) high structural integrity of catalyst support under extreme heat or vibration shock, which may arise during normal flight conditions (also for long life and minimum system overhaul and maintenance costs); and e) high mass transport efficiency with low pressure drop.
Known within the art are ceramic monolith supports which carry a catalyst on a washcoat applied to their surfaces. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,405,507 discloses aluminum honeycomb treated with NaOH. U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,822 discloses catalysts attached by an elastic organic adhesive to a metal foil support. U.S. Pat. No. 6,203,771 discloses a catalytic converter with active metals supported directly on an anodized surface layer to remove ozone. However, none disclose the use of the washcoat to destroy ozone.
In some aircraft, the pressurized air supplied to the cockpit and passenger cabins is supplied by dedicated compressors. The air may contain the same amount of ozone as bleed air, but the temperature of this air may be lower than bleed air. At lower temperatures, the ozone removal efficiency of conventional catalytic converters decreases with time. Several formulations have successfully addressed this issue using precious metals and multiple preparation steps. However, this makes producing the catalytic converters expensive.
Moreover, the catalytic converters of the prior art do not utilize the washcoat to destroy ozone. It would be desirable to provide a system and method that uses the support (washcoat) to destroy ozone, rather than merely providing surface area support for a catalyst.
As can be seen, there is a need for an inexpensive catalyst for catalytic converters that destroy ozone. It would also be desirable for such a catalyst to have a low-temperature ozone removal efficiency that has a minimum decay over time, may be easily integrated with existing airplane bleed air systems, has low weight and low pressure drop, and reduces impact on existing environmental control systems and the plane's fuel consumption.

Republican Senate leaders have promised a vote on defunding Planned Parenthood before lawmakers depart for their month-long summer recess, according to Sen. Rand Paul.. The Kentucky Republican and presidential candidate will announce at an anti-Planned Parenthood rally Tuesday a "commitment from Senate leadership for a vote on his legislation to defund Planned Parenthood prior to the August recess," according to a statement from his campaign.. Paul introduced one-page legislation last week that would prohibit any federal funding from going to Planned Parenthood, which would include Medicaid dollars and Title 10 family planning funds.. The House is scheduled to depart for August recess on Wednesday, while the Senate is expected to start its recess later in the week. The office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hasn't said what day the defunding vote would take place.Read more on WashingtonExaminer.com

By now, Noble Energy (NYSE: NBL ) and its partners in the natural gas fields off the coast realize they need one thing over anything else: a partner with liquefied natural gas experience. That is what makes the potential deal with Australian company Woodside Petroleum so important. Not only is it an experienced LNG operator in Australia, it also doesn't have any major connections to other Middle East countries that could pose a potential conflict of interest. Problem is, though, the deal to bring Woodside into the fold is taking longer than expected.. Unfortunately for Noble and others, they aren't negotiating from a position of strength: They need Woodside more than Woodside needs this project. For Noble Energy, getting this deal done has major ramifications on its growth over the next several years. Find out how it could impact Noble's production plans by tuning into the video below..

Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film

The Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures is one of the annual Directors Guild of America Awards given by the Directors Guild of America. With 3 wins out of 11 nominations, Steven Spielberg is both the most awarded and most nominated director for this category in the history of DGA. Additionally, Alejandro G. Iñárritu is the only director to win consecutive awards. He was awarded in 2015 and 2016 for his directorial work in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) and The Revenant, respectively.

Predicting Oscar’s Outcome
The Directors Guild of America Award for Feature Film has traditionally been a very good barometer for both Best Director and Best Picture Academy Awards.

Only eight times since the DGA Award's inception has the DGA Award winner not won the Academy Award; in 1968 (Carol Reed won the Oscar for directing Oliver!); 1972 (Bob Fosse won the Oscar for directing Cabaret); 1985 (Sydney Pollack won the Oscar for directing Out of Africa, as Steven Spielberg was not nominated for directing The Color Purple); 1995 (Mel Gibson won for directing Braveheart, as Ron Howard was not nominated for directing Apollo 13); 2000 (Steven Soderbergh won the Oscar for directing Traffic); 2002 (Roman Polanski won the Oscar for directing The Pianist); 2012 (Ang Lee won the Oscar for directing Life of Pi as Ben Affleck was not nominated for directing Argo; and 2019 (Bong Joon-ho won the Oscar for directing Parasite). This does not count 1948–49, when the DGA used a non-calendar award year (unlike the Academy Awards); both 1948 and 1949 DGA winners competed for the 1949 Academy Award for Best Director, which went to the 1948 DGA winner (Joseph L. Mankiewicz for A Letter to Three Wives).

Conversely, eighteen times has the representing film directed by the DGA winner not gone on to win Best Picture, as recently as 2019 (for 1917).

Since the chief of the arm forces spoke on a political issue, I feel obliged to write something about this. Two bloggers have also written on this new development. I have written about this in my earlier blog( see the 3rd way- no thank you).

It is highly irregular for a sitting general to speak about politics. The traditional role of the army is apolitical.

But I am sure, in keeping with the characteristic wanton abandon of the PakLah-Najib leadership, this statement will not be broached. It may even increase public’s anxiety which can be exploited by the sitting government.

Creating a military toned government is a double edged sword. It can be used by the ruling elite to maintain their political power. Once installed, the military led government is more effective hurdle to democracy. It will involve concessions given to the military the refusal of which can even lead to outright military coup d’état.

I chance upon a short speech by Lee Kuan Yew who said something along these lines. From the moment the commander has pressed the button, control of events goes over to local commanders until the battle was over. During the battle, it is the captain, the lieutenant, the sergeant, the corporal, the lance corporal and private, who makes the decisions. Now, that is a sobering thought indeed.

Those who venture to think that military rule is good need only to study the fate that have befallen countries that have embraced military rule. Invariably these have turned into dictatorships and the military establishments becomes the oppressor.

In a society like ours, the means of organised and structured violence are in the monopoly of the military. If the ruling elite allowsa strong military activism, they have to live with the political hazard that this choice causes. The military can be an agent serving the elite’s interest or can be the enemy they slept with. Then the ruling elite must be conscious of the costs involved such as the need to pay efficiency wages to soldiers and make other social and policy concessions. To avoid coups.

But beyond just exploring the notion of the usefulness of using the military as bulwark to democracy or to life as they know it, the current political leadership has exposed its truer darkener side.

If you thought the US$1 million prize for DotA 2′s début tournament was over the moon, wait till you hear what Riot Games has planned for its own League of Legends: they’ve just announced a US$5 million prize pool for the League of Legends Season Two Championship.. Unlike Valve, who is spending all of that US$1 million on a single event, Riot Games is splitting up the prize money to fund local, national and international tournaments. Presumably, that means we’ll see at least some of that money channeled to Singapore through our local LoL publisher, Garena.. Still, who are we kidding? That’s FIVE. MILLION. DOLLARS. So where’s the poor, underperforming global economy everyone’s been talking about?. - Related Items. - League of Legends. Have your say. Add your comments:

*WINNER – 2016 Canberra Critic’s Circle Prize for Literature. This first book of poetry by Niloofar Fanaiyan is about transit as both a physical and conceptual suspension of time and space. It touches on the intersections of people, place, culture and history experienced by travellers: the feeling of being stuck on the periphery while life continues elsewhere; and the possibilities inherent in every journey.. ‘Fanaiyan’s poetry is scattered with jewel bright images – ethereal and sumptuous but also prosaic and authentic.’ – Anita Patel.

During this two-day event, GWEC is organising its first closed-door Offshore Roundtable in Vietnam, hoping to start some early conversations to facilitate the development of this emerging offshore industry. This half-day roundtable will be a key platform to enable interactions amongst government authorities, offshore industry stakeholders, international and local finance institutions, and is open to GWEC members and any company with strong interest in offshore. Urgent issues such as offshore planning and permitting process, long-term investment, offshore costs and development of local infrastructures will also be addressed.

Human virus and bacteriophage inactivation in clear water by simulated sunlight compared to bacteriophage inactivation at a southern California beach.
Few quantitative data exist on human virus inactivation by sunlight and the relationship between human and indicator viruses under sunlit conditions. We investigated the effects of sunlight on human viruses (adenovirus type 2, poliovirus type 3) and bacteriophages (MS2, Q-Beta SP, Fi, M13, PRD1, Phi-X174, and coliphages isolated from Avalon Bay, California). Viruses were inoculated into phosphate buffered saline or seawater, exposed to a laboratory solar simulator for ≤12 h, and enumerated by double agar layer or cell culture to derive first-order inactivation rate constants (k(obs), h(-1)). The viruses most resistant to sunlight were adenovirus type 2 (k(obs)= 0.59 ± 0.04 h(-1)) and bacteriophage MS2 (k(obs)= 0.43 ± 0.02 h(-1)), which suggests MS2 may be a conservative indicator for sunlight resistant human viruses in clear water when sunlight inactivation is the main removal mechanism. Reasonable agreement was observed between somatic coliphage inactivation rates measured in the solar simulator (k(mean) = 1.81 h(-1)) and somatic coliphages measured in the surf zone during a field campaign at Avalon Bay during similar sunlight intensity (k = 0.75 h(-1) at log-RMSE minimum; k(range) = 0.54 h(-1) to >1.88 h(-1); Boehm, A. B. et al. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2009, 43, (21), 8046-8052). Hence, measuring sunlight inactivation rates of viruses in the laboratory can be used to estimate inactivation in the environment under similar sunlight and water quality conditions.

Change

[A187/B230] In the First Analogy Kant argues that "alteration can be perceived only in substances", meaning that we can only understand alteration as the change of states of an eternal substance. He argues that such substances "are the substrata of all determinations of time" if we did not relate successive appearances to (spatial) substances, we would be unable to make any temporal judgment; Kant concludes "permanence is thus a necessary condition under which alone appearances are determinable as things or objects in a possible experience".

As wedding photographers, we live for candid moments like this one at Monarch Beach Resort's Club 19. From the best man's priceless expression it's easy to tell he's got a flair for comedic storytelling, not to mention that he is positively cracking up the bride and groom. It's priceless to have a shot where all three people's personalities shine through so authentically, and we were so happy to be able to capture this moment with all their distinct reactions on display.. When possible, we suggest to the band leader or DJ to let the toast givers, especially the Best Man, Maid of Honor and parents, to stand near the couple with a cordless mic so that there is a closer connection with the Bride and Groom; as opposed to giving the toast from the bandstand or the DJ location..

As well as performing successful islet cell transplants, our clinicians and scientists at SVI and SVHM are also working on ways to make the procedure safer and more effective. For example, we are part of a new Consortium effort developing novel tolerance protocols for islet transplantation using new reagents and drugs (funded by a JDRF Clinical Research Network). The clinical Transplant Program also provides a valuable opportunity for clinical research on human islets obtained but insufficient or not suitable for transplant. In the future, this program will provide a platform for future innovations in beta-cell replacement for type 1 diabetes, e.g. pig islet cells and encapsulation of islet cells.

 -- Prince William and Princess Kate touched down in Paris today and kicked off a two-day charm offensive ahead of Brexit. The couple met with French President Francois Hollande inside the Elysee Palace and attended a black-tie reception and dinner at the British Embassy.

William, 34, reassured the French in his speech at the British Embassy that the partnership remains between Great Britain and France.

"This partnership will continue despite the United Kingdom's recent decision to leave the European Union," William said.

William and Kate, 35, will be front and center in Paris at a series of events to honor and celebrate the French for their resilience in the wake of the Paris and Nice terrorist attacks and to celebrate French arts and culture. The royal couple's visit to Paris has enormous political significance in the wake of the U.K.'s Brexit decision to withdraw from the European Union.

"I have been reminded over the last few years, as Catherine and I have attended commemorations of the two World Wars, how much we have experienced together and have stood together in moments of great crisis," William said today. "Our relationship is just as strong and enduring today. Our hearts went out to the people of France when you responded so bravely to the awful terrorist attacks of the last two years."

The royal family has scheduled a series of visits to European countries in the months ahead -- including William's and Kate's July visit to Germany and Poland -- to remind Great Britain's European neighbors that they are still allies and partners after last summer's Brexit vote.

"Before I came here, Her Majesty The Queen reminded me of how much she has enjoyed her many visits to France," William told the gathered dignitaries and guests. "It is a feeling that Catherine and I entirely share, and look forward to this and many more visits in the years to come – to France our ally, our friend, our neighbor."

Kate wore a black, tea-length Alexander McQueen dress accessorized with a pearl drop necklace and pearl cocktail for a reception and black-tie dinner hosted by Britain's ambassador to France, Edward Llewellyn. Guests expected to attend the evening reception include actresses Kristen Scott Thomas, who played Queen Elizabeth II "The Audience" on Broadway, and Audrey Tatou and actor Jean Reno.

William and Kate were greeted for a series of photographs outside the Elysee Palace before they met with President Hollande for bilateral discussions inside the palace. Hollande later escorted the couple around the terrace for a view of the grounds.

William joked with President Hollande that he will be "cheering the Welsh" on Saturday when the French take on Wales in rugby at Stade de France. William, who will attend the match with Kate, is royal patron of the Welsh Rugby Union, a position he took over from his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, in December 2016.

William famously showed his solidarity with the French people just days after the November 2015 terror attack in Paris, which targeted Stade de France. William attended the England versus France soccer match at London's Wembley Stadium and sang the French national anthem in support.

Before departing London for Paris, William and Kate attended a traditional St. Patrick's Day event to honor the Irish Guards.

William, who is colonel of the Irish Guards, and Kate visited the 1st Battalion Irish Guards at their base and later joined officers and their families for a pint of Guinness.

The event was William's first official engagement since a weekend-long break in Switzerland where he was caught "dad dancing" at a nightclub and criticized for missing an important Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey attended by other members of the royal family.

William and Kate left their two young children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, at home during their Paris visit.

The couple is reportedly staying at the British ambassador's residence during their visit. The residence, built in the 18th century, is one of the best known buildings in Paris and is located close to Elysee Palace.

On Saturday, William and Kate will also visit Les Invalides, a Paris landmark known for its golden dome that includes the Tomb of Napoleon, to highlight its work with veterans. They will also meet with survivors and first responders from the July 2016 terror attack in Nice, France, and the November 2015 terror attack in Paris.

35th Ambassador Plaque Unveiled

DOWNTOWN BIZ, EXCHANGE BIZ AND WEST END BIZ HONOURED FOR THEIR OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMUNITY

In recognition of their outstanding contributions to the planning and organization of the International Downtown Association Annual Conference and Tradeshow in September 2017, the RBC Convention Centre acknowledged the Downtown Biz, Exchange Biz and West End Biz with the induction into its prestigious Ambassador Plaque Program.

At a reception on April 20th, the 35th Ambassador Plaque was unveiled and has joined a group of highly distinguished associations and organizations on the Centre’s Wall of Fame, located just inside the York Avenue entrance of the north building.

The Ambassador Plaque Program was initiated in 1994 to recognize those individuals and groups whose efforts have been integral to bringing conventions and events to our city. These people, many of whom volunteer their time and services, have a tremendous impact on this community, on both a social and economic level, as well as on the City of Winnipeg and the Convention Centre.

“The Ambassador Plaque Program is all about recognition,” said Drew Fisher, President and CEO, RBC Convention Centre. “It’s important that we take the time to recognize the work done on behalf of one’s local community that allows it to grow, prosper, celebrate and take pride in its achievements. We understand what it takes to make a conference like this happen. Initial conversations with Stefano Grande from the Downtown Biz dates back to 2010 and it was because of his influence at the Board and Executive level, that he was able to ‘Bring it Home’”.

The Convention Centre works closely with Tourism Winnipeg and Economic Development Winnipeg and its “Bring it Home” program which is designed to help Winnipeg leaders promote the city and bring meetings and conventions home. The meeting and convention business is Canada’s quiet economic giant that generates billions of dollars every year in diversified economic impacts.

“When a convention delegate is visiting out city, they spend approximately $325 per day. From accommodations, food, entertainment, supply and transportation, their spending ends up practically everywhere in the local economy,” Fisher adds. “With Winnipeg attracting larger conventions and trade shows that may have never considered our city as an option before, that is good news for everyone.”

The International Downtown Association is the premier organization for urban place professionals who are shaping and activating dynamic city centre districts which represents an industry of more than 2,500 place management organizations throughout North America and growing rapidly around the world.

Kingstowne in Alexandria VA | Planned Community with Character

One of the greatest things about living on-base is having a sense of community, knowing your neighbors, and having social events. When PCSing to the DC area, living on-base isn’t an option for the majority of military families. Finding where to live can be the hardest part of getting orders to DC. If you are looking for a sense of community, ability to get to know your neighbors, and looking for a place with planned social events then the planned community of Kingstowne is just the place for you.

Kingstowne in Alexandria, VA

The Washington Post wrote an article titled “Kingstowne: a vast planned community with hyperlocal traditions“.

Here is a summary of the article:

It’s a planned community with lots of traditions and social activities. Many military live here and commute to DC and Ft. Belvoir. The community is made up of apartments, townhomes, single-family homes and has two community centers, two large pool complexes, tennis courts, fitness facilities, and a wide variety of neighborhood clubs and sponsored events. Kingstowne is the second-largest planned community in Fairfax County with 5,500 homes located on the western edge of Alexandria just outside the Capital Beltway. Residents refer to the Kingstowne area as both the community of Kingstowne itself and the surrounding neighborhoods in zip code 22315 and parts of 22310. The general boundaries are Franconia Road to the north, Van Dorn Street to the east, Telegraph Road to the south and Beulah Street to the west. Home prices range from $300,000 – $800,000.

A quote from the article states “One of our more notable [social events] is that we have ‘Palm Tree Nights’ where the hosting neighbor gets to put the electric palm tree outside their house as a signal that other neighbors are welcome to stop by that evening for happy hour, snacks and neighborly conversation,” Sawyer said. “This has proven to be a really great way for neighbors to really get to know each other.”

Nearby is a shopping center with a Kohls, Walmart, World Market, Giant Food super market, and a Wegmans coming soon. The area is pedestrian-friendly, with trees, a movie theater and sidewalk seating for some restaurants. See full Washington Post article here

Schools are aligned to Fairfax County School System because Kingstowne is located in the lower part of Alexandria which is in Fairfax County. This is a highly sought after school district in the DC area.

Commuting from Kingstowne can take about 30-45 minutes. You can take the bus from the neighborhood to Van Dorn Metro to Pentagon. About 45 min door to door and it is 100% covered by subsidy. Or many make the two-mile drive to the Franconia-Springfield Metro station. Learn about Mass Transportation Benefit Program.

New Solar Panel Productto Reduce Costs Up To 10%

by Ivan Penn
Los Angeles Times, October 25, 2015

A new solar panel product that will reduce costs by as much as 10% is expected to go into production by the end of the year under an agreement reached with the world's largest renewable energy company.

SunEdison Inc., which operates its solar headquarters in Belmont, Calif., plans to begin production of a component that will increase the efficiency of solar panels by the end of the year. The solar panel module is expected to reduce total residential costs by about 10%, commercial costs by about 8% and utility scale costs by about 6%.

The component, created by Fremont, Calif.,-based company, Solaria Corp., will reduce costs because it makes solar panels more efficient. The module increases output of solar panels by 15%, the company said.

As a result, home, business or utility-scale solar projects will require fewer solar panels to produce the same amount of electricity and require less labor, wiring and materials.

"What we can do is make the solar industry 5% to 10% more cost effective," said Suvi Sharma, Solaria's chief executive.

Solar panels make up about 20% of the cost of solar installations. Panels now cost 50 to 60 cents a watt to make, compared to $2 to $3 a watt just five years ago.

Solaria's technology reduces the amount of wasted space in the panels.

"These new modules are our most efficient yet, and are ideally suited for homes and businesses where space is limited," said Bang Nguyen, SunEdison's vice president of solar materials operations.

SolarCity announced this month that had built a high-efficiency panel that the company says will generate more power per square foot and harvest more energy than any other on the market.

Sharma said the SolarCity panel is a more costly technology, while his company's product will help the broader market reduce costs.

This chronology documents the history of the Empire Ranch between 1928 and 1969. In 1928, the Empire Ranch was purchased by the Chiricahua Ranches Company (CRC), successor to the Chiricahua Cattle Company (CCC) and the Boice, Gates & Johnson Company. The CRC was incorporated by three Boice brothers, Henry Gudgell, Frank Seymour, and Charles Gudgell. Cattle ranching was a family business begun by their father, Henry Stephen Boice, so the chronology includes the history that led to the Boice family ownership of the Empire Ranch.. Boice Family Ranching History, 1859-1928. Chiricahua Ranches Company Ownership, 1928-1951. Frank & Mary Boice Family Ownership, 1951-1969. This chronology is a work in progress.

Cerebellar foliation in rats. 5. Structural relations between Purkinje cells and heterotopic external granular layer in normal and protein deprived foetal rats.
Different types of heterotopia of granule cells and of the external granular layer (EGL) occur naturally in the cerebellum of rats. In the present study sagittal plastic sections of the cerebellum of 75 normal and protein deprived rat foetuses from the four last days of gestation were examined. Perivascular nests of EGL cells were present in all of the rat foetuses examined without obvious differences between normal and protein deprived foetuses. They were most frequent in regions adjacent to the fissures. It was found that the EGL nests affected the orientation and position of Purkinje cells when passing through this layer. In 2 out of 37 protein deprived foetuses, there were continuous layers of Purkinje cells surrounding some EGL nests in the sub-cortical region associated with a malformation of the posterior lobe. These heterotopic Purkinje cells had an apical process mostly pointing towards the EGL nests and there was a primitive molecular layer lying between the heterotopic Purkinje cells and the EGL cells. These findings indicate that migration of Purkinje cells towards the perivascular EGL had occurred possibly as a consequence of transfer of the endfeet of radial glial cells from the pial to the vascular mesodermal surface. Similar mechanisms may be involved in nervous system malformations such as cerebellar polymicrogyria in man. Experimental protein deprivation has not previously been reported to result in major malformations of the central nervous system. Although two protein deprived foetuses had cerebellar malformation which were not seen in normal foetuses, the present material does not allow any conclusions with regard to a causal relation between the protein deprivation and the malformations.

An epidemiological survey demonstrating decline in reproductive efficiency with age and non-seasonality of reproductive parameters in German shepherd bitches in Kenya.
An epidemiological survey undertaken in Kenya indicated that 2 previously well-established factors, namely decline in reproductive efficiency with age, and non-seasonality of canine reproductive parameters, hold true for German shepherd (GSD) bitches in Kenya. Data collection forms were distributed to randomly selected GSD breeders and information so obtained was verified using East African Kennel Club records. Whelping was recorded throughout the year. The litter size varied from 1 to 14 pups per litter with a mean of 6.3 +/- 0.4 SD puppies. Records of 567 whelpings and 3592 puppies were studied. The mean monthly whelping rate was 47.3 +/- 7.2. There was no significant difference in the mean litter size by month (P < 0.05).

1. Field of the Invention
This invention relates to water flow measuring devices and is more particularly directed to an apparatus for measuring the total forces generated by surface and sub-surface currents and other water movements.
2. Description of the Prior Art
At the present time, there is no single apparatus or device capable of determining or measuring with a significant degree of accuracy, the total forces generated by waves and currents of a water column, either continuously or at any specific time. This information is invaluable to scientists and engineers concerned with ocean dynamics having to do with the forces constantly and consistantly being generated by waves, surface and sub-surface currents.
There are two distinct groups or types of apparatus for measuring current fields, from which forces and kinetic energy of a water column can be deduced. The first group includes the taut and compliant instrumented lines in which there are a number of spaced instruments that either record current velocity and direction in the case of the taut wire array or line shape resulting from the forces of the current acting on the compliant line. These systems are highly inaccurate for measuring total instrument forces of the water column for the reason that the instruments are spaced some distance from each other along the full length of the line, leaving unmeasured currents passing the lines between the spaced instruments.
The second method is the free drop or vertically cycling devices in which a water flow measuring instrument moves vertically and measures the entire water column over the period of time that it takes for the instrument to travel the length of the line so that the measure of total forces is not known for any specific moment or time, thereby being at least to that extent, inaccurate in the determination of total forces being generated by the column of water.
My U.S. Pat. No. 3,372,585, belongs to the compliant line group, having a number of slope and azimuth indicators mounted on the line. The accuracy of this apparatus can be no greater than the number of data points derived from instruments attached along the length of the line; the greater the number of instruments mounted on the line, the greater the accuracy; but in any event, this apparatus or any other conventional apparatus is not as accurate as the present invention, as well as being most cumbersome in execution and extremely costly.

QuestionsHow to growTrees and ShrubsChoosing trees and shrubsSupporting a new hedge in a windy site. I recently planted a long hedge of laurel of about 7ft in height. They had been in containers before planting. The site is very windy and the trees will need to be supported. Can you suggest a way of tieing them that will not damage the tree and will not involve staking each plant individually.. 1 Answers. Individual stakes would be best … these can be short stakes well driven and tied about 30cm or 40 cm above soil level, designed to hold the root ball steady.. You could also set up a few strong posts, the two ends with supporting stakes at a 45 degree angle and two tightened wires. The posts would need to be set at about 5 metres apart along the length of the row. Heavy wire, about 8 gauge, would need to be used and tightened off with fencing turnbuckles.. This support would be essentially a two-strand wire fence. The lower stand could be placed at about 50cm and the higher one at 1.2 metres.

Early on, most of the scientific literature was highly technical and concerned with the chemical properties of various plants, especially herbs.

Yet very little was being done to determine the medicinal value of these substances — that is, actual scientific studies on the effects of plant extracts.

But then, because of the recognition that many extracts produced powerful medicinal effects, the number of scientific studies increased exponentially.

Today, we not only understand how these compounds can help treat a wide range of diseases, we also understand, sometimes in great detail, how they are affecting cell processes associated with health and disease.

In addition, the better manufacturers have greatly improved their extraction and purification techniques, making plant extracts of much higher quality, with strengths that exceed pharmaceutical drugs many times over.

Recently, some of these manufacturers have directed their attention toward improving the compounds’ bioavailability, which refers to how well they are absorbed from the gut and distributed to the various tissue and organs.

Improving bioavailability is absolutely essential to getting the benefits from these substances.

Abstract. We surveyed 107 chairs and chiefs of US dermatology programs regarding demographic and educational factors. Of the 69 (64%) participants who returned completed surveys, 59 (86%) were men and 10 (14%) were women. We compared our data from chairs and chiefs to the US dermatology workforce and found that the chairs and chiefs were significantly more likely to be older men who were board certified in other fields, trained in dermatopathology, and specialized in Mohs micrographic surgery (P< .001). Many chairs and chiefs also actively participated in research and held advanced degrees in addition to doctor of medicine.. ASJC Scopus subject areas. - Dermatology

It’s a common belief that great horned owls are nocturnal, although they are actually crepuscular, which means they prefer to hunt dusk and dawn. They will, however, also hunt in the middle of the night, and aren’t against coming out of their tree to grab up a meal in the middle of the day. Great horns prefer to spend their days camouflaged in trees, making it is hard to spot them. This is one of the reasons our great horned owl, Teasdale, is popular with our guests, who have rarely, if ever, seen one. In this blog post, I am sharing six of my favorite facts about great horned owls.

This great horned owl blended right in with our Russian olive tree.

1) Great horned owls are one of only a few species of animals that regularly eat skunks. Since owls only have enough sense of smell to enable them to taste food, great horned owls don’t have a clue as to how awful the skunk smells, they only know they taste good. Of course, we don’t want to smell skunk, so no skunk for Teasdale!

Teasdale, our handsome great horned owl.

2) I am sure that you have all noticed that great horned owls appear to have ears similar to mammals. These are not really ears, but are just tufts of feathers, called plumicorns. One third of the owl species in the U.S. have plumicorns. So where are their ears? They are hidden under the curved lines of dark feathers that form a facial disc on either side of their face. The great horned owl can actually raise these short facial disk feathers to amplify sound, similar to you putting your hands behind your ears. They can hear a mouse moving under of foot of snow, and probably hear a mouse moving on the forest floor from a football field away. What is even more interesting is that their ears are actually offset with the right ear being a little higher than the left. This causes sound to reach one ear at a fraction of a second before it reaches the other. When the owl tilts its head until the sound equalizes, it will be staring right at his prey.

Teasdale on the glove.

3) Teasdale’s feet are large and strong, making them deadly weapons. When a great horned reaches with its feet fully extended, it can cover an area of 31 square inches! Combined with their ability to squeeze up to 500 pounds per square inch, this deadly, crushing grip will often kill prey instantly. Notice the short feathers that cover Teasdale’s legs and feet right down to his talons. These feathers are touch sensitive. If a great horn grasps something and it moves, these feathers help it know that it has caught prey, and doesn’t just have a foot full of leaves and sticks.

Teasdale’s forward-facing eyes make his gaze seem more like a human’s, as well as more intense.

4) Great horned owls have excellent eyesight, and can see well in bright light, as well as almost total darkness, though they have no color vision. Since they prefer to hunt at dusk and dawn, color vision is not needed. Their sight is, however, triggered by movement. The owl may be looking right at a mouse that is not moving, and not see it. However, the instant the mouse even twitches a whisker, the owl will spot it. A great horned owl is capable of spotting a mouse a football field away, even in low light conditions. In fact, if you put a great horned owl in a football stadium, lit by only one candle, there would be enough light for the great horned to hunt.

Fringe-like structures on the edges of wing feathers.

5) If you have ever had an owl pass closely overhead, you may have noticed its silent flight. This is due to the soft, fringe-like structures on the edges of its wing feathers. The above photo clearly shows this feather structure. This structure allows the air to easily slip through the feathers, making them totally silent. As an owl drops down from its perch, or moves low above the ground, the silent flight enables the owl to continue to hear the movement of its prey, as well as preventing its prey from being alerted to the owl due to sound.

6) Great horned owls are sometimes called hoot owls, as they have a distinctive “hoo-hoo-hoooo hoo-hoo” sound. But did you know that they make a lot of other sounds as well? They also growl, scream, bark, shriek, and hiss. If you are lucky enough to hear a mated pair calling back and fourth, you can tell which is the male and which is the female, as the male has a deeper voice. Along with these different vocalizations, they also use their beaks to make snapping sounds.

These two links contain just a few of the great horned owl’s sounds:

Teasdale gives you another look at his facial disk line.

Question from visitor:

Can owls turn their heads completely around?

Teasdale, like us, can easily look to his side, but from there, he can continue to look directly behind himself, then continue to look over to the opposite side, all in one turn. He cannot, however, continue turning his head all the way around. Great horns can turn their heads 270 degrees (three quarters of the way around), while most other birds can only turn their heads 180 degrees. This is partly due to the fact that they have 14 vertebrae in their necks, twice as many as we do. There is a lot more to it than that, however, so if you are interested in learning even more about what makes it possible for an owl to turn its head 270 degrees, here is an excellent video:

(CBS DETROIT) – The Detroit City Council approved a law for the operation of recreational marijuana shops. The council unanimously approved it in a 9-0 vote. The law, led by Detroit City Councilman James Tate, also has provisions to give residents priority and guarantees all licenses awarded in Detroit will go to “legacy” residents. Qualifications for the legacy certification requires residents to have lived in Detroit for 15 of the last 30 years, lived in Detroit 13 of the 30 years and are low-income, lived in Detroit for 10 of the last 30 years and have a prior marijuana related conviction Lawmakers say this will prevent marginalized groups from being locked out of the billion dollar industry. The new ordinance is expected to go into effect in January.

Thinking about getting a Pool for Next Summer?

I met with Jim Jr of L&J Pools located in Bethel, Connecticut. L&J Pools has an interesting history; Jim Sr. started his construction business in 1975, where he built many subdivisions, roads, foundations for houses and more. After Jim Sr. built his own house he decided he wanted to get a pool, and so he built himself a pool. Jim’s friends and family were so impressed and in awe of his custom built concrete wall, vinyl liner pool that he was inspired and driven to get into the pool business.​Jim Sr. started his custom pool building business out of his garage in Redding, CT in 1984. And after years of success and growth Jim Sr moved his business from his garage to a commercial building with a showroom and concrete plant in Bethel, CT. L&J Pools is still family owned and operated, Jim Sr. along with his wife and 3 children and more employees, work together to provide quality custom pools throughout Connecticut. Their pool company has many satisfied pool owners in Danbury, New Fairfield, Ridgefield, Brookfield and other areas of CT.

Besides the Pool Building Business do you do anything else?

L&J Pools is much more than just a vinyl liner and gunite pool building company. Jim Sr. got into the pool business when new construction sales where slowing down. Also when he had received great feedback from his friends and family after building his own inground pool, weighed in his decision. In 1987 he started a Heating Oil company to accompany the Pool business since the pool company is seasonal. His Heating Oil Company would be able to keep his guys busy in the off season.​Fiorilla Heating Oil does automatic deliveries throughout Fairfield County and the lower half of Litchfield County. Their website at fiorillaheatingoil.com is very user friendly; customers can go online to see what the current rate is, select the day for delivery, and even pay online. Fiorilla Heating Oil regularly posts their daily cash price on Facebook (@fiorillaheatingoil), and when you follow you can receive Facebook only specials.

Whats the toughest thing about owning a Inground Pool Building Business in 2016?

Time is always difficult to manage says Jim Jr. “You’re basically married to the business, you’re here, and every single thing falls on your shoulders to make it all run smoothly. You’re the first one here, and the last one to leave. The favorite part of my day is getting home to my family.” Jim Jr. lives locally, and is the father to three little girls.​“Another thing that our pool company needs to deal with is the constant fees, licenses, and high requirements just to clean a pool.” Jim proceeded to explain everything to me about the SP-1, SPB licenses needed to run a successful pool company, but it was too overwhelming for me to follow.

If a Customer was looking to get a Custom Pool Built, and was to choose between your Pool Company, and three others like it - Why Choose L&J Pools?

Jim Jr. explains, “We build the pool, patio, fencing, etc., from the start of your project to the finished product and everything in between, everything is done in house. We mix our own concrete so we don’t have to rely on any one. On top of that my father, Jim Sr. is a licensed septic installer so he can relocate your septic tank if required. Most of the pool guys in Danbury and Bethel just build vinyl liner pools. We of course build vinyl liner pools as well, but we also build custom gunite pools. A gunite pool is a commercial grade swimming pool, and it is top of the line. Vinyl liners are kit pools, and have specific dimensions. Our customers love our gunite pools because they are completely customizable. We make swimming pools to fit our customer’s individual needs.”​Besides listening to information about pool licensing my interview with Jim Jr. was very interesting and had a lot of information to offer. I thought it was great that they created another company (Fiorilla Heating Oil) on top of the Pool Company to provide their seasonal employees with work during the off season, which shows great character. I know where I’ll be going to get a pool…. Eventually!

Activated liver stellate cells in chronic viral C hepatitis: histopathological and immunohistochemical study.
There is positive correlation between the number of activated hepatic stellate cells and necroinflammatory activity and/or the stage of liver fibrosis in viral hepatitis. No study has investigated such a relationship with regard to the activated hepatic cells within specified zones of liver tissue in chronic C hepatitis. The aim of the present study was to correlate the level of activated hepatic stellate cells within perivenular, intermediate, periportal, and portal tracts area and fibrous septa with stages of liver fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity in patients with chronic C hepatitis. This retrospective study included 20 liver biopsy samples from patients with chronic C hepatitis and 10 normal liver biopsies. Biopsy specimens were processed routinely and stained with haematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, Masson;s trichrome, aldechide fuchsin, reticulin and iron (Pearls). Activated hepatic stellate cells were identified immunohistochemically using antibody to alpha-smooth muscle actin. Assessment of immunoreactivity was performed using a semiquantitative method. In chronic C hepatitis, a positive correlation between the stage of fibrosis and the number of activated hepatic stellate cells within portal spaces and fibrous septa was found. These cells were increased in number in other areas of liver tissue as well, but without statistical significance. There was no correlation between either the stage of fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity or the number of activated hepatic stellate cells and necroinflammatory activity. An increased number of activated hepatic stellate cells within portal spaces and fibrous septa may be a useful prognostic marker for the development of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in chronic C hepatitis.

Make Bright Choices For Earth Day

With Earth Day coming up on April 22nd you may be wondering if you have done enough to help our planet and what more you can do. The very best way to improve our health, and that of our planet, is to utilize our purchasing power. Making smart choices in the products you buy, from food to cosmetics, not only creates a healthier lifestyle for you and your family, but also creates a higher demand for safe products. This, in turn, necessitates safer farming and manufacturing processes, improving our soil, water and earth.

Earth Day was founded by U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson (D-Wisconsin) as a way to inspire awareness in the environment, with hopes of gaining attention for environmental issues in Washington DC. The first Earth Day was held on April 22 1970, on the spring equinox.

And what more perfect time to celebrate our Earth than the season of change. As we welcome sunshine, fresh air and greenery back into our lives we also tend to make changes in our diets, activities and clothing.

Fruits and vegetables are more enticing than heavier foods. Buying organically grown and local if possible, is one simple way to give back to your Earth while eating healthy. Growing some of your own veg is another.

Ride your bike or walk to work, if that is an option, to cut down on gas and emissions while enjoying some sunshine and getting your daily dose of vitamin D. Just be sure to apply sun block if you plan to be out for more than 15 minutes.

Put away the blacks and grays in your wardrobe in favor of more vibrant color. But colorful options don’t only apply to clothing, remember to update your makeup for the season as well.

If you are here chances are good that you have already made the switch to natural skincare. What have you done to green up the more colorful items in your beauty arsenal? You need to be sure these are non-toxic too.

Organic make up has come a long way baby, offering gorgeous color, natural coverage and long-lasting wear-ability. Mineral makeup provides beautiful, natural hues perfect for all skin types. For spring, try swapping blacks and browns for greens and blues. Not ready for quite that much color? Light neutrals with brown accents play up features while creating a fresh, natural look. Try our Organic Cosmetic Starter Kits in brown or blue.

Rather than thinking big this Earth Day, try keeping the little things in mind. Each purchase, no matter how small, has a big impact overall.

Q:

How to use a sass $ declaration in useEffect (jsx?)

I have different styles set in a _variables.scss file. like 
$secondary: #ffc500;
$tertiary: #ffdd69;
$quartiary: #fffbed;

I want to use different body colors so I want to change the body background in different pages like so:
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red"  });

this works nicely but now i want to use for example $primary instead of 'red'
I just can't make it work. does anybody have an idea?

A:

You can use the sass :export keyword to pass variables from sass files to js files:
// colors.scss
$primary: #123456;
:export {
  primary: $primary;
}

// main.js
import colors from './colors.scss'

colors.primary; // '#123456'

As far as I know this is a non-standard keyword, it is handled by webpack + sass-loader, but not all sass transpilers.



4 Ways to Flex Our Electoral Muscles

The Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United revealed just how thoroughly the American people (people, I should clarify, in the traditional sense) have lost control over our own democracy.

But it’s far from the only way that corporations now circumvent true democratic decision-making. There are lots of other problems that need fixing—and that can be fixed now, at the state and local level, without waiting for a constitutional amendment.

1. Disclosure

Citizens United effectively removed the limits that state and federal laws had placed on how much money corporations and other groups can spend to influence elections—but it didn’t dispute the constitutionality of laws that mandate disclosing how that money is spent. In the six months immediately after Citizens United was handed down, 10 states responded by passing laws requiring more transparency—disclosure of how much money outside groups are spending, what they’re spending it on, and so forth. The California Legislature is currently debating the strongest disclosure law to date: It would require that all political ads show the logos of their three largest funders (not PACs, but the originating corporations) on the ads themselves.

2. Clean Elections

In Maine, only 20 percent of candidates accept private campaign contributions. Instead, qualifying candidates (candidates who receive a certain number of $5 contributions from voters) finance their campaigns through the state’s Clean Elections Fund. The results? Lack of wealth doesn’t keep people from running for office; candidates are insulated from the influence of corporate special interests; they spend more time talking to voters and less time fundraising than in other states. The cost? Less than $2 per taxpayer.

Similar systems are in use in Arizona, Connecticut, and a number of other states. A federal system has been repeatedly introduced in Congress, including a 2007 bill ­co-sponsored by then-­Senator Barack Obama.

3. Citizen Juries

Since the Progressive Era, citizens’ initiatives have been a way for regular people to propose laws, bypassing elected officials by putting proposals directly to the electorate. But first, deep-pocketed corporate entities with a stake in the outcome have their chance to sway voters; ordinary citizens rarely have the money to counter. To make sure voters have access to unbiased information about what they’re voting on, a new Oregon law creates juries of randomly selected citizens whose job is to learn the issues, study the proposed legislation, and separate fact from fiction. Their findings are then mailed to the homes of registered voters.Citizen juries have also been used, though unofficially, to help voters sift through information in gubernatorial and senate races in Pennsylvania and Minnesota.

4. Recalls

What can citizens do when elected officials stand up for corporations at their expense? In a number of states, they’ve recently turned to recall elections. In the last year, citizens have engineered the recall of Wisconsin officials who passed the anti-union Budget Repair Bill (a recall against Gov. Scott Walker and Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch is pending); a Michigan state representative who supported a similar bill; and the Arizona state senator who sponsored the draconian anti-immigrant bill SB 1070 (which was written with the help of the private prison industry).

Nineteen states currently allow citizen recalls of state officials (Illinois became the latest, in 2010); at least 26 allow recalls of local officials.

Interested?

For more than a decade, a groundbreaking Clean Elections law has helped
protect Maine politics from the influence of big money. But what’s
happening now that big spenders have free rein to influence
elections—and what does it mean for the rest of the country?

A new law that puts voters in charge of breaking through political spin
could be a first step in making policy decisions that work.

A Person-Centered Approach to Cardiovascular Genetic Testing.
Cardiovascular genetic counselors provide guidance to people facing the reality or prospect of inherited cardiovascular conditions. Key activities in this role include discussing clinical cardiac screening for at-risk family members and offering genetic testing. Psychological factors often influence whether patients choose to have genetic testing and how they understand and communicate the results to at-risk relatives, so psychological counseling increases the impact of genetic education and medical recommendations. This work reviews the literature on the factors that influence patient decisions about cardiovascular genetic testing and the psychological impact of results on people who opt to test. It also models use of a psychological framework to apply themes from the literature to routine cardiovascular genetic counseling practice. Modifications of the framework are provided to show how it can be adapted to serve the needs of both new and experienced genetic counselors.

Name: Xixas AverallAge/Grade: 15/FreshmanGender: MaleHeight: 5'11Weight: 153 lbsAppearance: Xixas holds a masculine frame, scarcely visible through his constant veiling attire. His lanky body seemingly hiding the muscle on his body with length. From the early years of farm work, and the latter of construction. The strife of living shows itself in the form of scars, stretching across his arms and back, the history of these markings come in the form accidents, brawls, and challenging step-parents. Once he moved to the city, his habit of apparel drastically changed with the environment from ragged jeans, dirty shorts, and tank tops to a crisp, clean cut and stylish form of his mother's version of "proper dress". The farm clothes were traded for designer jeans, stylish button downs, and even the occasional suit.

Xixas has dark, oak hair that seems to fade to black during the Fall and Winter. His hair is the only part of him that's stayed true to the farm. Messy, kinky, and a ravaged to barely a degree of style. His eyes are a stately silver, the pigments of blue, green, and brown conform within his irises to present a tanned hazel, the silver only seeming to appear on the gloomiest of days.

Relations: A step-father, a step-mother, and a genetic mother. As well as a step-brother and sister.

Sexuality: Xixas is heterosexual, but doesn't contain a lot of protruding hormones that dictate the average man. His respect for women, as well as his lack of knowledge on the matter of "sex" other than that of home school, keeps his mentality in check, almost seeming to be sexually abstinent.

Preferences: Xixas doesn't necessarily have any preferences in the form presented. He has seen all forms of women and men, and very rarely ever felt attracted to any of them, strictly being women, having no feelings romantically for the same sex. However, nothing ever grew beyond piqued interest, never arousal. Xixas read a library's worth during his time alive, and has always enjoyed the romance of the unique. Xixas believes there is someone for everyone in every sense, just as there's someone to enchant and potentially arouse him too. So, Xixas' preferences are those of the unique, that he has only seen in books.

History: Xixas, Six as his friends call him, is a stoic man. He was born in the mountains, raised on a farm until his early teens where he moved to live with his mother in the city. He was home schooled until fifteen, and there he started school. Xixas appears to be shy, but he has a good level of confidence. He doesn't speak quite often unless to one worth rambling to. He is intelligent, and adamant to a fault. Loyal, and has quite the soft spot for anyone to grab his interest. However, Xixas is easily identified by the staple smile on his face, grinning with confidence.

Xixas was born away from society, deep within a mountain range when his genetic parents were attempting to escape the world. Once he was born, his parents bought a farm miles from actual society, and here he was raised. When he was five, his father passed away from a terrible accident. After four years, his mother re-married to a horrible man, needing the money he could offer to provide for Xixas, and their family legacy. The step-father, was Xixas' uncle. Eventually, his uncle drove his mother away with his intending awful treatment, his wealth and corruption of society giving him precedence over little Xixas. His step-father married another woman, his uncle's first ex-wife, and brought his children to the farm. His uncle worked Xixas to the bone, with practically inhumane treatment for him. His step-siblings acted like brats to Xixas in their father's presence, being in the same age range as Xixas himself. But alone, they were all the best of friends. After much legal work, pleading, and several amounts of drama, Xixas moved to the city with his genetic mother at thirteen years old. Begrudgingly leaving his siblings behind, he lived with his mother. He obtained an under-the-counter construction job for his strength, and put it to good use to support them both. Now, two years later, he decided to attend public school. Here, a new chapter of Xixas' life is going to be written, and he couldn't be more curious.

EEG correlates of perceptual reversals in Boring's ambiguous old/young woman stimulus.
Ambiguous figures attract observers because perception alternates between different interpretations while the sensory information stays unchanged. Understanding the underlying processes is difficult because the precise time instant of this endogenous reversal event needs to be known but is difficult to measure. Presenting ambiguous figures discontinuously and using stimulus onset as estimation of the reversal event increased temporal resolution and provided a series of well-confirmed EEG signatures. In the current EEG study we used this 'onset paradigm' for the first time with Boring's old/young woman stimulus. We found an early occipital event-related potential (ERP) correlate of reversals between the perception of the old woman and the perception of the young woman that fits well with previous ERP findings. This component was not followed by the often-reported occipito-parietal Reversal Negativity at 260 ms, but instead by an occipito-temporal N170, that is typically reported with face stimuli. We interpret our results as follows: ambiguity conflicts take place during processing of stimulus elements in early visual areas roughly 130 ms after stimulus onset. The disambiguation of these elements and their assembly to object 'gestalts' result from an interplay between early visual and object-specific brain areas in a temporal window between 130 and 260 ms after stimulus onset. In the particular case of Boring's old/young woman the processes of element disambiguation and gestalt construction are already finished at 170 ms and, thus, 90 ms earlier than in the case of ambiguous geometric figures (eg Necker cube or Schroeder staircase) or of binocular rivalrous gratings.

Abstract. We employed Ba-Cu-O substrates for fabrication of bulk Y-Ba-Cu-O superconductors in the top-seeded melt-growth method. There were several advantages for a use of a Ba-Cu-O substrate compared to conventional substrate materials such as MgO, ZrO2, Al2O3, RE123 and RE211 (RE rare earth). The Ba-Cu-O substrate avoided crystallization from a substrate, suppressed a liquid loss and then scarcely reacted with a precursor. Furthermore, the introduction of large-sized cracks into a grown bulk greatly was suppressed by propagating along the interface between a grown bulk and a substrate. We could obtain bulk Y-Ba-Cu-O superconductors with uniform trapped magnetic filed distributions and equal maximum trapped filed values on both top and bottom surfaces, which indicates that the field-trapping capabilities were homogenized along the c-axes of the bulks fabricated on the Ba-Cu-O substrates..

Here’s a couple more ink test promo images for the first issue of a new comic I’m working on with my friends Chuck Farmer (pencils) and Shawn Munguia (script). I’m contributing inks, lettering, toning and production to the mix. We’re pretty excited with these few practice images. We may wind up using some of them in the book. I’m also using different fonts for the title lettering. Feel free to let us know which one you think looks best!. The character featured in this preview is one of several human/animal “chimeras” that will be part of our story….

Hi, I am a student of IUPUI (indiana-University-Purdue University-Indianapolis). I would like to know how chimera can be used to select the amino acid residues of one chain of a protein, which are within a certain distance (say 10A) of another chain of the same protein. For example, the pdb 1o6s has two chains A and B. I would like to find what amino acid residues of A chain of 1o6s are within 10A of B chain of 1o6s. I am eagerly expecting a reply from your end. Thanks Ang

Meditation shifts your focus to something quiet and calm, reducing inflammation and pain. “When you can get into that quieter state of mind through meditation, your body isn't releasing stress hormones into the bloodstream”. “The brain can then release endorphins, which is a natural pain reliever” says Dr. Sterling Carter, PT, DPT. You may have meditated or heard about meditation, but what you might not know is that meditation is one of the most effective methods of treating pain. Pain comes with stress, depression, anxiety among other symptoms. Fortunately, meditation can treat pain and associated symptoms. The VIP PT method uses meditation therapy as a component of our all-inclusive program that provides guaranteed results in less time.. Understanding Meditation. Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years. Meditation originally was meant to help deepen the.

[Evaluation of the anesthetic risk in patients with coronary disease prior to non-cardiac surgery].
Evaluation of operative risk in coronary artery disease patients before non-cardiac surgery is a frequent problem concerning 100,000 patients each year in France. Perioperative cardiac morbidity is the first cause of death associated with non-cardiac surgery, with infarction rates of the order of 1 to 2% in coronary disease patients. These infarcts are followed by the death of the patient in 25 to 50% of cases. Evaluation of anesthetic risk is based upon three points: type of surgery, clinical findings and results of investigations. The risk is markedly increased in emergency surgery, and in thoracic, intraperitoneal and above all vascular surgery, in particular when clamping of the aorta is involved. From a clinical standpoint, only a history of infarction and signs of peripheral cardiac failure are independent predictive factors of postoperative complications. Other criteria, e.g. age, uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes and above all the severity of angina are also associated with the onset of perioperative-complications. This evaluation can be refined by electrocardiogram (Q wave, ST segment anomalies, ventricular hypertrophy and left bundle branch block) and chest X-ray. The usefulness and predictive value of exercise tests, when possible in a preoperative context, are particularly precious when the result is positive at low work-load. Many publications have studied the value of myocardial isotope scan, in particular before vascular surgery. They report the excellent negative predictive value (95 to 100%) of this investigation. Furthermore, the predictive value of isotope scan is all the greater when the clinical risk factors seen in the patients and the number of areas with ischemia are taken into account.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

A habit I have developed in my time here at C of I is writing down things that professors say. Yes, I know, everyone takes notes, but these are more random, weird and funny quotes that I will remember for a very long time.. Because I’m majoring in political economy, these are all quotes from the POE professors, but I think they’re quite hilarious. I’ve spent a lot of time collecting these (plus it makes class go a lot faster!), so here are some of my favorites:. “We are all, in other words, prostitutes.” – Hunter (he's famous for this one).

Enjoying food without caloric cost: The impact of brief mindfulness on laboratory eating outcomes.
Mindfulness-based interventions have been increasingly applied to treat eating-related problems ranging from obesity to eating disorders. Yet few studies have empirically examined the mechanisms of a mindful approach to eating. The current studies examine the potential of brief mindfulness instructions to enhance the psychological and behavioral dimensions of eating. In three experiments (total N = 319 undergraduates), we examined whether brief mindfulness instructions would enhance the positive sensory experience involved in tasting food as well as healthy eating behaviors. Relative to distraction control instructions, the first two studies demonstrated that brief mindfulness instructions increased the enjoyment of a commonly pleasurable food (chocolate; Study 1), and a food with generally more mixed associations (raisins; Study 2). The third study replicated and extended these findings to show that brief mindfulness instructions also led to lower calorie consumption of unhealthy food relative to distracted or no-instruction control conditions, an effect mediated by greater eating enjoyment. Findings demonstrated the power of brief mindfulness instructions to positively impact both health-relevant behavior and sensory experience associated with eating food. Implications for both theory and clinical applications of mindfulness are discussed.

Q:

Reading Signed/unsigned tx files

I'd like to transfer files between cold and hot wallets via QR codes. Python can't seem to decode/encode the bytes in the unsigned tx file. Can someone confirm they are mostly binary, and some sort of encryption scheme? Is there a way to decrypt then before rendering in QR?
I'm able to use the bitstring library to make the files into ones and zeroes, and make QR of that, but I don't know how to go in reverse to reconstitute the file on the other side. Is there a method for covering from 10001101... To the file again?

A:

Credit to @JollyMort 
the python base64 module can encode/decode the unsigned_tx file into ascii for transmission via QR code:
import base64
...
...
with open(args.infile, "rb") as source:
    with open(bitPath, 'wb') as dest:
        dest.write(base64.b64encode(source.read()))
<transmit sliced up bitpath file via qr codes as is now ASCII>

<on receive side, concatenate ascii qr codes to one file>
with open(asciiPath, "rb") as source:
    with open(stitchPath, 'wb') as dest:
        dest.write(base64.b64decode(source.read()))

file stitchPath should match original unsiged_monero_tx file



Finally, a title that doesn’t fit for all the right reasons.. The second full length from this Czech quartet will open far more doors for the group than it will close. From blasts of high-octane punk to more angular, Fugazi- or Husker-infused refrains, this excellent 12-song outing displays a frighteningly developed grasp on how to craft calculated explosions.. The record’s best played with speakers trembling, especially for floor-shaking tracks like “Lost,” “Sick” or “I Feel Bad.”. Anyway also harbors a great sense of pacing and keeps the disc from becoming redundant by knowing just when to cool things down (the moody lull of “Bar Song” or “Dirty Shoes”) or toss in a blood-curdling barnburner.. Much of the disc’s second half, beginning with the blistering one-two punch of “The Future” and “Cunny,” feels like a call to riot, all furious guitars and barked vocals. Consider it an invitation. – Punk Planet, January/February 2007

Today, the Carolina Panthers and defensive tackle Kawann Short agreed on a five-year deal worth $80MM, according to Adam Schefter of ESPN.com. Short becomes the fourth highest paid defensive tackle in the league.. In addition, he will make $40MM in the first two years of his deal and then the last three years average out to $16MM a year.. This is a smart move by the Panthers, as he is one of the main defenders on the team and that he is the best player on that defensive line.. Short came into the league back in 2013. Ever sense putting on that Panthers jersey, he has picked up 22 career sacks with 2015 being his best year in terms of sacks (11).. Now, Short had a good 2016 campaign by notching six sacks and picking up 55 tackles in all 16 games. The team took a step backwards, which hurt some of his production.. Finally, expect the former Purdue product to reach anywhere from eight to ten sacks this upcoming year.

Hannity and Pirro spent the night the broadcast from the rally while raising the crowd before Trump’s arrival . Hannity said on his show that he had “throwing soccer, signing hats and taking pictures” with members of the audience.. And after Hannity spoke with Trump backstage, Bill Shine, former Fox News president White House Communications Director, turned him a high five, according to the White House pool report.. While Fox News did not have an immediate comment on the Hannity Trump campaign on Monday night’s rally, the network had previously spoken when Hannity appeared in a 2016 Trump ad.. At that time, a Fox News spokesman said the network “had no knowledge” that Hannity had participated in the advertisement and added that he “would not do anything in this line for the rest of the election”.

Restorative justice is an approach of addressing harm or the risk of harm through engaging all those affected in coming to a common understanding and agreement on how the harm or wrongdoing can be repaired and justice achieved. It can be applied where people experience harm in society, in organisations, in schools, in families and in the justice system.. The following pages offer information on the specific areas where restorative justice can be beneficially applied and the principles and safeguards that apply to the particular domains. These information pages include indication for further resources (resource kits) and thematic and policy briefs that can be downloaded in PDF format. The list of these areas is not exhaustive, there are several other areas where restorative justice is applied well. The EFRJ continues to develop further information resourses and will share these here in the future.

Time To Dance

Leap year gave us a gift–24 extra hours. Seriously. it’s a brilliant idea to keep the world caught up with some extra time.There never seems to be enough time.

We are given a certain amount of time to live. In that time we are to live purposefully. If we are honest, most of us have wasted a significant amount of time.

Consider: For everything there is a season, a time for every activity under heaven. A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to harvest. A time to kill and a time to heal. A time to tear down and a time to build up. A time to cry and a time to laugh. A time to grieve and a time to dance. (Ecc. 3: 1-4, NLT).

So. Do you believe there is a time for everything, including death? What would happen if you had one more day to live?
What would be different?
What would be the same?

When my friend told me he did not have much time to live, I could not believe it . . . did not want to believe it . . . and hoped he did not believe it. We were young and healthy. It seemed like we had so much time ahead. But, somehow he knew.
So.
He asked some of us to dance in the rain. We did. At the time, it seemed random; however, looking back I see that it was part of his legacy. It was as if it released us to be free in the moment and grateful to be alive.

A few months later, he was hit on an Oregon highway by a drunk driver. He was injured, more than we knew at the time. We sat and talked on a rainy afternoon as he lay in his hospital bed. His words were memorable; he said to consider the day as a gift of life to be experienced . . . celebrated . . . and remembered. And, he reminded me to take time to dance in the rain. He took his last breath on earth a few days later.

There’s a time to dance.

Dancing At Tiffany's Wedding

The thing is . . . I want to spend more time dancing in the rain and less time complaining about the rain.

Day 15 of 40-days of intentional gratefulness: Grateful there’s a time to dance. So. I will.

School nursing services: the early years.
This is the first in a series of three articles devoted to school nursing practice past, present, and future. This article highlights development of school health programs in the late 1800s to 1950. Since its inception, school nursing service has paralleled events and developments in society. Nursing services were introduced to treat minor illnesses or injuries of children at school, to provide health education to children in school, and to provide follow-up care and teaching in the home setting in order keep the children healthy enough to attend school. As health care moved away from the home into physician-directed hospitals, nursing services in schools shifted from a focus on the public health nurse to the notion of a nurse-teacher with emphasis on health education. By exploring the practice of the early visionaries in school nursing, one realizes that today's nurses have similar challenges and opportunities in providing quality health care to the school community.

V-belts for motor drives in high torque applications were. wearing and failing at an unusually high rate.. The V-belt manufacturer requested recommendations for. process changes which would yield improved wear resistance.. The vulcanized material in the belts consisted of a blend of. two rubbers heavily loaded with carbon black.. Rheological measurements on the uncured constituent rubbers. revealed significant changes in viscoelasticity due to shear. working and gradual incorporation of carbon black reinforcement. during processing.. The impact of these rheological changes on the resulting. blend structure and dispersion of carbon black were. quantified.. This understanding allowed design of a staged addition of. carbon black during compounding which changed the. microsctructure of the composite and significantly. increased wear resistance.

USM professor gets NIH grant

Dr. Shahid Karim, associate professor of biological sciences at Southern Miss, has received a three-year grant from the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to study the disease-transmitting agents present in ticks and other blood-feeding anthropod vectors.

Karim points out that the $439,500 grant will fund research that could one day produce a better awareness of how the vector antioxidant factors can be manipulated to prevent vector-borne diseases. Understanding the interactions between vector and rickettsial agents might help in developing strategies to combat anthropod-borne infections.

Rickettsiosis is a prime example of a vector-borne disease with considerable importance to public health.

Typhus and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever are both diseases with Rickettsiosis characteristics.

This invention relates to new diisocyanates based on diphenylmethane which may be methyl-substituted and which are characterized, in particular, by isocyanate groups in the 3,4'- and, optionally, in the 3,2'-position. The instant invention also relates to a number of processes for their production and to their use as isocyanate component in the production of polyurethane plastics by the isocyanate polyaddition process.
Among the organic polyisocyanates of commercial and economic significance as starting materials for polyurethane plastics, 2,4-diisocyanatotoluene or mixtures thereof with 2,6-diisocyanatotoluene (TDI) and 4,4'-diisocyanatodiphenylmethane or mixtures thereof with 2,2'- or 2,4'-diisocyanatodiphenylmethane and/or with higher homclogs (MDI) are particularly important. Although these aromatic polyisocyanates are universally used in large quantities for the production of polyurethane plastics, particularly foams and elastomers, their use involves certain disadvantages. Thus, TDI, for example, has an increased vapor pressure in comparison with MDI, which means that, for physiological reasons, appropriate safety measures have to be strictly observed in the processing of this raw material. On the other hand, MDI, i.e. in particular, the 4,4'-diisocyanatodiphenylmethane generally present as main component in polyisocyanate mixtures based on diphenylmethane, is a solid at room temperature with a pronounced tendency towards crystallization. Before processing, these raw materials have to be liquified either by heating to a temperature above the melting point of 4,4'-diisocyanatodiphenylmethane or by chemical modification, for example partial urethane formation (U.S. Pat. No. 3,644,457) or partial carbodiimide formation (U.S. Pat. No. 3,152,162).
The present invention provides new aromatic polyisocyanates which combine the advantages of TDI and MDI without having any of their disadvantages. In addition, the new diisocyanates and diisocyanate mixtures, in contrast to 4,4'-diisocyantodiphenylmethane, contain isocyanate groups of different reactivity which is often of advantage in the production of polyurethane plastics. In addition, the use of the new diisocyanates or diisocyanate mixtures according to the invention in the production of polyurethane plastics makes it possible for new rigid segments corresponding to the hydrocarbon skeleton of the diisocyanates to be incorporated into the polyurethane plastics, which provide a new and interesting possibility for variation in the production of polyurethane plastics.

Possibly, but I wouldn't count on it. A huge part of the problem is how compressed the data is; remember that a 360 disc can technically only hold 4.3 gigs of data (same a DVD), and the PC build of Skyrim is about 10 gigs. So even with more console RAM in place there are still likely to be freezes due to the console being unable to properly decode the correct processes within the specified time frame. Most lock-up freezes happen when something within the cell has changed (i.e. an enemy is spawning), or you are moving between cells. A required code string isn't found right away, other code strings continue to load and activate, and then it becomes too late - even when the correct process is found, everything else has skipped ahead too far and now it's out of sync. You can get similar crashes on a PC if you're using a lot of mods which have added all sorts of overlapping code.

Having more RAM in a next gen console will help with retrieval speed and should reduce lock up crashes, but you'll never completely eliminate the time required to decompress the files, so some freezing will still take place.

I started to have freezing issues on load screens after I downloaded the DLC's. I have now been in the practice of clearing the cache out when I load the game. This seems to have cured my freezing problem.

To clear the cache RB + LB + "X" from as soon as I see the Besthada logo until I get the main menu.

A new class of broadband arrays with frequency invariant beam pattern is proposed. By suitable substitutions, the beam pattern of a continuous sensor array can be regarded as the Fourier transform of its spatial and temporal parameters. For the design of practical discrete sensor arrays, it can be regarded as an approximation to the continuous sensor case and a simple design method is provided, which can be applied to linear, rectangular and cubic broadband arrays..

Bhojwani School Awareness Session. Wake up Pune conducted a school awareness session on Wednesday the 22nd of April at Bhojwani school, a private school on the outskirts of Pune. The students of one of the 10th standard classes were continuing their education about the risks and stigma that are associated with sexually transmitted infections especially in regards to HIV/AIDS.. Wake Up Pune was enlisted to help the students gain a deeper understanding of the ‘stigma chakra’ and how the cycle of silence and discrimination can be broken. The students, who had already been introduced to the basics of sex education and sexually transmitted infections, were receptive and interactive – asking questions and joining in with activities...

Q:

Consulta MYSQL con una condicion de varios ids

estoy tratando de entender como podria hacer una condiccion que  a partir de un WHERE me imprima todo menos las publicaciones con los ids que hay en un array llamado $dataP ejemplo:
$dataP=[];//los ids se guardaran aqui

$sql=$con->query("SELECT * FROM nacionales ORDER BY fecha DESC LIMIT 10");

 while($rowP=$sql->fetch_array()){

   array_push($dataP, $rowP['id']);

 }

Mas adelante en mi pagina nececito imprimir unos Posts de la misma tabla donde los ids no sean iguales a los que ya estan en el array, Ejemplo:
$query1=$con->query("SELECT * FROM nacionales ORDER BY fecha DESC WHERE ids no sean iguales a los que estan en el array $dataP");

Como podria hacer esto no tengo ni idea, gracias ojala puedan ayudarme!

A:

Puedes usar NOT IN() de Mysql
// une los Ids del array a un string de ids separados por coma
$ids = implode(",", $dataP);

$query1=$con->query("SELECT * FROM nacionales WHERE id NOT IN($ids) ORDER BY fecha DESC");

There’s a buzz about social media for a reason and 2013 is likely to see a continued increase in the way social channels are used for business purposes. For the more advanced users, we will see an increase in more targeted interactions within niche communities and it will be important to align strategies accordingly.

With the growth in lawyer rating and comparison websites, Legal Futures Associate Jamie Claret asks why law firms are not more concerned about protecting their online reputation. Just because lawyers do not take such sites seriously does not mean the public treats them the same.

SAN DIEGO -- Former California Republican Party Chairman and candidate for Lt Governor Ron Nehring today issued the following statement in response to the release of the UN's IPCC climate change report and California's climate change policies:

"The verdict is in: the Earth’s climate is changing. Although that’s nothing new. When I hike in the California desert and see layers of sedimentary rock thousands of feet above me, it’s a reminder that our geology and climate are changing all the time.

"The more important question for policymakers is how we respond, and here California is on the wrong track. The money California is spending right now dealing with climate change achieves very little. The taxes being paid under AB 32 are not being used to adapt our state to the impact of climate change; they're being used as a slush fund to pay for pet projects like the controversial bullet train. Meanwhile, Californians’ family budgets are being strained further by higher prices for electricity and gasoline, and higher taxes to pay for green energy subsidies.

"The better approach for California is to focus on adaptation with more robust water and irrigation systems, better management of our public lands to reduce wildfire hazards, stronger coastal infrastructure, and a stronger economy. Continuing on our current path only means a poorer state less able to adapt to drought, wildfire, and other impacts of a changing climate.

Yang Tae-young

Yang Tae-Young (, born July 8, 1980, Seoul) is a South Korean 2004 Olympic medalist in artistic gymnastics.

Yang made his World Gymnastics Championships debut in 2001, competing with the eighth-place South Korean team in Ghent. He also participated in the 2003 Worlds in Anaheim, where he helped the Korean squad qualify a full team to the 2004 Olympics with a twelfth-place finish. Yang also competed in the all-around final in Anaheim, placing twelfth. At the 2004 Olympics, Yang contributed to the Korean team's fourth-place finish, placed tenth on high bar, and won a bronze medal in the all-around. He won a bronze medal at the team event in the 2006 Asian Games.

2004 Olympics controversy
Yang is perhaps best known for being one of the athletes involved in a major judging scandal at the 2004 Olympics. In the all-around, Yang finished third, behind his teammate Kim Dae-Eun and American Paul Hamm.

When Yang performed on the parallel bars, one of his elements was mistaken for a simpler skill. Consequently, his routine only received a Start Value of 9.9. The identical routine had received a 10.0 SV in both the team qualifying and team finals sessions at the Olympics. If it had been valued at a 10.0 during the all-around, and the rest of the meet had proceeded the same way, Yang might have finished in first place.

The Korean Olympic Committee, Yang and his coaches filed a protest about the results, and an investigation was opened. After reviewing the situation, International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) officials acknowledged that the SV for the routine had indeed been incorrectly calculated, and suspended the three judges responsible for the error (Oscar Buitrago Reyes of Colombia, Benjamin Bango of Spain, and the head judge George Beckstead of the United States) but ruled that there was no way to change the results after the meet had concluded.

A major point of contention was the time at which the score protest was filed. Under FIG rules, score protests must be filed immediately, during the actual competition, to be considered. The Korean Olympic Committee claimed that one of the judges on the parallel bars panel, Kim Dong Min, noticed that the Start Value was amiss during the competition, informed Yang's coaches directly after the meet, and that a protest was lodged around the time of the medal ceremony. The FIG stated that in fact, no protest had been filed until later in the day, when the athletes were leaving the arena.

Members of the Korean delegation consulted the President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Dr. 
Jacques Rogge. The IOC stated that it would not intervene, and would uphold the FIG's decision, unless there was evidence of deliberate underscoring or other judging impropriety. The possibility of awarding a second gold medal to Yang was discussed, but was not endorsed by Rogge. The United States Olympic Committee also withdrew their support of this idea after FIG President Bruno Grandi suggested that Hamm give his medal to Yang as a gesture of goodwill. The USOC maintained that Hamm had done nothing personally wrong, he had merely competed in the meet, and that he should not be punished for the errors of the gymnastics officials. Furthermore, Grandi's suggestion went against the FIG's official ruling on the case.

On August 28, 2004, Yang and the Korean Olympic Committee filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Arbitrators Michael J. Beloff (United Kingdom), Dirk-Reiner Martens (Germany) and Sharad Rao (Kenya) deliberated over the case for several months, during which time Paul Hamm was called to Lausanne to speak at a hearing. On October 21, 2004, the CAS announced that the case was being dismissed.

The two main reasons given for the dismissal of the case were:

Whether the score protest had occurred according to the KOC or the FIG's version of the events, it had still taken place after the conclusion of the competition, and thus was not valid under FIG rules.
The judging could be considered a "field of play" decision, and could not be rescinded after the fact to change the results.

After the Olympics, the Korean Olympic Committee awarded Yang a symbolic gold medal, expressing their support. They also gave him the same $20,000 prize awarded to gold medalists.

I always enjoy walking to the top of the walking bridge over Aurora Ave. on 41st St. and stopping right at the top of the Fremont-side stairs. You get a great little view of Seattle that includes Lake Union, downtown and the Queen Anne hill.. I imagine, however, it can be a bit of a pain for bicyclists to carry their bike up and down the bridge all the time. And apparently SDOT thought the same thing.. They’ve installed a runnel along the length of the bridge. Basically, a runnel is a track on a staircase that allows you to roll your bicycle with you as you walk up and down. It’s like a little ledge for your wheels to make life just a little easier.. The runnel is installed and now SDOT would like to know how it’s working for everyone. They’re asking for feedback and suggestions to be sent either by phone (206) 684-7583 or email (walkandbike@seattle.gov).. H/T: Bill

A female hostage was shot to death trying to escape from a Moscow theater seized by dozens of gunmen in behalf of Chechen separatism. Despite a massive security perimeter set up outside, the raiders vowed to collapse the building with everyone inside unless Russia withdrew its troops from Chechnya within a week. About 150 hostages were allowed to leave soon after the takeover of the theater during a popular musical Wednesday, but negotiators said they'd been told no more would be freed. President Vladimir Putin canceled his trip to a conference in Mexico on Asian-Pacific economic cooperation to deal with the crisis. Critics said it was a major embarrassment to Putin and pointed up the failure of security forces to anticipate or prevent terrorism.

It was not immediately clear whether the hostage crisis would cause Russia to drop its vocal opposition to the US draft resolution on Iraq, now before the UN Security Council. The Bush administration indicated it wants debate on the measure wrapped up quickly, and diplomats said a vote could come early next week. France, an early opponent, was willing to withhold a veto, reports quoted its own diplomats as saying. China also has veto power, but President Jiang Zemin was expected to be asked on his visit to the Bush ranch in Texas to support  or at least not to block  the resolution.

Only "decisive action to end terror and violence" will bring progress on the creation of a state, special US envoy William Burns told senior Palestinians on Day Two of his new mission to promote a "roadmap" for peace in the Middle East. He said the Palestinian administration also must "reform." The Palestinian delegates to the meeting said they were angry that Yasser Arafat, due to announce his new cabinet choices next week, was not included. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, although yet to meet with Burns, said the plan asks the Jewish state to concede too much with no guarantee the Palestinians would reciprocate.

Despite his late slip in opinion polls, all indications pointed to a landslide victory for leftist candidate Luiz Inacio (Lula) da Silva in Sunday's presidential runoff election in Brazil. Support for the former metal worker dipped two points to 59 percent in the respected Datafolha poll released Wednesday. But backing for his rival, US-educated economist and former Health Minister Jose Serra, also dropped  to 31 percent.

The 2018 Music City Bowl was a college football bowl game played on December 28, 2018 at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee. It was the 21st edition of the Music City Bowl, and one of the 2018–19 bowl games concluding the 2018 FBS football season. Sponsored by the Franklin American Mortgage Company, the game was officially known as the Franklin American Mortgage Music City Bowl. 

The game was projected to be a close game, however Auburn jumped off to an early 21–0 lead. Purdue then put a touchdown on the board to make it 21–7, but Auburn then scored 35 unanswered points to end the half. The halftime score was 56–7, with Auburn setting the NCAA FBS record for points scored in any half of a bowl game. The final score of the game was 63–14.

Formats. Files. Abstract. We review a research methodology used by Joseph Ziegler and Stephen Bell to estimate demand for own-water by industrial firms—Their claim, that the empirical methodology they use provides evidence for the superiority of an average price specification over a marginal price, is rejected. Although we agree that the issue of price,specification for self-supplying firms remains an important issue, we show that it is inconclusively tested by the Ziegler-Bell methodology. We demonstrate that their results are explainable •as direct consequences of specific model restrictions and variable definitions.

How does yoga reduce stress? A systematic review of mechanisms of change and guide to future inquiry.
Yoga is increasingly used in clinical settings for a variety of mental and physical health issues, particularly stress-related illnesses and concerns, and has demonstrated promising efficacy. Yet the ways in which yoga reduces stress remain poorly understood. To examine the empirical evidence regarding the mechanisms through which yoga reduces stress, we conducted a systematic review of the literature, including any yoga intervention that measured stress as a primary dependent variable and tested a mechanism of the relationship with mediation. Our electronic database search yielded 926 abstracts, of which 71 were chosen for further inspection and 5 were selected for the final systematic review. These five studies examined three psychological mechanisms (positive affect, mindfulness and self-compassion) and four biological mechanisms (posterior hypothalamus, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and cortisol). Positive affect, self-compassion, inhibition of the posterior hypothalamus and salivary cortisol were all shown to mediate the relationship between yoga and stress. It is striking that the literature describing potential mechanisms is growing rapidly, yet only seven mechanisms have been empirically examined; more research is necessary. Also, future research ought to include more rigorous methodology, including sufficient power, study randomisation and appropriate control groups.

Caring for patients dying at home from heart failure: a new way of working.
This article explores the difficult journey that heart failure patients frequently experience when trying to access palliative care. It describes how a team of Macmillan and heart failure nurse specialists attempted to address the problem using the specialist role to effect change. Individual and group learning needs were identified and addressed while the use of reflective practice and group working helped the nurses to manage and implement change. This project, with management support, empowered the specialist teams to think creatively about nursing practice and improve patient care. It has encouraged working with clinical nurse specialists from other disciplines, thus avoiding a narrowness of outlook. Although this project initially focused on a small number of patients, it has enabled the teams to become established in partnership working; the collaborative approach to providing palliative care for end-stage cardiac failure patients has since continued to grow and flourish. It is hoped that, in the future, further studies can take place to gain more detailed information from patients and their families about how partnership working can continue to meet the needs of this group.

Should we apologize for what is in our nature? According to Madonna, we shouldn't, and yet perhaps it's society's need to curb the individual that has promoted thousands of years of repression.. The basic thesis of the movie Roshomon, for example, is that everyone lies. We all embellish our presentations to others to place ourselves in the best light. In other words, we attempt to present not our real selves, but our ideals. In truth, however, no one ever lives up to their ideals.. So why do we feel the pressure to be something we're not? Why do we feel the need to pretend, or to apologize for failing to live up to something fake?. The question is, what's wrong with being human? Granted, except for Britney Spears, most people wouldn't turn to Madonna for advice on how to live their lives, but perhaps Madonna actually is a modern-day prophet?. "Dogs never bite me. Just humans." -- Marylin Monroe. What is your definition of what it means to be human?

The North State Symphony was created in 2001 from the merger of the Chico and Redding Symphonies, and functions as a program within the College of Humanities and Fine Arts at California State University, Chico.. The musicians of the orchestra include professionals from a wide geographic area, and community members as well as students and faculty members of California State University, Chico.. The university also provides extensive administrative and production support to the Symphony. Financial support also comes from the community leaders who serve on the Board of Directors, Board of Regents, and members of the music-loving communities of the region. The origins of the North State Symphony can be traced back to 1905, when the first orchestra formed at what was then the Chico State Normal School. Thus 2005 was celebrated as the 100th anniversary of symphonic music in the North State.

When George Bush takes over the presidency, he is likely to inherit a U.S. economy that has been expanding for 74 months, the longest period of peacetime growth during this century.. Yet economists are wondering: Did Ronald Reagan bequeath his vice president a great gift or, rather, a defective piece of merchandise destined to break down with painful consequences for investors and everyone else?. Most experts believe that the post-Reagan era will dawn with continued prosperity for millions of Americans. Yet they worry that the unprecedented national debts piled up in the Reagan years--compounded by an aging recovery--ultimately could force a day of reckoning.. "The Reagan economic legacy isn't all rosy," says Harold C. Nathan, a vice president and senior financial economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "There's a dark side to it, too."

New-onset hypercholesterolemia as an unusual presenting manifestation of eosinophilic gastroenteritis.
We describe an unusual case of new-onset hypercholesterolemia in a 28-year-old man. The presence of low serum albumin and hypercholesterolemia established the suspicion of gastrointestinal disease. Technetium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid scintigraphy was performed to identify possible protein-losing enteropathy. The results were consistent with eosinophilic gastroenteritis, a rare disease characterized by eosinophilic infiltration that may involve several digestive tract layers. To our knowledge, this is the first time that hypercholesterolemia has been recognizing as the presenting manifestation of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. The patient has been successfully treated with prednisone and budesonide. Hypercholesterolemia may be an early manifestation of a serious underlying disease, among which eosinophilic gastroenteritis should also be considered.

Former city official in Pharr gets 22-month sentence in fraud case

U.S. District Court Judge Randy Crane in McAllen this week sentenced former Pharr city commissioner Oscar Elizondo to 22 months in prison for his part in a nearly $1.8 million insurance scheme with an area pharmacy owner.

Omar Espericueta, 46, owner of Riverside Pharmacy in Penitas, just west of McAllen, was to have been sentenced along with Elizondo Wednesday, but his sentencing was reset for sometime in May 2019.

Elizondo, 48, who worked as a marketer for Espericueta, was convicted in November for his part in filing false claims for expensive pain relievers and other drugs with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, as The Texas Monitor reported at the time. Two days later, Espericueta was convicted in the fraud scheme.

As part of a plea agreement Elizondo must reimburse Blue Cross Blue Shield $1,484,268.05.

In court Wednesday, Crane chastised Elizondo for a “blatant fraud,” a “complete ruse” that took advantage of Frontera Produce, Point Isabel Independent School District and the cities of Mission and Pharr, among others that fund their own health insurance programs through Blue Cross Blue Shield, U.S. Atty. Ryan Patrick said in a release.

According to the indictment handed down by a McAllen grand jury in July 2017, Elizondo and Espericueta assembled a group of “marketers” to obtain insurance information from employees of businesses with Blue Cross insurance all over the Rio Grande Valley.

These marketers plied their targets with meals and drinks and promised them expensive prescription pain patches and scar creams in exchange for their information, according to the indictment.

Over five months beginning in late 2015, the conspirators directed these insurance holders to see Dr. Pedro Garcia, with whom they “had made arrangements to sign fraudulent prescriptions in exchange for cash, fake loans and prescription painkillers,” the indictment said.

Sometimes Garcia met with patients in a vacant office arranged by Elizondo and Espericueta. For a while they rented a recreational vehicle and parked it next to a local restaurant, where they recruited policy holders and ushered them into the RV to see the doctor, the indictment said.

And sometimes false prescriptions were drafted without any contact with a doctor, the indictment said.

Garcia, 70, of Mission, pleaded guilty in February 2017 to conspiracy to commit health care fraud before federal District Judge Ricardo Hinojosa, after making a deal with federal authorities for a reduced sentence.

The conspirators submitted hundreds of fraudulent claims to Blue Cross and Blue Shield, filing for multiple refills of prescriptions for which the pharmacy was paid but never delivered, the indictment said.

The Mission Police Department, the fraud unit of the Texas Department of Insurance, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the FBI cooperated in the investigation.

Roman Vlasov Renders A Luxurious, Multitiered Swimming Pool In A Garden Oasis. Ukrainian conceptual architect Roman Vlasov has designed ‘Concept/689’: a speculative swimming pool complex with multiple storeys that is visualized as being built into the layers of the earth.. The striking project juxtaposes the vibrancy of nature with the curving, man-made structure. The layout of the pool is designed to mimic the shape of an eroded geological landmark, revealing multiple levels underneath for leisurely activities. The shapes of the project are reminiscent of Italian Postmodernist design; in particular the curved ‘Ultrafragola’ mirror designed by the late pioneering architect Ettore Sottsass. The smooth white curvatures of the construction stand out against the lush forested site, exposing the point where landscape and architecture meet..

In many applications, relationships among objects of interest are more complex than pairwise. Simply approximating complex relationships as pairwise ones can lead to loss of information. An alternative for these applications is to analyze complex relationships among data directly, without the need to first represent the complex relationships into pairwise ones. A natural way to describe complex relationships is to use hypergraphs. A hypergraph is a graph in which edges can connect more than two vertices. Thus we consider learning from a hypergraph, and develop a general framework which is applicable to classification and clustering for complex relational data. We have applied our framework to real-world web classification problems and obtained encouraging results.

The recently released National Probate Calendar on Ancestry.co.uk has tempted me into ordering copies of four wills, three of which I wouldn’t have even thought about ordering for a long time, the other one I probably would have ordered in the near future.

I don’t think any of these four wills are actually going to solve any particular research problems, but they should hopefully satisfy my curiosity.

John FAIRS (my 3x great-grandfather) of Henfield, Sussex who died in November 1915. John FAIRS was an agricultural labourer and if the cross on his daughter’s wedding certificate is anything to go by he was not well educated. So why was his estate valued at over £982? Where had this wealth come from?

William TROWER (my 4x great-grandfather) of Henfield, Sussex who died in January 1875. William TROWER was a farmer, almost the last of several generations to farm and live at Harwoods Farm in Henfield. I will be interested to see if the TROWER family were still owners of the farm.

Henry HEMSLEY (my 3x great-grandfather) of Blackboys, Sussex who died in January 1914. Henry HEMSLEY was the licensee and owner of the Gun Inn, and the attached farm. This is the will I would probably have ordered quite soon, in the process of trying to find out everything I can about the inn.

Henry WRIGHT (my 3x great-grandfather) of Alton, Hampshire who died in August 1895. Henry WRIGHT was originally known as Henry SHORNDEN and he moved from Kent to Hampshire for some reason, I don’t really expect find answers as to why he changed his named and moved to Kent, but I would like to find out as much as I can about his life.

If nothing else these wills are going to give me plenty of work to do as I process this lot, but it is also going to force me to get my act together when it comes to recording all the details in my database, in fact it might be worth starting now and deciding how all the information should be recorded.

Whilst I am waiting for them to arrive I should probably also write a post on how to order copies of wills, and how easy it is if you live in the UK and have a cheque book, otherwise things start getting a little more difficult.

Our daughter chose to go to public school. Our daughter chose to go to public school for Jr & Sr years. So many stories!. Our meeting with her counselor was a classic I must give full due some day. Best part was my taking our daughter out of the room for a moment, making her ditch the gum (!), and telling her when we went back in, it would be she, not me, sitting across from the counselor. Heh.. When we emerged, daughter had been advanced enough credits to graduate. I mean, real ones. She aced French 5 but had no cred for 1-4. Like that.. After us, they changed the way they dealt with the formerly homeschooled. (Not for the better IMO.). On the DARE test is a question, do you know where to get drugs in school?. Daughter's friend later asks, what did you put?. "No.". Her friend proceeds to name and rate the various dealers in the school.. She did have one good physics course....

In this paper, the application of matching pursuit (MP) in progressive coding of memoryless Gaussian sources is studied. In addition, a detailed analysis of the rate-distortion performance of our proposed MP encoder is presented, and the distortion of the MP encoder is derived in terms of dictionary size and number of quantization levels and the optimum parameters are calculated. Our analysis is based on a probabilistic model for matching pursuit residual vectors. Our simulation results verify the accuracy of our analysis and show that matching pursuit can produce an embedded bitstream with comparable quality to existing quantizers. The MP encoder outperforms quantizers that are capable of producing embedded bitstreams.

Sweet soft whispers. fairytale smile,. Take hold and game play. just for a while,. Hearts. you capture,. Minds. enrapture,. And all the while. its just a game,. Another heart. another name,. The epitome of. the doomsday book,. Look at all the hearts. you’ve took,. And everyone else. yeah their to blame,. For falling for. your sweetest game,. I was writing this to music and letting the music dictate the words but the style of music has changed and I’ve lost the thread as my thoughts change. Ugh…. Attention span of a hyperactive child dosed up on sugar….

Do you know how much I love you?. I wish I could tell you with words. But nothing I say or write. Can paint quite the right picture. So instead I’ll take you into my arms. When you’re tired on a Tuesday evening. I’ll stroke your hair if sleep evades us. And when Sunday rises, softly I’ll wake you. With my lips on your resting forehead. When the words don’t quite fit. I will tell you tell you with every lingering touch. My hand will take yours at any road we cross,. And I will shade your eyes on our long drives, when the sun dips towards the horizon. So when we sit together on slow evenings, I’ll rest my head in the crook of your neck. at home in our peace. A mellow comfortable love.. And if after all this, the words still are not quite right ,. I will know that you know,. and that will be enough. Image provided by the author Eden Cain

Carnival Queen

Carnival Queen, or sometimes Carnaval Queen, is the name or title given to a woman or a girl who is chosen to perform official duties during the celebration of the Carnival, a festive season which occurs immediately before Lent wherein the main events are usually held annually in February. The title is also given to a woman or a girl who has won the beauty and talent competition during the Carnival, or a woman who won a beauty and talent contest and thus become the representative during the celebration of the Carnival. 

One notable place in Spain that elects a new Carnival Queen every year is Santa Cruz de Tenerife. On the other hand, the Carnival in Tarragona - also in Spain - starts with the building of a huge barrel and the later ends with the burning of that barrel together with the burning of the effigies of the Carnival Queen and the Carnival King, a symbolic ritual that signifies bidding "farewell to the flesh" (literally "to remove meat") by men and women - such as from their diet - before the Lenten season, a form of human renewal, because meat or the "flesh" is prohibited during Lent.

#StandWithUkraine. Visitors to this site know that I normally don't get involved with political issues, but this is not normal.. Please help to support Ukraine against the bullying tactics of a huge neighboring country.. by Oliver Even. (Hayward, WI, USA). Hello, I recently bought a "Cacti Mix" pack of seeds and just put them into a 10.5 by 21 inch seed starter pan that's about 2.5 inches deep, it also has a clear lid, I'll leave a photo of one that looks identical.. The lid doesn't clasp shut completely, it just sits, I use them for my other veggies and flowers and it does keep the humidity in.. Anyways, I've seen that you're supposed to put saran wrap over the pot or put the whole pot in a Ziploc, what should I do with what I have mine in? And how/when do you water the seeds if they're supposed to be covered?

During our last week in Hong Kong we got a chance to try the semi-lunch buffet (or perhaps it should be a semi-buffet lunch) at Mr. Steak Grill in Causeway Bay. The first course is the buffet, followed by an entree of your choice. I enjoyed the appetizer so much (endless shrimp cocktail and smoked salmon FTW!!!) that I barely had room left for my steak.. For around HKD$200 (depending on which entree you pick), it’s not your everyday meal if you’re a regular (read: not rich) HK person, but it’s a good bargain once in awhile for the quality and amount of food you get.

East Turkistan National Awakening Movement

The East Turkistan National Awakening Movement (ETNAM)  (Uyghur: شەرقىي تۈركىستان مىللىي ئويغۇنۇش ھەرىكىتى) is a Washington D.C. based non-profit human rights and political rights' group which was established in June 2017. The group supports the East Turkestan independence movement. Salih Hudayar, an Uyghur American consultant and graduate student founded the group after pre-existing Uyghur organizations failed to effectively call for East Turkestan's independence deeming it "controversial".

Advocacy 

According to ETNAM, it seeks to establish unity, democratic values and compassion amongst the people of East Turkistan (known as "Xinjiang" by China) in order to restore the state of East Turkestan in accordance with international laws. It strives to promote the national interest and rights of all the peoples of East Turkistan ("Xinjiang").

ETNAM strongly believes that the East Turkestan National Movement is not exclusive to the Uyghurs but all Turkic peoples of East Turkistan including Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Tatars, and others. The group advocates for "the end of China's colonization and occupation of East Turkistan and actively strives to restore the independence of East Turkestan." ETNAM is the first Uyghur organization to not portray the Uyghur and other Turkic peoples of East Turkistan as a persecuted minority, but rather as an occupied state.

Activities
Since its founding, ETNAM has organized numerous demonstrations calling for the independence of East Turkestan and lobbied members of the US Congress to enact bills to help protect the Uyghur and other Turkic peoples of East Turkistan ("Xinjiang"). On December 20, 2018, in remembrance of the 69th anniversary of China's occupation of East Turkistan, the group organized a march from the White House to the State Department and called on the US government to "recognize the genocide occurring in East Turkistan" and also called on the United Nations to "act according to the UN Genocide Convention and stop the 21st century Holocaust".

The movement's founder Salih Hudayar gave a speech calling on support for restoring East Turkestan's independence at a Committee on the Present Danger: China event on April 9, 2019.

On July 15, 2019, Bill Gertz, the editor for The Washington Free Beacon reported that researchers with the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement, a relatively new Uyghur independence group, discovered the new camps during a nine-month open source intelligence gathering project that utilized commercial satellite images and reports people in the region. They identified at least 124 internment camps, 193 prisons, and 66 bingtuan labor camps along with 37 military facilities in East Turkistan ("Xinjiang").

The group was also the only Uyghur group to sign onto an open letter authored by retired U.S. Navy Captain James E. Fanell, the former director of intelligence and information operations for the U.S. Pacific Fleet, urging President Donald Trump to "stay the course" and continue his policy of being tough on China. The letter was rebutting a previous letter titled "China is Not the Enemy" written in the Washington Post which urged President Donald Trump to cooperate with China.

On October 1, 2019, the 70th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China, ETNAM's founder, Salih Hudayar, joined dozens of Uyghurs, Tibetans, Hong Kongers, Mongolians, and Kazakhs in front of the United Nations in New York City, where he called on the United Nations to recognize China's atrocities against Uyghurs, Tibetans, and others as a genocide and to recognize East Turkistan, Tibet, and South Mongolia as Occupied Territories. On October 11, 2019, ETNAM participated in a joint rally for Hong Kong hosted by the College Democrats and the College Republicans of the Catholic University of America where Salih Hudayar joined former former Senior Director for Strategic Planning at the White House, Brigadier General Robert Spalding in calling for support for Hong Kong.

On November 12, 2019, the 86th & 75th Anniversary of the East Turkistan Republics, ETNAM held a press conference where they released the coordinates of 182 suspected concentration camps, along with producing a map of East Turkistan containing 209 points labeled prisons, and 74 points labeled labor camps. ETNAM stated it would release further coordinates of prisons and labor camps in coming weeks. After the press conference, ETNAM also held a joint demonstration with the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile in front of the US Capitol, where they called on the US Congress to pass the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act and to recognize East Turkistan as an Occupied Territory. ETNAM has made the satellite imagery data publicly available on their website.

Q:

how to use rvest to scrap same kind of datapoint but labelled with different id

if I want to use rvest to scrap a particular datapoint (name, address, phone etc) repeated in different section of this page, all start with similar span id, but not exactly the same, such as:
docs-internal-guid-049ac94a-f34e-5729-b053-30567fdf050a
docs-internal-guid-765e48e9-f34b-7c88-5d95-042a93fcfda3

what's the best approach? to find and copy each id is not viable. Thanks

A:

Edit:
You can use the following script to retrieve all star restaurants:
library("rvest")

url_base <- "http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/food/full-list-of-michelin-starred-restaurants-for-2017"
data <- read_html(url_base) %>%
   html_nodes("h3") %>%
   html_text()

This also gives you the headers ("ONE MICHELIN STAR", "TWO MICHELIN STARS", "THREE MICHELIN STARS"), bu this might even be helpful.
Background to the script:
Fortunately, all and only the relevant information is within the h3 selector. The script gives you a char vector as output. Of course, you can further elaborate on this with e.g. %>% as.data.frame() or however you want to store / process the data.
------------------- old answer -------------------
Could you maybe provide the url of that particular page? For me it sounds like you have to find the right css-selector (nth-child(x)) you can use in a loop.



Cancer Prevention. A Answers (3). Some risk factors for cancer are modifiable, meaning they are things you can change. Modifiable risks for cancer include smoking and using tobacco products, being obese or overweight, not eating a healthy diet or using a tanning bed.. Some risk factors for cancer you cannot change, such as your family history; these are called unmodifiable risk factors. Some risk factors increase the likelihood of one type of cancer, while others can increase the risk of several types. A program like Oncolink’s “What’s My Risk” is designed to identify your personal risk factors, both modifiable and unmodifiable, and help you focus on those you can change, providing resources and tips to make those changes.

Snow and ice can create hazardous conditions on roads, sidewalks, parking lots, wherever there is either vehicular traffic or pedestrian traffic. It is most desirable that snow and ice control compositions meet certain criteria among which are: (1) efficiency of snow and ice control; (2) it is desirable that the snow and ice control composition is non-corrosive to metals; (3) the material should not cause any deleterious effects on road surfaces; (4) it is relatively innocuous and does no harm to the environment; (5) that it does no damage to plant, animal, or human life.
Prior art is replete with the use of sand or cinders to obtain traction, that is, to provide a gritty surface thus allowing vehicles and pedestrians to obtain traction, additionally, sodium chloride or calcium chloride pellets may be employed to melt the ice and snow; combinations of the two have also be used. In recent years attempts have been made to provide snow and ice control compositions which contain corrosion inhibiters to help prevent corrosion of metals. U.S. Pat. No. 3,630,913 teaches the use of a fluid deicer composition containing urea, ammonium nitrate, ethylene glycol, water and chromate salts to provide non-corrosiveness of both ferrous and non-ferrous materials. The use of heavy metal salts to provide non-corrosive properties is counterproductive since these materials are toxic both to humans and in large quantities to animal and plant life. Another snow and ice control composition is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 3,928,221 which contains a mixture of urea, ethylene glycol, and methanol. A more recent U.S. Pat. No. 4,108,669 teaches that a satisfactory snow and ice control composition can be prepared by the addition of 1-20% by weight of ammonium nitrate by applying an aqueous solution of ammonium nitrate onto calcined montmorillonite.
Older patent references include U.S. Pat. No. 2,308,289 which teaches the use of sand containing sodium chloride. Similarily U.S. Pat. No. 2,410,910 teaches the same use of sodium chloride being contained within cinder particles. Several foreign patents, specifically Ger. Pat. No. 1,459,684 teaches the use of treating pumice, a natural porous volcanic rock treated with urea. Other combinations are found in subsequent foreign patents. For example Ger. Pat. No. 2,148,505 teaches the use of glycol or some other similar polyhydroxy compounds adsorbed onto mineral wool, sand or gravel while Ger. Pat. No. 2,517,618 teaches the addition of adding carbon soot to salt.
Despite this voluminous number of patent citations the fact remains that all of the prior art have very serious limitations. These limitations include, poor leachability of a solute from a particle; poor crush resistant properties, so as to minimize traction; environmentally unsound snow and ice compositions causing serious damage to roads and causing irreversible environmental damage; or being inneffective in lowering the melting point to cause the snow and ice to change from a solid to a liquid state.

Terror and Consent The Wars for the Twenty-First Century By Philip Bobbitt 672 pages. $35, Alfred A. Knopf; £25, Allen Lane., he divides his time among Austin, Texas;. "Terror and Consent" is quite simply the most profound book to have been written on the subject of American foreign policy since the attacks of 9/11 - indeed, since the end of the Cold War. It should be read by all three of the remaining candidates to succeed George W. Bush as American president. 3 Page Article Here. A globalists vision of the near future. Hold onto your socks!. Seems to be a universal problem among the elite, how to overcome democratic instincts. Zbigniew Brzezinski talks about this in "The Grand Chessboard", and the PNACER's talk about it in "Rebuilding America's Defenses. The answer seems simple enough. Another 9/11 or "Pearl Harbor" type event and the people will go along with anything the state demands democratic or not. I'm surprised the obvious answer to this "problem" has eluded these gigantic minds for so long now.

What?. A film that presents and highlights certain ideas revolving the themes of existentialism, relationships, and emotion. I must develop a narrative that highlights key ideas and points within the audience. I want the audience to be lead into a space where they can question certain ideologies.. Why?. Questioning the basic fundamentals we have as individuals and as a piece of a society can be an intimidating task. For the past year I have been dealing with an internal struggle that revolved around what I "knew to be" and if it was okay to question certain things. I want to share my curiousity and passion for accepting that there doesn't always need to be answers for our deepest questions. I find interest in examining existentialism, relationships, and emotion. Through an experimental film I hope to drive the viewer into sharing my curiousity in picking apart certain views.. How?

Neutron tomography developments and applications.
Neutron radiography has been in use as a nondestructive testing technique for the past 50 years. The neutrons' unique ability to image certain elements and isotopes that are either completely undetectable or poorly detected by other NDI methods makes neutron radiography an important tool for the NDI community. Neutron radiography like other imaging techniques takes a number of different forms (i.e., film, radioscopic, transfer methods, tomography, etc.) This paper will describe the neutron tomography system developed at the University of California, Davis McClellan Nuclear Radiation Center (UC Davis/MNRC), and the applications for both research and commercial uses. The neutron radiography system at the UC Davis/MNRC has been under development for 4 years. The initial system was developed to find very low concentrations of hydrogen (i.e., <200 ppm). In order to achieve these low detection levels, it was necessary to perform both pre- and post-processing of the tomographs. The pre-processing steps include corrections for spatial resolution and random noise effects. Images are corrected for systematic noise errors and beam hardening. From these data the attenuation coefficient is calculated. The post-processing steps include alignment of the collected images, determining the center of mass, and, finally, using the filtered back-projection routine from the Donner Algorithms Library to obtain the final images. Since its initial development, the tomography system has been used very successfully to find low levels of hydrogen in a metal matrix. Further uses of the system have been to verify the exact placement, in three dimensions, of "O-rings" in large metal valve bodies, and to map the location and extent of veins in porous and high-density rocks of various different kinds. These examples show that neutron tomography is becoming a needed inspection technique for the 21st century.

LA VERGNE, Tenn. (WKRN) — The city of La Vergne was named the hardest working city in Tennessee, according to a new study released from Zippia.. The study ranked a little less than 4,000 cities. The average was calculated based on:. - Average hours worked. - Average commute time. - Workers per household. - Labor force participation rate. In a release to the media, the study states that using the average of hours worked and commuted gave a better picture of how much time was spent ‘making a living’.. All of the date was collected as part of the most recent ACS Census survey.. La Vergne residents reported an average of 42 hours worked every week, and an average commute of about 16 minutes.. Sudley, Virginia was the hardest working city in the United States followed by Forney, Texas and College Park, Maryland.

Exhibition. ~ An exploration of decay and renewal. ~. A myriad of crises are converging for which humans are responsible. The very biosphere that sustains all life is being pushed to the brink of collapse. Our anthropocentric worldview reinforces a paradigm of unfettered growth, indignant competition and limitless waste.. Nature has limits and we’ve run up against them.. Surrounded by this intensifying decay, an ever-present teacher is there to guide us toward renewal, should we care to pay attention.. Highly textural and at times daunting, the sense of renewal appears insignificant. Much like our present situation, the fact that is there at all should provide hope and learning for us to create a better future.. This exhibit appeared as part of the ReFrame International Film Festival in Ontario this past January.. These photos were taken in various locations throughout Cuba, Ukraine and the US. They are printed on Hahnemühle Fine Art Rag at about 36" x 24" and hung raw using 1930's Esterbrook industrial clips..

Tis the season for eating locally! Last night I had Bengineer over for dinner. Apart from the broiled fish I served, which was decidedly not local, here was our menu:. sliced tomatoes with goat cheese and basil. corn on the cob. roasted green beans with thyme. homemade zucchini bread. Very organic, very local. The tomatoes and goat cheese came from our local farmers' market (my own tomatoes aren't ripe yet). The basil came from my garden. And the corn, beans, and zucchini came from the thriving garden of G&J, who like nothing better than to stuff my car with fresh produce when I go down to their beautiful place for a visit.. Yum.

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — State and federal authorities report settling claims against Long Island-based radiologists for $15.5 million for billing Medicaid and Medicare for diagnostic scans investigators say were not ordered by a treating physician, not medically necessary or not performed.. The civil settlement with Doshi Diagnostic Imaging Services and Diagnostic Imaging Group in Hicksville resolves allegations the practice with 21 locations in New York City and Nassau County submitted false claims between 1999 and 2010.. Under the agreement, New York will get $2.9 million back for the state Medicaid program, $12.4 million will go to the federal Medicare program and $190,000 will go to New Jersey Medicaid.. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman says whistleblower lawsuits led to the signed settlement.. A call to Doshi’s attorney was not immediately returned.

ARARAT - An elderly Ararat man missing for almost 18 hours has been found.. Eighty-two year old Charles Barnes was discovered by a truck driver on the Western Highway on Wednesday morning.. The truck driver picked up Mr Barnes and conveyed him to St Arnaud Police Station before he was transferred to St Arnaud hospital.. Police appealed for public help to locate Mr Barnes after he was last seen driving along the Glenelg Highway in his 1996 silver Ford Falcon at about 3.15pm Tuesday.. Police were told he was heading east on the highway towards Skipton.. Police and family were concerned for his welfare as he suffers from a medical condition which requires medication.

Toronto city councillor, Howard Moscoe has done a complete about turn from his former support for landlord licensing (as weakened as his version was) in favor of an even weaker auditing plan put forth by head of the City’s Municipal Licensing and Standards Department, Jim Hart.. The new auditing plan will be the only fleshed-out proposal to go before the Mayor’s Executive Committee for a vote on Monday, November 10th and if passed, as is likely with no other real proposals on the table, would take effect on Dec. 1st.. According to The Toronto Sun, the auditing scheme would be ‘operated by a team of 12 MLS officers with a background in building audits — will proactively inspect 176 rental (private and social housing) buildings (more…)

2015 was filled with travel, running, and of course, the Big Move from one part of the city to another.... Remodeling. More Moving Stuff.. House Hunters: Salt Lake City (or not). When I sat down and thought about it, I realized that I don't have a deep need to buy a crummy house in a perfect neighborhood just to spend every cent we have and twenty years or more making it into something stripped of horrible floor plans or ill-advised 90s renovations. I may be handy but I don't relish the thought of pulling up linoleum and carpeting or coercing family members to come help tile our bathroom just to save a few hundred bucks just so I can blog about it with pretty "after" pictures.

Type of Sprinkler System. Wet. Wet valve sprinkler systems are permanently charged with water and used to protect premises where temperatures are unlikely to fall below freezing point. They are designed to actuate operate electric, and/or hydraulic alarms when there is a steady flow of water into the system that is equivalent to the discharge rate of one or more sprinklers. The size of the valve, its flow rate and the system water supply pressure and air pressure are all determined by the size and type of fire risk involved. Dry. Dry valve sprinkler systems are permanently charged with air and used to protect unheated premises such as warehouses, hangars, attic spaces and other areas exposed to freezing temperatures. When the system is set is charged with air, the minimum air pressure includes a safety factor to prevent potential main water pressure in stabilities from forcing the Dry valve clack open to allow water into the system pipework.

Modulation of innate and adaptive immunity by P2X ion channels.
Extracellular ATP is a major component of the inflammatory microenvironment where it accumulates following cell and tissue injury but also as a consequence of non-lytic release from activated inflammatory cells. In the inflammatory microenvironment ATP binds and activates nucleotide receptors of the P2Y and P2X subfamilies expressed by immune cells. P2Y receptors are G-protein-coupled, while P2X receptors are cation-selective channels. Changes in the intracellular ion homeostasis triggered by P2X receptor stimulation trigger multiple key responses crucial for initiation, propagation, and resolution of inflammation. In the P2X receptor family, the P2X7 subtype has an important role in the activation of lymphocyte, granulocyte, macrophage and dendritic cell responses. Although clinical studies have been so far rather inconclusive, it is believed that P2X7 receptor targeting might offer novel perspectives for anti-inflammatory therapy.

The primary aim of the proposed work is to develop microelectrodes for determining ifnasal membrane cholesterol is elevated in human cystic fibrosis. Studies will calibratethe electrodes through solution experiments and validate this calibration using a newproposed influx titration assay where the electrode is used as an indicator of influx.Human studies using the electrodes will involve single cell studies on epithelial cellsfrom nasal scrapes. In vivo electrode measurements in the human nose are alsoproposed. In developing the measurements as a diagnostic tool, implementation of invitro measurements at cells and mouse tissues is proposed to establish the relationshipbetween CFTR function and plasma membrane cholesterol content.. Microelectrodes are used to measurer cholesterol efflux from cells andtissues. In vivo experiments are proposed in the human nose to test thehypothesis that cholesterol efflux rate can be used as a diagnostic tool in thestudy of human cystic fibrosis.

In September, on a voice vote without hearings, the House of Representatives approved the Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006, which encourages schools to conduct broad searches on slight pretexts. The bill, which has been referred to a Senate committee, threatens to withhold federal funds from districts that do not allow searches .”. An earlier version of the bill, which used the weaker standard of “colorable suspicion,” said the aim was to protect schools and teachers from lawsuits charging violations of students’ Fourth Amendment rights by clarifying what constitutes a “reasonable” search in this context. But requiring schools with relatively strict search policies to loosen them is a recipe for more litigation, as courts grapple with questions such as whether a school-wide strip search is justified by a whiff of marijuana or by one student’s suspiciously red eyes.

Successful Club Rush Brings New Energy to Student Body. (Scroll for more photos) Campus life was in full force on January 27 when Club Rush took over the Student Services Building with tables lining both sides of the hallway representing 15 of Merritt’s student clubs – some existing and some new – and two community organizations. More than 300 students attended the successful event which was organized by the ASMC and the Inter-Club Council (ICC). In addition to getting information about the clubs, students were treated to sandwiches, fruit, and cookies if they visited at least three tables—a great incentive! Thanks to My Williams and Drew Beesley, ICC co-chairs, for all their hard work in coordinating this event, and to Dr. Lilia Chavez, Director of Student Activities and Campus Life, for her dedication in bringing new energy and commitment to the student body.

Heavy Casualties. The wind storm of 1/17 - 1/18 did some heavy damage out here. The good news is that I didn't see any damaged features, and the trail bed is in good shape (actually, the muddiest/worst I've seen since I started riding out here last fall, but that's not saying too much given this area is pretty good in winter). But a lot of blowdown on the trails and on the roads. Some of it is going to require a lot of work to clear. Rode Elevator, Cyclops, YGD, Sick and Twisted, and No Road. Blowdown on all of them (though much of it can be disposed of with hand saws).

Log Cleanup and Rotation. The required retention period for log files varies from organization to organization. The log files are invaluable as security audit trails and system administration history logs.. The event log grows in length and contains more data than you see when executing a simple pblog command. Execute pblog -l and you will see a list of the variables. We suggest you run a nightly Unix/Linux cron (or similar) job to rename the event log.. mv pb.eventlog pb.eventlog.prev. or. mv pb.eventlog pb.eventlog(datestamp). The I/O log files increase in number rather than length. Their number should also be controlled using Unix/Linux cron. For example, you might want to keep two weeks of I/O logs before removing them from the system.

I have decided that my most popular blog post, 72 Views of the Tower of Babel, has far outgrown itself (well over a hundred and twenty images at last count), and in order to make the views of the Tower of Babel easier for me to manage, as well as hopefully more accessible to visitors, I am restricting the original page to medieval views, and putting post-medieval views on this page, and starting a new page for modern views.. I have also increased the size of the link images from thumbnail size to a maximum dimension of 360 pixels, which I think is a great improvement.. Paintings. Engravings and Prints.

Author & historian Bill Howard will discuss his new book, "The Battle of Ball's Bluff.". Three months after the Civil War's first important battle at Manassas in 1861, Union and Confederate armies met again near the sleepy town of Leesburg. What began as a simple scouting mission evolved into a full-scale battle when a regiment of Union soldiers unexpectedly encountered a detachment of Confederate cavalry. The Confederates pushed forward and scattered the Union line. Soldiers drowned trying to escape back to Union lines on the other side of the Potomac River. A congressional investigation of the battle had long-lasting effects on the war's political and military administration. Bill Howard narrates the history of the battle as well as its thorny aftermath.. The author is generously raffling off two Northshire gift cards to event attendees.

From the low on June 4 to the high of a couple of weeks ago, the market had jumped 29.56 per cent and clearly a lot of people are now thinking that enough is enough.

Volatility is up, the S&P ASX 200 Index has moved more than 50 points eight times in 25 days and has crossed the 5000-point level seven times. A sure sign of a herd that has had its run and is now pawing the ground, wondering where to charge next.

And while it makes its mind up, I and every other commentator are talking and writing endlessly about ''the market''.

In the past month we have all rather laughably become experts on Cyprus, making one profound declaration after another from a position of no insight or knowledge beyond what everyone else has read. Regurgitating what's just happened and why and icing it with a bit of harmless commentary and utter guesswork about what's going to happen next.

The market debate absorbs untold hours of financial effort. The newspapers are full of it, the TV commentators obsessed with it, the economists talk about nothing else and even I find myself obliged by my members to constantly refer to ''The Market'' and what is going to happen to it next.

When investment boils down to what stocks you hold when and whether they are going up or down you have to ask, are we all wasting our time taking about the market?

Really. If all the kings and queens, presidents and heads of state, the central banks, banks, investment banks, regulators, CEOs, brokers, fund managers, financial planners, accountants, investors and even the taxi drivers didn't know there was going to be a global financial crisis, then what hope have you or I of making an accurate call on what happens next?

Yet this is what the market debate implies, that we are building up to some big decision to either buy or sell the market.

But let's be realistic, making that ''big call'' is almost impossible for the average investor. Are you really going to make a decision to sell all your stocks at once or to invest all your cash at once. It'll never happen. The magnitude of the decision means it never gets made because its too onerous, its too big a decision; and because of that, despite endless hours of high brow about the market, most investors are constipated by inaction, or, more likely, acting far too late, like selling in the depths of the GFC or buying on the all-time high.

Sorry, but anyone who allows themselves to be distracted by a potentially valueless macro debate hasn't really worked out what making money from the stockmarket is all about. It's about the stock codes on that spreadsheet, the number of shares, the current price, their current worth and that number at the bottom that adds them all up and tells you what you're worth. The market is bunkum unless you actually trade the index, which few people do. In which case your time will be far better spent dealing with ''stocks'', with the stocks that you hold, and through that you'll find the market calls are made for you.

By listening to the charts on individual stocks, selling individual stocks as their up trends end, or buying individual stocks as their down trends reverse, you are incrementally going to make a call on ''the market'' without having to. You don't have to make a ''big call''; it is made for you. And by the time you hear about a market correction on CNBC, a correction which leaves all the ''moron portfolio'' investors in a cold sweat about whether they've left it too late to sell, you will have sold everything already.

Turns out that the way to time the market is not to try to time ''the market'' but to try to time individual stocks and, in so doing, ''the market''; then your portfolio timing will take care of itself.

It's a heck of a lot easier to break the big decisions down into a lot of little ones.

The postdoctoral Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Training Program at the University of Michigan is designed to recruit and provide high quality research training in one of two major tracks, Basic Science or Clinical Investigation &Epidemiology to qualified candidates. The theme of the Program is developmental programming of endocrine disorders. The program is organized to complement the established training program in clinical pediatric endocrinology for M.D.s, and for basic scientist pursuing a career in endocrine research, by providing 2 years of intensive postdoctoral training using closely-mentored research training program individialy structured for each trainee. The program is actively supported by 19 faculty from 12 different departments, all of whom have extensive research and mentoring experience. The Program also includes an extensive didactic component tailored to each trainee's educational background and research interests. Trainees in the Basic Sciences complete a 3-month course designed to expose them to a variety of state-of-the-art techniques, as well as to skills in performing hypothesis-driven, controlled research studies. Trainees in the Clinical Investigation &Epidemiology choose between Outcomes &Epidemiology or Clinical Research. They complete courses leading to either a Master of Public Health in Biostatistics &Epidemiology or a Master of Science in Clinical Research Design &Statistical Analysis. In addition to the formal curriculum, trainees attend weekly clinical and research seminars. Mentored research is supported the Medical School resourses including the Centers of Integrative Genomics, Proteomics, Organogenesis and Diabetes and the Center for Advancement of Clinical Research. To optimize each trainee's potential for development of a successful academic career, trainees are required to submit abstracts to national meetings, submit a first-authored research manuscript, and apply for individual grant funding. Expansion of our Program will help alleviate the critical shortage of successful Pediatric Endocrinologists and Pediatric Physician-Scientists

The winners of the European Search Awards were unveiled last night to a packed room at the Hilton in Berlin, Germany. We sent an OMD UK delegation there to find out if they were the best-of-the-best in pan-European SEO, PPC and Content Marketing…and it was a magical night.. We were delighted to win two awards, beating stiff competition from across the continent. Our work with Royal Caribbean, where we took Google Street View to a cruise ship for the first time, won in two categories: Best SEO Campaign and Innovation – Campaign.. It was an amazing night and one the team won’t forget for a long time. Having recently won four awards at the Travel Marketing Awards 2015 and being shortlisted for countless more awards, it’s fair to say this ground-breaking campaign has caught the imagination of people worldwide.

Sept. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Gary Cohn’s hand surgeon will
operate for another year, Vikram Pandit will help disadvantaged
children save for college and George Soros is sending aid to
threatened scholars.

Financial-industry executives are set to take leading roles
in New York’s nonprofit gala season.

“When people like Vikram step up and say, ‘I believe in
this organization, here’s what I’ve been doing,’ that’s gold for
us,” said Richard Buery, chief executive officer of the
Children’s Aid Society.

Pandit, CEO of Citigroup Inc., will be honored at the
society’s “Keeping the Promise” gala on Nov. 29 at 583 Park,
which has a $1,000 ticket. The spotlight will be on Citigroup’s
creation of a college savings program for grade-school children.
Citigroup has donated $2 million to the society over two
decades, Buery said.

George Soros kicks off the latest round of parties tomorrow
at Cipriani Wall Street, where the Institute for International
Education is honoring him as a founder of its Scholar Rescue
Fund. In 10 years the fund has given $16.5 million to 465
threatened scholars in 48 countries. The gala has a $1,250
ticket.

The same night at Cipriani 42nd Street, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. Vice Chairman J. Michael Evans will join model Selita
Ebanks and actress Jemima Kirke of HBO’s “Girls” on behalf of
New Yorkers for Children. Evans is a chairman of the event,
which raises funds to support teenagers in the foster system as
they make the transition to adulthood. A path of lanterns will
express the “Light the Way” theme.

Gary Cohn

On Sept. 24, Goldman President and COO Gary Cohn will be
the chairman for the third year in a row of the New York
University Hospital for Joint Diseases and Center for
Musculoskeletal Care Gala. Cohn was a patient at the hospital
when he twisted his thumb while skiing. He’ll join honoree Jes
Staley, chairman of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s corporate and
investment bank, under the blue whale at the American Museum of
Natural History.

Responsibilities of honorees and chairmen vary. Almost
always, they are expected to call on friends and customers to
buy tickets. And they lend their names to invitation marquees.

“When you have the right kind of committee chairs and
honorees, there’s a magnetism that attracts people,” said
Timothy Seiler, director of the Fund Raising School at the
Center for Philanthropy at Indiana University. “People say, I
want to work with that group or socialize with that group.”

John Paulson

And so the list goes on. On Nov. 5, John Paulson will help
New Yorkers connect to books and job resources as a first-time
chairman of the Library Lions gala at the New York Public
Library. He and other chairmen, including Blackstone Group’s
Steve Schwarzman, will greet guests on a receiving line in Astor
Hall.

The night after the presidential election, Apollo Global
Management’s Leon Black is a chairman, KKR & Co.’s Henry Kravis
a grandparent chairman, and industrialist David Koch the
underwriter of the $500-a-ticket Rockefeller University Parents
& Science Benefit Dinner.

The proceeds of the Nov. 7 event held on Rockefeller’s
Upper East Side campus will support the development of a Center
for Research on Child and Adolescent Health. An alumnus of the
university, Robert Lustig, will give a lecture titled “Darwin,
Diet, Disease and Dollars: How the Sugar in Processed Foods
Changed Society.”

Lia Neal

Financial executives and academics aren’t the only life of
the party. Olympic bronze medalist Lia Neal is the guest of
honor at a reception for Asphalt Green, where she trained, on
Sept. 19. On Oct. 22, Right to Play’s Red Ball Gala is expected
to draw Olympic gold medalists Joey Cheek, Allyson Felix, Picabo
Street as well as Goldman’s Evans, who won gold when he rowed
crew for Canada.

“My wife and I got involved because the organizing premise
-- that structured sport and play can be a powerful tool for
individual development -- resonates with the experiences that
shaped our upbringing,” said Evans, U.S. board chairman of
Right to Play.

These athletes and everyone else will get healthy fare,
said Liz Neumark, founder of Great Performances, which caters
150 fundraisers a year. Tomato-water shooters and farro instead
of mashed potatoes can be expected, Neumark said.

For those not into a night of black tie and ballroom, the
Global Poverty Project is organizing a Sept. 29 concert in
Central Park featuring Neil Young, the Black Keys and K’naan,
Robert Pattinson’s beloved rapper in the movie “Cosmopolis.”
Tonight is the deadline to enter a lottery for almost 60,000
free tickets, which requires recording action taken to fight
poverty. Ultimate Global VIP tickets are available for $689.50.

At the People’s Summit for a Global Pact of Solidarity with Migrants and Refugees, held in Marrakech December 8th and 9th of 2018, hosted by La Via Campesina and its member organisations of the Middle East and North Africa (MeNa) Process, the global peasant movement and its allies have issued a scathing critique of the Global Compact on Migration and rejected it.

WE WEREN’T expecting much, as the ministers had been peppering the media for two days...and we were indeed not disappointed. However, Macron’s speech tonight revealed the nature of his policy, even as it falters against the movement of “yellow vests.”

Faced with the mobilisation of the yellow jackets, the government began to retreat, announcing the abolition, for the year 2019, of the increase in fuel taxes. The government, which was showing its "inflexibility" just a few days ago, is panicking and trying to put out the fire it started itself.

The call for donations we launched has been a success. Several thousand euros have been donated. In addition, we have received a commitment to donate a considerable amount of labour to finish the translation whch is now moving ahead rapidly. With these donations, the IIRE and Resistance Books can now plan the publication of the book in mid-2019.

Should a woman tending to personal care needs of an elderly person be paid more or less than a male garbage disposal worker? The government’s decision to support a pay rise for 150,000 social and community services workers delivers a well-earned boost to the pay packets of some of our most under-appreciated workers. But Fair Work Australia’s new powers to assess pay discrimination cases based on “equal or comparable work” open a can of worms.

What constitutes comparable work? Traditional economics struggles to explain the continuing gender pay gap, in large part because of the concentration of women in non-market, public-sector jobs where pay is set by decree, rather than by the forces of supply and demand. The historic undervaluation of “women’s work” – the caring responsibilities once carried out for free in the home – continues to dog women’s pay.

Men working in private-sector waste management, for example, traditionally demand and receive “compensatory pay” – extra for the unpleasantness of the job. But when women care for the elderly, handle bed pans and change soiled sheets, society says they should do it as a labour of love and respect.

Women continue to earn just 82 per cent of their male counterparts working in full-time jobs. Much of this gap – about 8 percentage points – is due to a combination of factors, including that men tend to work in higher-status jobs and work longer hours in them.

A better measure of the pay gap – that of full-time, adult, ordinary time, non-managerial, average cash earnings – puts it at a somewhat narrower 90 per cent. But how do we explain the remaining 10 percentage point gap?

Much of this is due to the different industries in which men and women work, their individual willingness to negotiate pay rises, the interrupted career paths of women as they have children, and outright discrimination.

Standard economic theory also struggles with the concept of discrimination. A firm that excluded women on the basis of sex, rather than productivity, would reduce the size of its potential labour pool by half. As a result, it would have to pay more for its male workers. Female workers – less in demand – could only sell their labour for a lower price. A firm that seized the opportunity to hire cheaper, but similarly productive, female workers would soon get a profit advantage over its discriminating rivals.

And yet, discrimination exists. Some economists say employers discriminate against women to appeal to the innate sex preferences of customers. Families would rather have a male financial adviser, or a male barrister in court. Hmm. Maybe.

A fascinating piece of research highlighting the importance of discrimination in pay setting came across my Twitter feed this week. Like Daughter, Like Father: How Women’s Wages Change When CEOs Have Daughters reflects on data from 6321 Danish firms which found male CEOs with daughters closed the workforce earnings gap by 0.5 per cent in the year after a daughter’s birth. If she was also their first born, the gap narrowed by 2.8 per cent.

The researchers said: “The first daughter ‘flips a switch’ in the mind of a male CEO, causing him to attend more to equity in gender-related wage policies.” The effect was strongest for highly educated employees – suggesting CEOs relate more to their highly educated female employees – and in firms with a smaller number of employees – where the CEO would have greater power over wage setting.

Until we begin to truly tackle society’s deep-seated attitudes towards women in work, closing the gender pay gap will remain a work in progress.

Post-traumatic respiratory distress syndrome.
During the past two decades there has been recognition of the role of acute respiratory failure in the deaths of patients with shock from any cause. Leaky capillaries are the common pathophysiologic event. The pulmonary capillary bed is affected by the toxic action of vasoactive substances, gastric aspirates, and fat embolism; by the obstructive action of platelet, fibrin, and leukocyte clots; and by changes in the balance between perfusion pressures and oncotic pressures. This is complicated by increases in pulmonary vascular pressures from associated heart disease or overenthusiastic replacement of blood volume. The early treatment of the shock state, early intubation and ventilation, and the use of agents designed to improve capillary integrity have led to a significant reduction in mortality from this common problem.

Mike Singletary was one of 13 candidates the Chicago Bears didn't hire during their marathon head-coaching search. He's not ready to give up his quest to move back up the NFL personnel ladder.. Singletary -- currently the Minnesota Vikings' linebackers coach -- met with the St. Louis Rams about their vacant defensive coordinator position, according to Jeremy Fowler of CBSSports.com.. Prior to joining the Vikings last season, Singletary spent three seasons as head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. He was fired late in 2010 and replaced by Jim Harbaugh, who's led the Niners to the NFC Championship Game and the Super Bowl in back-to-back years.. Singletary was a Hall of Fame linebacker with the Bears, but has never been a defensive coordinator in the NFL. His Q rating took a hit during the end of his run in San Francisco, but catching on with the Rams would certainly send his career back in the right direction..

Q:

Using Mailman, how to unshunt message back into hold queue for moderation?

How can I get Mailman to reprocess messages in a queue directory? Or alternately, how can I transfer all the messages from a queue directory into the moderation hold queue for the relevant list(s)?

My problem is that my in queue directory is full of messages that previously passed moderation, but were never delivered because my qrunner wasn't working. I know that I could just start up the qrunner and those messages would get delivered, but I want list administrators to have a second look because some of the messages are fairly old, and it wouldn't make sense to send them now.
I read about a Mailman command called unshunt but I don't think it does quite what I need here.

A:

I found a way to get Mailman to reprocess messages as if they were fresh. First I used show_qfiles to extract the raw message content from a .pck file, then I pass that content to the Mailman wrapper.
PATH="$PATH:/usr/lib/mailman/bin:/usr/lib/mailman/mail"
show_qfiles -q /PATH/TO/YOURFILE.PCK | sudo -u postfix mailman post LISTNAME

The sudo is required because the Mailman wrapper must be run with a low privileged user like Postfix.
The verb post instructs the wrapper to process the message like any other incoming message.
This doesn't guarantee a message will be held for moderation, it just means the same criteria will be applied as if a new message was sent to the list.

What.. A standard reach-in closet is designed to store shirts, slacks and dresses. These items generally fit on their hangers within the recommended 24 inches of depth used in many closets. A coat closet typically has a depth of 28 inches, which allows enough extra room to accommodate bulky coats and their hangers. Linen closets, filled with shelving, are generally have a depth of 16 inches.. As homes grow larger, closets grow also. It is not unusual to find double-length closets that have two doors at the entrance. Walk-in closets have no standard dimensions, but they instead tend to be designed around available space within the home.. Many closets also include shelving to maximize the storage space inside. Modular closet storage allows users to take advantage of the vertical space in a closet as well as the horizontal, and it is typically customized to fit an existing closet. Generally, master bedrooms have larger closets than the other bedrooms in a home.

Alternative Fuel Vehicle. You can even request an Alternative Fuel Vehicle for your next Daily Rental need!. Why switch to vehicles powered by alternative fuels?. According to the US Department of Energy, emissions from the 200 million cars and trucks on US roads – mostly hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide – account for about 50% of all air pollution and more than 80% of urban air pollution. Driving alternative fueled vehicles could reduce the level of vehicle emissions, and choosing domestically produced alternative fuels - instead of imported oil – could help reduce the trade deficit, create jobs and promote economic activity.. UCLA Fleet continually monitors the availability of new-state-of-the-art Alternative Fuel Vehicles to meet the needs of our customers.

“I’m convinced that we are not totally ready to play with three forwards,” he added. “I want to see and understand how our opponents will line up.

“It’s a very delicate game, we have to make sure that we don’t offer them space.”

The tactician, who is without the suspended Daniele De Rossi and Daniel Pablo Osvaldo, gave Torino’s Cerci his debut last week as he looks for a right-sided attacker.

“We’ve called up Cerci and Lazio’s Antonio Candreva who can both play on the right of the trident. Cerci is more of an attacker, Candreva more of a midfielder. But the doubt remains between Cerci and Giaccherini.

“Alessandro Diamanti? He’s having an important season at Bologna, but there are precise roles in the national team, especially when it comes to constructing play.

“I’ve spoken to him, he likes to start on the right and cut in centrally, but we’ll look at other opportunities for now. Cerci is more of an attacker than he is.”

“To play with two blocks of important players allows you to work with players who already know each other. It becomes easier tactically.”

There are set to be two changes to the side that faced Brazil in Geneva with Claudio Marchisio and Stephan El Shaarawy expected to be brought into the team.

“I’m convinced that El Shaarawy can play well in a 4-3-3 or with a four-man midfield. I’m also convinced that he and Mario Balotelli, by playing game after game, can do some really interesting things.”

Malta are bottom of Group B, having conceded 12 goals in their four qualifying matches so far.

“Would I be happy with a 1-0? It depends on how we go about securing it. The points are what matter right now. But I’m convinced that you get results by playing well.

“I hope we create as many chances as we did against Brazil.

“To get six points from our next two games – Malta and the Czech Republic – would be of fundamental importance in terms of qualification.”

I've stayed at this resort several times, at the Palace in particular and once at the Royal Suites. The refurbishment has been excellent, and the resort is really a credit to the Punta Cana region.. Food, drinks, service is probably one of the best I've experienced - with a beach that is simply beautiful. you will never feel bored, and with lots of choice and variety you can choose to partake or not in activities so if you wish.. Only one small negative - MANAGEMENT TAKE NOTE - which I can see more and more of on Tripadvisor, is repetitive reviews singling out "king kong" and "Charli" as being the best things since sliced bread.. I have witnessed both these butlers pressure guests into writing reviews on tripadvisor and similar other websites to detail their fabulous stay made more so fabulous by these two men. don't feel harassed - I certainly wasn't. a gentle no thanks is all that is needed.. the resort has hundreds of staff to name but these few beats me!More. - Free Parking. - Breakfast included

Papercut is a packaging factory based out of Doha, Qatar. They gave me the challenge of creating an identity that would be flexible enough to work across both print and digital mediums. The biggest challenge I had to overcome was how to convey what they do to their audience in the simplest way possible in both a visual and written format.. The Papercut logo mark is constructed from building blocks that represent the core elements of what the company does making eco friendly paper packaging/product. The identity uses a flexible system with a few simple rules, but allows an infinite number of possibilities when being put to use. This became especially important when dealing with documents and presentations that didn’t use additional visual elements, such as photography or illustration, yet needed to constantly remain visually interesting.

Q:

Reading Image data from Table's Cell via Apache POI

I am stuck in one place and I need help immediately,following is the my problem.
Actually I am using Apache POI (XWPF) to read word (.docx) document, I am able to read successfully the table data except the image which is also inside the table's cell. Since I am new to this Api but as per my understanding i think we can read image byte data from cell as well.
POIXMLDocumentPart pictureData=(POIXMLDocumentPart)imageCell.getPart();

PackageRelationship packageRelationship=pictureData.getPackageRelationship();

System.out.println("Source URI:"+packageRelationship.getSourceURI());

System.out.println("Target URI:"+packageRelationship.getTargetURI());

in above code I can get Image URI as Target but i don't know how to get Image's binary data. 
Any Idea friends...
Thanks,
-Javed

A:

First, from a Table Cell, get the list of paragraphs. Next, from the paragraph, get the list of Runs. Finally, from the run, get the list of pictures embedded in the run, and you're largely there.
The .docx text extractor in Apache Tika shows how to do all this, see the source code of it for details. Generally though, it's something like
for (XWPFParagraph p : cell.getParagraphs()) {
  for (XWPFRun run : p.getRuns()) {
    for (XWPFPicture pic : run.getEmbeddedPictures()) {
       byte[] pictureData = pic.getPictureData().getData();
    }
  }
}

.
There is also a much less common kind of way of embedding pictures into a .docx file, which is much more fiddly to work with. On a XWPFDocument, you can use getAllPictures() and getAllPackagePictures() to track down the others, but that won't tell you where in the file the pictures belong.

U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to board Marine One en route to his Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Florida following the release of the Mueller report at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 18, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Barria

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will travel to Japan on May 25-28 for meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo, the White House said in a statement on Thursday.

The two leaders will discuss North Korea, “including efforts to achieve final, fully verified denuclearization,” the statement said.

“The two leaders will also explore ways to advance their shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, including steps that will strengthen our bilateral trade and investment relationship,” it said.

Venezuela sits atop the world's largest proved reserves of petroleum, even bigger than Saudi Arabia's. In 2007, Venezuela's Bolivarian socialist government under President Hugo Chavez seized without compensation the assets of several private American oil production and service companies then operating in that country. In those heady days, global oil prices were ascending and would eventually peak in July 2008 above $132 per barrel. This oil price boom boosted Venezuela's GDP per capita to nearly $15,000 annually, thus bolstering Chavez's political popularity. But peak oil fears abated as they always do when demand draws forth more supply, causing prices to fall.

In the succeeding years, socialist efficiency has had its totally predictable effects on the Bolivarian Republic's oil industry—it's cratered. When Hugo Chavez came to power in 1999, Venezuela was producing more than 3 million barrels per day of crude. With the help of billions in loans from China, Chavez was able to sustain production at around 2.5 million barrels per day. In the past year, production has fallen below 1 million barrels per day, the lowest rate of production in 75 years. As a result, per capita GDP has fallen by nearly half in the past six years.

Now, the Chinese government is apparently becoming reluctant to throw good money after bad. As a consequence, Chavez's hapless successor, President Nicolas Maduro, is now reportedly proposing to sell a majority stake in, and give control of the country's state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, to private international oil companies. This offer may be less than tempting to Big Oil since the Bolivarian Republic still owes billions to the oil companies whose property it seized 10 years ago.

Abstract. Congenital urethral polyps may cause hematuria, various degrees of outflow obstruction and display a variety of, mostly nonspecific micturition abnormalities in young boys and infants, and should be considered and investigated when recurrent or persistent hematuria and voiding disturbances are encountered. Voiding cystography is the best available diagnostic method to detect urethral polyps. Following diagnosis, prompt complete resection of polyp is indicated. Resolution of signs and symptoms and excellent prognosis are the rule in most of the reported cases. In view of the rarity of this significant pathological condition, we present our experience with 6 children who suffered from urethral polyps and outline the principles of diagnostic evaluation and management of the child with urethral polyp.. Keywords. - Children. - Hematuria. - Urethral polyp. - Voiding disorders

I strive to be unbiased on this website regarding the best sources of electricity. Truly, I don’t know which is “best.” I just try to lay out the information that I know.. Because we live in Japan, my son and I have an English lesson together every morning. We’ve been going through a book of American states, and now we are on the state of Iowa. One interesting tidbit that the book gives is that 25% of the electricity in Iowa comes from wind energy.. So is this true?. I looked it up:. According to the Iowa Wind Energy Association’s website (above,) 37% of electricity is produced by wind. Wow!. One of the main problems of renewable sources of energy is that they don’t produce enough electricity to power our energy-hungry world. But I think 37% is quite a lot! So, anyway, good for Iowa….

Radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery in small breast carcinoma: long-term results of a randomized trial.
Breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is a widely accepted form of treatment in patients with breast cancer of limited extent. Many attempts have been made to identify subgroups of patients who might avoid radiotherapy. Between 1987 and 1989, 579 women with carcinoma of the breast were randomly assigned to quadrantectomy, axillary dissection and radiotherapy (299) and to quadrantectomy with axillary dissection without radiotherapy (280). Eligible patients were women with a breast carcinoma less than 2.5 cm in maximum diameter up to 70 years of age. Primary endpoints were intra-breast tumour reappearance (IBTR) and all-cause mortality. The number of IBTRs was significantly higher in patients treated with surgery alone (59 cases out of 273; 10-year crude cumulative incidence of 23.5%) than in patients treated with surgery plus radiotherapy (16 cases out of 294; 10-year crude cumulative incidence of 5.8%). The difference in IBTR frequency between the two treatments appeared to be particularly high in women up to 45 years of age, tending to decrease with increasing age up to no apparent difference in women older than 65 years. Overall survival curves for the two groups, did not differ significantly (P = 0.326). However, a limited survival advantage was evident after radiotherapy for node-positive women. After breast-conserving surgery radiotherapy appears indicated in all patients up to 55 years of age, in patients with positive axillary nodes, and in patients with extensive intraductal component at histology. The data suggest that radiotherapy may be avoided in patients older than 65, and may be optional in women aged 56-65 years with negative nodes.

Organochlorine compound levels in fertile and infertile women from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The aim of the study was quantify organochlorine compounds in women seeking for infertility treatment (n = 15) and in spontaneously pregnant ones (n = 21). A questionnaire was applied regarding lifestyle, occupational and reproductive history. Blood samples were collected from both groups. From the pesticides studied, pp'DDE was detected in 100% of infertile women, at higher mean levels than in pregnant women (3.02 mcg/L vs. 0.88 mcg/L; p = 0.001; power of 69%), without correlation with the etiology of infertility. Levels of the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were low, with positive samples in 100% in the infertile women for PCBs 138, 153, 180, while in pregnant women, they were 85.7% for congeners 138 and 153. Only PCB180 showed significance, with frequency of 71.4% (p = 0.019). The risk factors for female infertility were: age, consumption of untreated water and of canned foods. Exposure to the most prevalent organochlorine compounds described in literature was confirmed in the study, indicating that pp'DDE may adversely influence female fertility.

We thank Santilli et al for their interest in our article and for emphasizing the potential important contribution of psychological factors to the development of subclinical atherosclerosis. Psychological factors, such as depression, anger, sustained anxiety, and alexithymia, have been associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and in HIV-infected patients.1,2

There are many psychological, social, and cultural factors that may be potentially important determinants or modifiers of the atherosclerosis pathway from subclinical to overt vascular disease. Health-damaging psychological factors, such as stress, negative emotions, and health-promoting factors such as social support, are important predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke and may play a similar or larger role in CVD and stroke relative to traditional risk factors, including hypertension.3 However, available evidence addressing psychological, social, and cultural variables in relation to CVD and stroke and its intermediate phenotypes, such as carotid intima-media thickness and plaque in the general population as well as in diverse race-ethnic groups, is limited in the United States.

In the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS), prestroke social isolation was a predictor of poststroke outcomes,4 suggesting that a lack of social support contributes to poorer outcomes because of poor compliance, depression, and stress. Limited research has addressed sociocultural processes, such as culturally driven beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, that may help explain vascular risk in the general population and in individuals at increased risk for CVD and stroke. In addition, little is known about vulnerability factors, such as ethnic-specific stressors or resiliency factors such as family cohesion and social support, that have been suggested as possible mechanisms that may exacerbate or buffer vascular risk among diverse age, sex, and race-ethnic groups. In addition, little is known about the association between neighborhood environments, either physical (eg, food and recreational access) or social (eg, social cohesion), and risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.5

The exact mechanism by which these psychosocial and cultural factors affect development of atherosclerosis is not well-understood. Alterations in the autonomic nervous system as a result of chronic health-damaging stressors may be the common mechanism linking them to cardiovascular responses and to an increased risk of atherosclerosis. More research is needed to elucidate the health-damaging and health-promoting biological mechanisms of psychological, social, and cultural factors on atherosclerosis.

Therefore, we agree with Santilli et al that psychological and sociocultural factors may have a major role in the development of subclinical and clinical CVD, and research in this area is critically needed for CVD health prevention and health promotion.

Of particular concern to police were the traffic and personnel hazards created by popped manhole covers hidden under the rising waters. Police were thankful the traffic volume in the area was minimal due to the early morning hours. By 8 a.m. water levels throughout the city had subsided.. While the Willits Elementary Charter School learned the consequences of building in a floodway and flood plain, the buildings were built on concrete blocks designed to keep the buildings above a 100 year flood.

The play area suffered some damage but volunteers were already working to restore it to pre-flood conditions..

History of Bruges. The name 'Bruges' was first found on 9th century coins. Then, the name was spelt ‘Bryghia’, a Celtic word which means ‘quay’, as an estuary, ‘Het Zwin’, was created by multiple floods.. The link with the sea was the beginning of the economical prosperity of Bruges in the Middle Ages. We could call the 15th century ‘The Golden Age’ of Bruges. The Dukes of Burgundy made Bruges one of their main residences, which attracted a large number of artists. This resulted in the contstruction of many beautiful buildings and the establishment of the Flemish School of Primitive Painting.. From the 16th until the 19th century, Bruges (Flanders) was occupied by the Spanish, the Austrians, the French and the Dutch. With the independence of Belgium in 1830, an economical and cultural revival gradually occurred.. Bruges became the European capital of culture in 2002 and was declared world heritage by the UNESCO.. Tourism is the main source of income for Bruges.. You can find more information on:

Nuristani languages, group of six languages and several dialects that form a subset of the Indo-Aryan subdivision of the Indo-Iranian group of Indo-European languages. Nuristani languages are spoken by more than 100,000 people, predominantly in Afghanistan.. These languages were formerly labeled Kafiri, a designation now considered offensive. They were once thought to have been members of the Dardic language group. In the mid-20th century, however, the Norwegian linguist Georg Morgenstierne discovered several linguistic characteristics and archaisms in the Nuristani group that suggested its very early separation from other branches of Indo-Iranian.. The Nuristani group includes six languages—Kati, Kamviri, Prasuni, Waigali, Tregami, and Ashkun—each of which has several dialects. There is no written literary tradition associated with any of these languages.. Learn More in these related articles:.

Improving Target Pose Estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery (in Japanese). Abstract. Automatic target recognition (ATR) from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image has been studied for many years. In recent years, many convolution neural networks (CNNs) for SAR ATR based on deep learning have been proposed, but most of them classify target classes from fixed size target chip extracted from SAR image. On the other hand, we proposed CNN for end-to-end SAR ATR that input arbitrary size SAR image of multiple targets and outputs the position, class, and pose of each detected target as SAR ATR image. Among them, the evaluation metrics of the pose class of the CNN is lower than the evaluation metrics of the target classes. In this paper, we propose a method to improve posture estimation performance of end-to-end SAR ATR.. © 2018 IEICE. Reference. Proceedings of the 2018 IEICE General Conference, B-2-25, Mar. 2018.

Now hackers have come up with virtual ways to be transparent – at least to the law: cyber cloaks. Cyber cloaks are most powerful for those engaged in criminal cyber activity, as it offers the freedom from consequence of persecution.

In general, the cloak consists of one or more of five core ingredients, and there are almost immeasurable ‘flavors’ that can be combined with great care and precision. I will not go into great detail as not to promote specific attacks, however the notion of how these techniques work is most important to help protect your organization against their use.

Summer Camp at the Center for Americas First Horse/. I wanted to thank you for the summer scholarship money that you gave to me to attend the summer camp at the Center for Americas First Horse. I spent two weeks there this summer riding and learning more about horses, how to care for them and most importantly I learned more about building my relationship with my horse. I have taken what I learned and done some school projects to help other people see how special horses are and how fun it is to spend time with them. I did two western dressage tests in a show this fall and was able to use what I learned at summer at camp! I love spending time at the barn with the horses even on days when I am not riding. When I grow up I hope I can do something that includes horses because they are so important to me in my life. Thank you again for the scholarship and I hope to go to the camp again next year. I attached some pictures from the summer and fall I hope you like them J. Thank you,. Natalie Start.

Medical imaging devices have different dimensions depending on the embodiment of a detector unit that is included in the medical imaging device and/or depending on the field of application, and therefore differently embodied housing units are used for the different medical imaging devices.
For example, depending on the field of application, differently embodied magnets are used for individual magnetic resonance devices. The differently embodied magnets differ, for example, in respect of a magnetic field strength and/or in respect of a use, e.g. as a whole body scanner or as a head scanner, etc. The differently embodied magnets also affect a geometric dimension of the individual magnetic resonance devices, which therefore require a housing unit that has been adapted to the magnetic resonance device in each case and includes an adapted housing cover. In this context, the individual housing units or housing covers for the different magnetic resonance devices differ in particular in respect of a length and/or a height and/or a width.

[Virulence factors in strains of Escherichia coli isolated in urinary tract infections].
In 21 strains of E. coli isolated from patients with cystitis and asymptomatic bacteriuria the authors assessed the group, mannososensitive and mannoresistant agglutination of human, bovine, chick, guinea pig, sheep and pig erythrocytes, the production of haemolysis, colicins, aerobactin, the capacity of strains to induce oedema on mouse paws, the lethal effect in mice, the resistance to tetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, ampicillin and sulfamethoxidine, the transmission of resistance and sensitivity of strains to the action of fresh human serum. In ten strains the authors recorded also the production of haemolysin and the lethality for mice, in four strains the production of colicin V. production of aerobactin and serum resistance. In three strains the aerobactin production was recorded concurrently with the haemolysin production. In none of the samples P. fimbriae were found.

Peter Craigie Lecture. I’m currently visiting the University of Calgary to give the Peter Craigie Lecture: “A ‘Bookish’ Religion: Reading, Writing, and Disseminating Texts in Early Christianity.” (Tuesday, 12 January, 7.30pm., if anyone nearby reads this blog site and would like to attend.) The university online advert is here.. The lecture gives the gist of a chapter in my forthcoming book on early Christian distinctives in the Roman world (publication expected late summer 2016).. I knew Peter Craigie for a number of years and was shocked with many others at news of his death in an automobile crash in 1985. For a brief bio on him, consult the Wikipedia article here.. 2 Comments. I’ll be there!.

A team of Ohio State University professors who authored the study analyzed data collected on 1,026 children aged 5 to 8 years old. They found that for those living in owned homes versus rental units:. In fact, the researchers found an independent effect of homeownership on children's outcomes that was unrelated to household income and education, marital status, stay-at-home mothers, number of siblings and neighborhood characteristics. The owned-home environment was judged to be 13% to 23% better than in rented homes due to higher levels of:. The researchers also found that benefits of homeownership for children increased the longer families lived in their own homes. Longevity in one place was thought to result in more neighborhood and community involvement on the part of parents and longer stays in the same schools and school systems for the kids--creating a more stable emotional environment for learning.

The drug maker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries said on Monday that it had agreed to pay $512 million to settle claims that a subsidiary, Cephalon, paid generic manufacturers to keep their own cheaper versions of a drug off the market, a practice that the Supreme Court ruled in 2013 could be illegal in some cases.

The lawsuit was brought by drug wholesalers and other companies that buy drugs directly from manufacturers, who argued they were forced to pay inflated prices for Provigil, a medicine that helps people with narcolepsy and other sleep disorders stay awake.

The settlement, which must be approved by a judge, is the largest in the history of such cases ever paid to direct purchasers of drugs, lawyers for the plaintiffs said in a motion filed Friday with Judge Mitchell S. Goldberg of the United States District Court’s Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

“That’s a great result for consumers,” said David A. Balto, an antitrust lawyer and a former Federal Trade Commission policy director. “This was an agreement that was a pretty naked effort to take generic drugs off the market.”

Rundown of Recent Question of the Week Polls

As I like to do from time to time, I’m providing a rundown of recent Question of the Week polls. I love these polls, as (to me, at least) they always provide a fascinating glimpse into how roadies experience the myriad aspects of our shared passion.

From knocking off big rides on your personal “cycling bucket list” to the percentage of readers who have broken a clavicle in a crash, there are always surprises in these little Q-and-A’s.

Cycling Bucket List Items

Let’s start with the Question from four issues ago: How Many of Your Cycling Bucket List Items Have You Checked Off?

The leading response, with more than 43% of the vote, was: I don’t really have a cycling bucket list.

Interestingly, the next-biggest vote-getter was at the other end of the spectrum. With just over 20% of the vote: How can anybody ever finish this list? It should be endless!

An equal number of you – 8% – have checked off from 3-5 or 5-10 of your bucket list items. And 5% answered: All of them! I’m looking for new ones.

Broken Collarbones While Riding

The Question posed not long after my recent crash brought another array of answers. We asked: Have You Ever Fractured Your Clavicle (Collarbone) in a Crash?

Over 850 of you weighed in. This time, I was surprised to find that so many of you have, in fact, suffered this “most common cycling injury.” More than 26% said, Yes, once. And other 6+% answered, Yes. More than once.

Thankfully, an even bigger percentage, nearly 48, replied, No, never. Here’s hoping you never join the affirmative crowd on this issue!

Longest Time Off Bike Due to a Crash

The sheer percentage of you who have broken a clavicle, among other such cycling injuries, in part accounts for the more than 53% of you who said A month or more in reply to the Question: What is the longest time you have been off the road (not including trainer) due to a crash injury?

And equal number, 9.5%, of you chose Less than month and Less than 2 weeks. Among the luckiest of you, at just under 8%, said Less than a week. And the truly blessed – just over 15% of readers – said I’ve always been able to ride.

Your Preferred Drivetrain

Finally, catching up on last week’s Question, What Drivetrain Do You Ride on Your Main Bike?

Three responsed dominated among the over 750 votes on this poll:

With just under 30%, the biggest vote-getter was 50×34, 10-speed.

The 11-speed version of this same compact combination netted over 22% of the vote. And the good old standard, 53×39, 10-speed, got nearly 11% of the vote.

More Ice Cream Weather

Just when we thought the weather was going to remain beautiful for the rest of the season we had a couple of really hot and humid days last week. Those days always remind me why I prefer winter than summer. In the other hand, they are a very good excuse to make ice cream. This time I experimented with two flavors that I had had my eye on for sometime.

When I was at the library last week I saw this book in the New Arrivals section with the words Mexican Cooking in the front (by Jane Milton). I immediately picked it up and decided to take it home when I saw it was filled with many recipes I didn’t even remember existed. One of those was Agua Fresca de Horchata, an aromatic and creamy rice drink that doesn’t contain any milk. I did, however, add some milk to make it ice cream, but I am sure it would’ve worked perfectly without it, too.

This recipe is my entry for The Royal Foodie Joust over at Jenn’s forum. This month we had to create something using whole (non-ground) grains, ginger and any kind of citrus. So this was a perfect match. Originally, horchata doesn’t have any ginger in it, but the addition in this recipe was just delicious.

Rinse rice thoroughly under running water. Cover and soak for at least 2 hours, but it is better to soak overnight.

Drain rice, but reserve 1½ to 2 cups of the liquid.

In a blender or food processor grind the rice as finely as possible. Add some of the soaking liquid if necessary.

Add cinnamon, ginger, vanilla extract and the zest of the lime and continue grinding. Add the rest of the water and milks until everything is well blended.

Transfer to a saucepan and add the egg yolks. Turn heat on to medium low and whisk constantly until the temperature of the mixture reaches around 115ºF or when you can still touch it with your finger but not for long.

Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before transferring to the ice cream machine.

The second recipe is my entry for Nick’s event The Great Peanut Butter Exhibition #4. This time the theme is No-Bake recipes, perfect for a gelato! I was looking online for gelato recipes and I came across David Lebovitz’s website where I found this fantastic Pistachio Gelato recipe made with cornstarch instead of eggs. However, it took a long time to freeze, I am thinking it was because of the peanut butter, but once it did the texture and the flavor were amazing!

Peanut Butter and banana gelato

Ingredients:

1 can evaporated milk

1 can sweetened condensed milk

1/3 cup cornstarch

2 ripe bananas

1/3 cup peanut butter

a few drops of lime juice

Preparation:

Mix 1/2 can evaporated and corn starch together until the starch is dissolved and the mixture smooth.

In a medium size saucepan heat the rest of the evaporated milk and condensed milk.

Smash the bananas and add them to the saucepan along with the peanut butter. Whisk constantly until all the ingredients are mixed together.

When the mixture starts to boil stir in the cornstarch and whisk stir constantly for about 3 minutes. Don’t let the mixture thicken.

Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.

Freeze following ice cream maker instructions.

Follow ice cream machine instructions and freeze before serving.

The texture of this two frozen desserts are very unique. Because of the ground rice horchata has a grainy texture that some people might not like. The gelato made with the cornstarch, in the other hand, has a very silky texture that I just loved. What’s your favorite ice cream?

The proteins that span lipid bilayers are extremely important in nature. It is their role to selectively bridge the barriers that maintain cellular organization. In particular, those proteins that span the plasma membrane of cells not only mediate the transfer of metabolites into and out of cells, but also the transduction of signals across the cell boundary. Alterations in the cell surface have been noted in many diseased tissues including tumors. It remains largely a mystery how these important proteins are transported from their site of synthesis to the cell surface. Biogenesis of the glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been widely studied as a model for the biogenesis of plasma membrane glycoproteins that span the lipid bilayer. We have been using immunofluorescence microscopy and cryoultramicrotomy in conjunction with immunoelectron microscopy to study the cellular structures through which this protein passes en route to the plasma membrane. The use of cryoultramicrotomy (ultra-thin frozen section technology) is of tremendous importance when attempting to localize antigens within a tissue or cell. By cutting through the membrane that effectively compartmentalize such structures, one renders the antigen accessible to antibodies during immunostaining. We propose to examine: 1) Intermeidates in the intracellular pathway followed by the VSV G protein. 2) The role of the overall structural organization of the cytoplasm in the intracellular transport of the G protein. 3) The mechanisms involved in the sorting of membrane and secretory proteins. 4) The biogenesis of the interaction between an integral membrane protein (the VSV G protein) and a peripheral membrane protein (the VSV M protein). It is hoped that these studies will contribute to our understanding of the creation and maintainance of the cell surface and subcellular organization.

For, 2017.. One of Geller’s favorite books, Death in Venice, by Thomas Mann was the main muse for his showing and it was all based on the main character of the book and also movie, Gustav Von Aschenbach.. During Geller’s preview, we saw a variety of oversized coats and t-shirts, along with well-worn and high-grade Japanese textiles. Geller’s use of complimentary colors proved to be the perfect fit when paired with his textiles of all lengths and widths.. This is the start of something new for Geller and it’s definitely an interesting direction.. See the Gallery below..

What is this?

HALIFAX – Saint Mary’s University says after a year of working behind the scenes it’s ready to roll out a plan that will close the door on a dark year in the school’s history.

The Welcome Week revamp was sparked by the controversial chant that came to light during last year’s introduction week events. At a now cancelled event called Turf Burn students and frosh leaders sang a sexually explicit chant condoning non-consensual sex and under age sex.

The chant was widely condemned, and in the aftermath the student association president resigned and the university took over the management of all Welcome Week activities.

“There’s a great deal happening and most of it is going to roll out and become visible at the start of the academic year,” said Margaret Murphy, Associate Vice President of External Affairs at St. Mary’s. “So it starts with Welcome Week but we’re not going to accomplish cultural change in one week. It’s the start of activities that will roll out through the month of September, through this entire academic year and continues years beyond.”

Welcome Week will be the start of what she says she hopes will be a much bigger cultural shift at the university.

A cultural shift is exactly what Lewis Rendell says the university needs. She was the media contact for the campus Women’s Centre when the controversy was sparked in September 2013. She says she felt pressured by people at her own school to stop speaking out, ultimately she said the stress forced her to take a break from the university. She won’t be back until January but she says she hopes to see a difference.

“I’m hoping for a bigger focus for safety for women and LGBT people on campus because historically at St Mary’s it hasn’t been the most welcoming place,” said Rendell.

SMU administration said this year’s introduction week will have a stronger focus on academics, and faculty will be more involved in the activities. Murphy said the activities will also involve learning modules and more training around sexual health and campus safety.

“Talking to them about alcohol prevention, bystander training, talking about consent. We’re going to be teaching bystander training, rolling it out peer to peer, starting with the new students, starting with the student leaders, its also going to touch faculty and staff,” said Murphy.

But Murphy says university administration recognizes they still have a ways to go before everyone feels safe again.

“I’m really hopeful that in the year ahead that those students that if they felt marginalized in the past, that they see the difference,” said Murphy. “We want to stand for the campus that is welcoming to the LGBTQ community as well as all of the other diversity on campus.”

She knows it will take more than just one introductory week to make that change a reality.

“If people see something going on, they know that they have the support of the St. Mary’s community, whether it’s their fellow students, their professors, there is support. If you see something happening you can step in and be that positive bystander and they’re not going to be alone,” said Murphy. “That’s not all going to happen in week one, that takes time, and it takes people seeing it starting with student leaders and other leaders on campus.”

What happened at UConn on Saturday, April 1 was remarkable. Cheshire Academy sent its Science Olympiad team for the annual State-level competition. This year, 11 of the Academy’s “brainards” competed in 15 events, and the results are pretty good

Since last year, Science Olympiad has become a full-time varsity sport for fall and winter seasons. So our team is still like a baby compared to those of many other schools, but it is learning and growing up fast. Compared to 10 events participated last year, this time we completed 5 more – a 50% increase if you will, for those hidden “brainards” or math geeks.

The students have all worked really hard throughout the winter. Depends on the form of their contest, they either needed to teach themselves some hard theories and facts or construct their own engineering projects. For example, Grace Sun ’19 signed up for an event called Disease Detective, which came in the form of a 14-page-test. On the contrary, Richard Yang ’18 spent his two seasons on his delicate helicopter skirt made out of fine pieces of balsa and carbon fiber. After numerous tests and adjustments, he had to undergo the event supervisor’s strict inspections and compete for the longest time aloft.

Another event called Write It Do It is yet another form that is different from those mentioned above. The event tests student’s ability to express themselves clearly and concisely through writing instructions and follow instructions. Writer Grace Greene ’17 said the sample she got was, “the most random compilation of objects [she] had ever seen;” it consisted of toothpicks, Easter eggs, a skull ring, popsicles, waffles tickets, and much more crazy stuff. Thanks to her talent for writing, it did not take her partner Parker Gagnon ’17 a long time to figure out what he was assembling.

In order to get to UConn on time, the students had to gather at Science Department Co-Chair Mr. Cirmo’s office at 6:00 on Saturday morning, and board a school bus to begin their expedition. The weather showcased its own April Fool’s surprise by landing sleet and snowflakes on the campus. Regardless of the final result, the sheer experience of being able to compete against other high schools and to communicate with them was invaluable. At the end of the day, every contest had to adhere to the standardized rules and procedures, but there are boundless ways of how to approach a solution. What truly matters is trying to solve problems creatively and learning from the process so that we can always more progress – that’s how science works!

Cheshire Academy 2017 Science Olympiad results: a number represents ranking among all the schools, and “–” means not participated:

This week Nancy ’17 produced a video offering a sneak peak inside the Academy hot spots, including Cheshire Coffee, Dunkin’ Donuts, and downtown New Haven shopping sites. Watch the video to see where our boarding students go when they’re off campus:

The immunoglobulin lambda-like gene cluster (14.1, 16.1 and F lambda 1) contains gene(s) selectively expressed in pre-B cells and is the human counterpart of the mouse lambda 5 gene.
A human immunoglobulin (Ig)-related gene, covering approximately 8 kb, was isolated from a cosmid genomic library, by hybridization with a C lambda probe and with a lambda-like probe. This gene was identified as 14.1 It belongs to the human lambda-like cluster which is composed of three genes (14.1, 16.1 and F lambda 1) that do not rearrange. Sequence data indicate that 14.1 is organized similarly to the mouse lambda 5 gene. It contains three exons with lengths of 69, 38, and 106 codons as compared with 65, 38, and 106 for exons 1, 2, and 3 of mouse lambda 5, respectively. The corresponding homology values were 61, 66 and 75.5%. Using a 14.1 specific probe containing exon 1, we showed that this gene was selectively expressed in human pre-B cell lines. It is likely to encode a 213-amino acid lambda-like light chain that would associate with mu chains and play an important role in the early steps of B cell differentiation.

Texas Tower (lighthouse)

A Texas Tower lighthouse is a structure which is similar to an off-shore oil platform. Seven of these structures were built in the 1960s off the shores of the United States. Automation started in the late 1970s, which led to the obsolescence of the housing built for the keepers which resulted in such a large structure. Three of the towers were dismantled over time due to deteriorating structural conditions among other problems, while another one was destroyed in a ship collision. The last Texas Tower was deactivated in 2016 having served for over half a century. Today only three of the former lights remain, one of which was converted into a bed-and-breakfast.

Design and construction
These lights were all constructed at offshore stations previously served by lightships. An attempt to set a caisson light at Diamond Shoals off the North Carolina coast in the late 1880s showed that the techniques of the day were not adequate, and it was not until the 1960s that the Coast Guard attempted to replace the lightships with permanent structures. By that point, experience with offshore oil drilling platforms provided a model.

The six lights were similar in form and, excepting the first, nearly identical in construction. Each consisted of a framework of four steel, concrete-filled piles driven deep into the ocean floor, upon which a square platform was set. This platform contained the living quarters and was assembled from a set of modules. A tower was attached to one corner and housed the light. The roof of the living quarters formed a helipad; a dock was also provided low on the framework. The name of the station was displayed on a large sign on each side of the light, on the side of or just below the platform.

The quarters provided living space for six regular crewmen plus three transients. Normally, four crewmembers were on duty at a time, with regular rotation to shore. In addition to monitoring and maintaining the beacon, the crew also operated weather reporting equipment.

Automation and decommissioning
While these towers have stood against any storms thus far, two of them have fallen victim to ship collisions. In 1996, Ambrose Light was struck by a Greek oil tanker, damaging it severely enough that it was replaced in 1999 by a new, smaller tower (which itself was struck twice before being demolished by the Coast Guard in 2008). A month after the Ambrose accident, Savannah Light was completely demolished when a container ship struck it.

By that time all of these stations had been automated, beginning with the Diamond Shoals Light in 1977. Inspection of the (then) survivors revealed that four out of five showed substantial deterioration. Brenton Reef Light was demolished in 1992 and replaced with a buoy. The Buzzard Bay Light was demolished and replaced with a smaller tower in 1996; the Diamond Shoals and Frying Pan Shoals lights have been extinguished; both towers still stand and are now privately owned. Chesapeake Light was retrofitted with solar panels and was the last tower to be an active navigational aid. In August, 2016 the light was deactivated by NOAA after it was determined that the structure was deteriorating. The design of the Texas tower is now considered obsolete since there is no longer a need for a structure to house the keepers.

Towers built
The first Texas tower in the United States was the Buzzards Bay Light, located in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, which was commissioned on November 1, 1961. In total seven Texas tower lights were constructed over a period of six years. Chesapeake Light was the last to be deactivated in 2016 after it was used for NOAA and NASA to carry out studies.
