Novel cytotoxic and biological agents for prostate cancer: where will the money be in 2005?
In 2004, docetaxel-based chemotherapy became the first treatment capable of extending life in androgen-independent prostate cancer. The era of therapeutic nihilism in this disease has thus been put to rest and a broad range of agents is being tested with the goal of improving on the successes of 2004. Lessons learned from other tumour types will need to be applied to prostate cancer in order to harness the bounty of available ideas. Target amplification or activating mutations and not merely the presence of a target are likely to be important to the success of targeted agents. Thus, the promise of the current crop of targeted agents is most likely to be realised when pursued in the context of well-credentialed targets and tested in highly translational clinical trials that are capable not only of assessing tumour response, but also of evaluating the status of the targeted pathway. The most promising agents in clinical development are reviewed.

An emerging clinical approach to treat substance abuse disorders involves a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy whereby addicts learn to reduce their reactivity to drug-paired stimuli through cue-exposure or extinction training. It is, however, unlikely that extinction training would be consistently effective as a stand- alone treatment in populations that have abused drugs long-term because the key memory systems that are recruited during extinction training are impaired by long-term drug use. There is a critical need to understand mechanisms underlying extinction learning and to establish viable strategies to increase the efficacy of extinction therapies for substance abuse disorders. Key elements of the proposed research plan build on recent advances made in the treatment of conditioned fear and anxiety and other cognitive disorders by pharmacological modulation of glycine, an obligatory co-transmitter at the NMDA glutamate receptor complex. The specific aims of the proposed research in rats and non-human primates are to: 1) elucidate the neurobiological substrates of extinction learning; 2) evaluate selected glycine site partial agonists and glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors as candidate pharmacotherapies to increase the efficacy of extinction training; and 3) determine neurobiological substrates of glycine site modulation of extinction learning. The intravenous cocaine self-administration procedure will be used in the proposed studies because the contingency between drug delivery and behavior is likely paramount for understanding the persistent abuse of drugs in people. Measurement of Fos protein expression (a marker for neuronal activation) and evaluation with anisomycin (an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis) will be used in rats to investigate the neurobiological substrates of extinction learning following cocaine self-administration training. In addition, the proposed research in rats and non-human primates will specifically investigate the effects of the partial glycine agonist D-cycloserine and selective GlyT1 inhibitors for their ability to accelerate extinction learning and to subsequently reduce cocaine cue reactivity and re-acquisition of cocaine self-administration. Animal research involving pharmacological modulation of learning and memory is well-served by an integrated comparative strategy using appropriately selected laboratory animals. This approach is especially relevant for research involving cognitive enhancing drugs, where non-human primates can serve as a key translational interface for the development of pharmacotherapies.

Host lymphodepletion augments T cell adoptive immunotherapy through enhanced intratumoral proliferation of effector cells.
T-cell adoptive immunotherapy for stringent murine tumor models, such as intracranial, s.c., or advanced pulmonary metastases, routinely uses lymphodepletive conditioning regimens before T-cell transfer, like recent clinical protocols. In this study, we examined whether host lymphodepletion is an obligatory component of curative T-cell therapy; we also examined the mechanism by which it augments therapy. Mice bearing intracranial, s.c., or 10-day pulmonary metastases of MCA 205 received total body irradiation conditioning or were nonirradiated before i.v. transfer of tumor-reactive T cells. Total body irradiation was not required for immunologically specific curative therapy and induction of memory provided that a 3- to 12-fold higher T-cell dose was administered. The mechanism involved enhanced intratumoral proliferation of T-effector cells in total body irradiation-conditioned recipients. In this tumor model, intratumoral T(reg) cells were not detected; consequently, intratumoral T-effector cells produced identical amounts of IFN-gamma upon ex vivo antigen stimulation irrespective of total body irradiation conditioning. Thus, host lymphodepletion augments T-cell immunotherapy through enhanced antigen-driven proliferation of T-effector cells, but curative therapy can be achieved in nonconditioned hosts by escalation of T-cell dose. These data provide a rationale for dose escalation of T-effector cells in situations where single or repeated lymphodepletion regimens are contraindicated.

Ranking systems have their limitations and imperfections – we know. Yet it’s worth sharing that the latest U.S. News & World Report list puts OHSU at no. 3 for excellence in primary care education.. Fifty-five of our 121 fourth-year med students, or 46 percent, are entering residency in primary care this year, which includes internal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics. While many of these students will go on to sub-specialize, this continues to be a strong initial showing in primary care, compared to many other areas of the country. While this is down somewhat from 2011 when 62 percent matched to primary care, it is consistent with trends from 2008-2010.. Complete OHSU rankings include:. - Overall research #37 (tied with University of Maryland). - Primary care #3 (tied with UC-San Francisco). - Family Medicine #5 (tied with University of New Mexico). - Rural Medicine #12 (tied with eight other institutions)

It seems that Americans might not be the only ones to be at the receiving end of the thriving business of credit card fraud emanating from India. After the Maharashtra Police unearthed a massive credit card fraud scam by raiding Thane-based call centres and arresting scores of individuals accused of duping close to 6,000 Americans, Canadian authorities have raised alarm about 'suspicious phone callers with Indian accent.'

According to the probe agency, scores of Canadian residents have complained to the authorities in their country about marketers and callers asking them about their personal information. The complainants have also stated that most of the callers have an 'Indian accent' and tend to be pushy while asking personal information which mostly is about credit card details.

The revelation was made by some senior officials of the CBI who said that the issue was brought up during a recently held meeting with the Commissioner of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Bob Paulson.

"Several issues were discussed during the meeting and most of them focused on greater co-operation between Canadian and Indian investigating bodies. Some of the points discussed during the meeting were related to inquiries and judicial requests made by our agency in connection to criminal cases probed by CBI. While our Canadian counterpart assured better cooperation from their end, there were some issues raised by them in which they would be needing our assistance. One of them is of credit card fraud and the matter seems to be serious and urgent in nature,"a senior CBI official told DNA.

"According to the RMCP in the last few months there have been multiple complaints from Canadian citizens claiming that they have been receiving calls from people with an Indian accent. The numbers from which they have been receiving these calls seem to be originating from two-three countries and we intend to work with out Canadian counterparts to probe this matter further," the officer said.

According to CBI officials, as seen in the past, syndicates operating a credit card scam system, are generally not based out of any one particular country. Similarly the numbers from which these fraud calls are made can be concealed using commonly available technology or through sim cards acquired illegally by syndicate members.

Mumbai case

Thane based call centres, which had more than 2,000 employees, have come under police investigation for allegedly duping Americans by pretending to be Internal Revenue Service officials and threatening them with tax investigations if they did not pay up. The police has also issued a Look Out Circular (LOC) to nab Sagar Dharmesh Thakkar, the alleged mastermind of the scam which is believed to have procured almost rupees 500 crore from American citizens

Randomized Study to Evaluate the Impact of Telemedicine Care in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes With Multiple Doses of Insulin and Suboptimal HbA1c in Andalusia (Spain): PLATEDIAN Study.
To assess the impact of a telemedicine visit using the platform Diabetic compared with a face-to-face visit, on clinical outcomes, patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and physicians' satisfaction in patients with type 1 diabetes. PLATEDIAN (Telemedicine on Metabolic Control in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Andalusian Patients) (NCT03332472) was a multicenter, randomized, 6-month follow-up, open-label, parallel-group controlled study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes with suboptimal metabolic control (HbA1c <8% [<64 mmol/mol]), treated with multiple daily injections. A total of 388 patients were assessed for eligibility; 379 of them were randomized 1:1 to three face-to-face visits (control cohort [CC]) (n = 167) or the replacement of an intermediate face-to-face visit by a telemedicine visit using Diabetic (intervention cohort [IC]) (n = 163). The primary efficacy end point was the mean change of HbA1c levels from baseline to month 6. Other efficacy and safety end points were mean blood glucose, glucose variability, episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, patient-reported outcomes, and physicians' satisfaction. At month 6, the mean change in HbA1c levels was -0.04 ± 0.5% (-0.5 ± 5.8 mmol/mol) in the CC and 0.01 ± 0.6% (0.1 ± 6.0 mmol/mol) in the IC (P = 0.4941). The number of patients who achieved HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) was 73 and 78 in the CC and IC, respectively. Significant differences were not found regarding safety end points at 6 months. Changes in HRQoL between the first visit and final visit did not differ between cohorts, and, regarding fear of hypoglycemia (FH-15 ≥28), statistically significant differences observed at baseline remained unchanged at 6 months (P < 0.05). The use of telemedicine in patients with type 1 diabetes with HbA1c <8% (<64 mmol/mol) provides similar efficacy and safety outcomes as face-to-face visits.

NBC Universal is looking at “The View”-style talk shows with multiple hosts to possibly replace “The Meredith Vieira Show” as its ratings slump behind syndicated competitors, sources told Page Six. stars Tamar demographic — younger, more multicultural — to Meredith’s later-afternoon time slot.”. NBC has already tinkered with Vieira’s format in an effort to boost ratings.. The normally pretaped show was done live the week of Jan. 19, and has recently been featuring multiple guests to talk about topics like parenting and health.. Vieira recently had author Steve Santagati, former New York Giant Michael Clayton and TV host Steve Wilkos for a panel on “what your man really thinks.”. But other NBC insiders insist the network isn’t looking to replace Vieira just yet.. “With any show, you tinker with different things to see what works,” one source said, adding that the panel could become part of the program. A rep for Vieira’s show had no comment.

Springfield Partner Carole Lynch and Associate Denise M. Tremblay recently obtained summary judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiff, a former director of our client—the board of trustees of a municipal library—alleged that the Board violated his 1st Amendment rights (under 42 U.S.C. § 1983) by retaliating against him in pursuing termination of his employment and breached his contract of employment. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his claim for violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, M.G.L. c. 12, after receiving the motion for summary judgment. The judge ruled in favor of our client on the 1st Amendment claim on the grounds that the Board did not act under color of state law as its members were not “state actors.” In the alternative, the Court held that the Board was entitled to qualified immunity. The Court also entered judgment on the breach of contract claim.

Why mobile search was inevitable from 1997

Way back in May 1997, AOL finalized some amazing new technology based around its so called “OSCAR” protocolﾠwhich eventually became AOL’s flagship instant messaging system.

ﾠ

Why was this so amazing?

ﾠ

Well, it may seem something which we all take for granted in the new millenium, but at the time it was revolutionary for users to be able to communicate in real time. Furthermore, this was rolled out on a commercial scale and it proved to be a real game changer, not just for internet usage but also for broader human communication.

ﾠ

Early dominance

ﾠ

AOL’s Instant Messaging system became known simply as “AIM” and it completely dominated the market in the early 2000s. This tells us a number of things:

ﾠ

1. The developed world was eager to be able to communicate in real time, both for social and commercial reasons.

2. Business was desirous of shorter “feedback loops”, as a means of staff development and of shortening their sales cycles.

3. Collaboration in fields such as mathematics, science, education and politics became much easier, albeit creating at the same time some inherent risks.ﾠ

ﾠ

Demise

ﾠ

By 2009, however, use of AIM had largely become non-existent. This was due to a number of reasons:

ﾠ

1. Ageing technology: as processing speeds and the complexity of computing accelerated, so did demands on what was expected of AIM and its competition. New operating systems were tried, noteably the AOL XMPP Gateway. This allowsﾠthird party messaging networks to exchange messages and presence information with the AIM service. Use of the gateway is currently limited to select partners, and AOL state that parties interested in using the XMPP gateway should contact them.ﾠUse of AOL’s XMPP Gateway was and is governed by proprietary terms of service.ﾠCommercially, this was perceived as restrictive and gradually other solutions became more popular.

2. Portability: the advent of mobile phones with 3G rendered the need to be at an office or desktop unneccessary when wanting to instant message, whether by SMS or other means.ﾠ

3. Apple: Apple products surged in popularity, wiping many competitors off the map including this technology.

ﾠ

What next?

ﾠ

Looking back, it was clear that there was a desire for real time mobile communication technologies. It was inevitable, even in 1997, that technology would deliver solutions to this and the fascinating question now is how this trend will continue. It is not clear, however, that we have seen the last of AIM. Take a look at the following video for more details.

Channel 4 has appointed Alex Mahon, the former boss of the maker of MasterChef and Broadchurch, who now runs the special effects firm behind Hollywood blockbusters including Gravity and Guardians of the Galaxy, as its new chief executive.

Mahon becomes the first woman to run a UK broadcaster larger than Channel 5. She is the first female Channel 4 chief executive in the broadcaster’s 35-year history.

“Alex is an outstanding leader and a highly experienced chief executive who has developed and grown major international businesses in both the creative and technology sectors,” said the Channel 4 chairman, Charles Gurassa.

Jay Hunt quits Channel 4 post just days before decision on top job

“She brings an impressive combination of relevant experience and is brilliantly placed to help steer Channel 4 through the competitive challenges and opportunities ahead.”

Mahon will take over from David Abraham, who leaves later this year, and will immediately face the prospect of negotiations with the government over the relocation of Channel 4 out of London.

Scottish-born Mahon has previously worked closely with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, having served as a member of the advisory panel put together to help map out the future scope and remit of the BBC ahead of the renewal of its royal charter last year.

“She is a great enthusiast for Channel 4 and its unique public service remit and her recent work with government will be valuable in facilitating constructive dialogue with the new administration,” said Gurassa.

Mahon is expected to start the £900,000 a year job in October or November and will be involved with the appointment of Hunt’s successor.

Hunt is due to leave at the end of September, after handling the launch of Great British Bake Off which the broadcaster poached from the BBC last year.

“Channel 4’s unique remit to innovate and to appeal to young and diverse audiences make it an essential part of British culture,” said Mahon. “There is nowhere in the world like Channel 4 and, in these changing times, its mission is more important than ever. I’m incredibly proud to be joining Channel 4 and bring to it experience both of leading creative organisations at scale and dealing with an environment of constant technological change.”

Mahon joins from Foundry, a design and visual effects software firm with film credits including Guardians of the Galaxy and technology licensing deals with Hollywood heavyweights such as Disney, Weta Digital and Sony Pictures Imageworks, which she has run since 2015.

Calixarene Assisted Rapid Synthesis of Silver-Graphene Nanocomposites with Enhanced Antibacterial Activity.
Demonstrated herein is a single rapid approach employed for synthesis of Ag-graphene nanocomposites, with excellent antibacterial properties and low cytotoxicity, by utilizing a continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) process in combination with p-hexasulfonic acid calix[6]arene (SCX6) as an effective particle stabilizer. The nanocomposites showed high activity against E. coli (Gram-negative) and S. aureus (Gram-positive) bacteria. The materials were characterized using a range of techniques including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectrophotometry, FT-IR, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). This rapid, single step synthetic approach not only provides a facile means of enabling and controlling graphene reduction (under alkaline conditions) but also offers an optimal route for homogeneously producing and depositing highly crystalline Ag nanostructures into reduced graphene oxide substrate.

North American Single-footing Horse

The North American Single-footing Horse, also called the Single-footing Horse or Single-footer, is a horse breed originating in the southern United States. The term "single-foot" refers to an intermediate ambling gait, sometimes alternately called the rack or paso largo, where the horse lifts each foot up separately and puts it down alone.

Characteristics
The Single-footing Horse comes in a wide range of colors, including palomino and buckskin, as well as chestnut, gray, and bay.
The Single-footing Horse is a medium-sized breed of light riding horse. It is primarily known for its intermediate four-beat gait, which may range from 7 to 9 miles per hour on a trail ride to over 15 miles per hour at a road speed. High speeds in excess of 20 mph have been recorded.

Uses
The breed is almost always used for trail or pleasure riding. All Single-footers must be shod in plain keg shoes (a standard machine-made shoe) in order to maintain registration.

History
The Single-footing Horse is descended from crosses of American Saddlebreds, Standardbreds, and other gaited breeds, with some influence from Spanish bloodlines. An influential stallion was EZD Falcon Rowdy, who also influenced the Racking Horse breed.

breaks. . Swing the End of the World. Deep in the wilds of Ecuador is a seismic monitoring station known as Casa del Arbol (in the original Casa del Arbol). Its purpose is to observe the activity of the Tungurahua volcano, which is located nearby. This volcano woke up on August 19, 1999. Since then, climbing it has been banned, and it is under scrutiny. The station is a small tree house. Which can already be considered a landmark, since it is located on the edge of a fairly deep cliff. But much more interesting are the swings that hang from the branches of a tree, right next to the station (more like a large birdhouse). All over the world, these swings are known as “swings at the end of the world” or “end of the world” swings.

we used the metro but you have to change once. the pavements are not smooth if you have luggage on wheels and it is a good 5 minute walk with a bit of a hill, so takes a bit of effort.. There is a fantastic minibus service at the airport called Minibud. It took us directly to the hotel and collected us for the return. Literally door to door. The price was extremely reasonable and so convenient. Cannot recommend it enough.. we took a shuttle bus which was direct but we had a bit of a wait.. We booked the transfer with jet2.

We always have a great time when Branson joins us for our weekly Legend's dinner with Grammy & Pa. He's so full of personality and gets a long with both girls so well. :). We survived another first day of school! It was a pretty smooth morning, even Drew cooperated by sleeping most of the night and waking up to have breakfast with the girls! School is starting 10 minutes earlier than last year so we were up and at it at 6:30 to make sure we had enough time to park and walk the girls in...plus take pictures. Lots and lots of pictures!. Ava was pretty excited to go see her friends but I think as the time for leaving for school neared she got more and more nervous. She went from bubbly and talkative to a little more solemn. She did at least smile for a picture or two! :)
