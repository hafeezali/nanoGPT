Novel cytotoxic and biological agents for prostate cancer: where will the money be in 2005?
In 2004, docetaxel-based chemotherapy became the first treatment capable of extending life in androgen-independent prostate cancer. The era of therapeutic nihilism in this disease has thus been put to rest and a broad range of agents is being tested with the goal of improving on the successes of 2004. Lessons learned from other tumour types will need to be applied to prostate cancer in order to harness the bounty of available ideas. Target amplification or activating mutations and not merely the presence of a target are likely to be important to the success of targeted agents. Thus, the promise of the current crop of targeted agents is most likely to be realised when pursued in the context of well-credentialed targets and tested in highly translational clinical trials that are capable not only of assessing tumour response, but also of evaluating the status of the targeted pathway. The most promising agents in clinical development are reviewed.

An emerging clinical approach to treat substance abuse disorders involves a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy whereby addicts learn to reduce their reactivity to drug-paired stimuli through cue-exposure or extinction training. It is, however, unlikely that extinction training would be consistently effective as a stand- alone treatment in populations that have abused drugs long-term because the key memory systems that are recruited during extinction training are impaired by long-term drug use. There is a critical need to understand mechanisms underlying extinction learning and to establish viable strategies to increase the efficacy of extinction therapies for substance abuse disorders. Key elements of the proposed research plan build on recent advances made in the treatment of conditioned fear and anxiety and other cognitive disorders by pharmacological modulation of glycine, an obligatory co-transmitter at the NMDA glutamate receptor complex. The specific aims of the proposed research in rats and non-human primates are to: 1) elucidate the neurobiological substrates of extinction learning; 2) evaluate selected glycine site partial agonists and glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors as candidate pharmacotherapies to increase the efficacy of extinction training; and 3) determine neurobiological substrates of glycine site modulation of extinction learning. The intravenous cocaine self-administration procedure will be used in the proposed studies because the contingency between drug delivery and behavior is likely paramount for understanding the persistent abuse of drugs in people. Measurement of Fos protein expression (a marker for neuronal activation) and evaluation with anisomycin (an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis) will be used in rats to investigate the neurobiological substrates of extinction learning following cocaine self-administration training. In addition, the proposed research in rats and non-human primates will specifically investigate the effects of the partial glycine agonist D-cycloserine and selective GlyT1 inhibitors for their ability to accelerate extinction learning and to subsequently reduce cocaine cue reactivity and re-acquisition of cocaine self-administration. Animal research involving pharmacological modulation of learning and memory is well-served by an integrated comparative strategy using appropriately selected laboratory animals. This approach is especially relevant for research involving cognitive enhancing drugs, where non-human primates can serve as a key translational interface for the development of pharmacotherapies.

Host lymphodepletion augments T cell adoptive immunotherapy through enhanced intratumoral proliferation of effector cells.
T-cell adoptive immunotherapy for stringent murine tumor models, such as intracranial, s.c., or advanced pulmonary metastases, routinely uses lymphodepletive conditioning regimens before T-cell transfer, like recent clinical protocols. In this study, we examined whether host lymphodepletion is an obligatory component of curative T-cell therapy; we also examined the mechanism by which it augments therapy. Mice bearing intracranial, s.c., or 10-day pulmonary metastases of MCA 205 received total body irradiation conditioning or were nonirradiated before i.v. transfer of tumor-reactive T cells. Total body irradiation was not required for immunologically specific curative therapy and induction of memory provided that a 3- to 12-fold higher T-cell dose was administered. The mechanism involved enhanced intratumoral proliferation of T-effector cells in total body irradiation-conditioned recipients. In this tumor model, intratumoral T(reg) cells were not detected; consequently, intratumoral T-effector cells produced identical amounts of IFN-gamma upon ex vivo antigen stimulation irrespective of total body irradiation conditioning. Thus, host lymphodepletion augments T-cell immunotherapy through enhanced antigen-driven proliferation of T-effector cells, but curative therapy can be achieved in nonconditioned hosts by escalation of T-cell dose. These data provide a rationale for dose escalation of T-effector cells in situations where single or repeated lymphodepletion regimens are contraindicated.

Ranking systems have their limitations and imperfections – we know. Yet it’s worth sharing that the latest U.S. News & World Report list puts OHSU at no. 3 for excellence in primary care education.. Fifty-five of our 121 fourth-year med students, or 46 percent, are entering residency in primary care this year, which includes internal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics. While many of these students will go on to sub-specialize, this continues to be a strong initial showing in primary care, compared to many other areas of the country. While this is down somewhat from 2011 when 62 percent matched to primary care, it is consistent with trends from 2008-2010.. Complete OHSU rankings include:. - Overall research #37 (tied with University of Maryland). - Primary care #3 (tied with UC-San Francisco). - Family Medicine #5 (tied with University of New Mexico). - Rural Medicine #12 (tied with eight other institutions)

It seems that Americans might not be the only ones to be at the receiving end of the thriving business of credit card fraud emanating from India. After the Maharashtra Police unearthed a massive credit card fraud scam by raiding Thane-based call centres and arresting scores of individuals accused of duping close to 6,000 Americans, Canadian authorities have raised alarm about 'suspicious phone callers with Indian accent.'

According to the probe agency, scores of Canadian residents have complained to the authorities in their country about marketers and callers asking them about their personal information. The complainants have also stated that most of the callers have an 'Indian accent' and tend to be pushy while asking personal information which mostly is about credit card details.

The revelation was made by some senior officials of the CBI who said that the issue was brought up during a recently held meeting with the Commissioner of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Bob Paulson.

"Several issues were discussed during the meeting and most of them focused on greater co-operation between Canadian and Indian investigating bodies. Some of the points discussed during the meeting were related to inquiries and judicial requests made by our agency in connection to criminal cases probed by CBI. While our Canadian counterpart assured better cooperation from their end, there were some issues raised by them in which they would be needing our assistance. One of them is of credit card fraud and the matter seems to be serious and urgent in nature,"a senior CBI official told DNA.

"According to the RMCP in the last few months there have been multiple complaints from Canadian citizens claiming that they have been receiving calls from people with an Indian accent. The numbers from which they have been receiving these calls seem to be originating from two-three countries and we intend to work with out Canadian counterparts to probe this matter further," the officer said.

According to CBI officials, as seen in the past, syndicates operating a credit card scam system, are generally not based out of any one particular country. Similarly the numbers from which these fraud calls are made can be concealed using commonly available technology or through sim cards acquired illegally by syndicate members.

Mumbai case

Thane based call centres, which had more than 2,000 employees, have come under police investigation for allegedly duping Americans by pretending to be Internal Revenue Service officials and threatening them with tax investigations if they did not pay up. The police has also issued a Look Out Circular (LOC) to nab Sagar Dharmesh Thakkar, the alleged mastermind of the scam which is believed to have procured almost rupees 500 crore from American citizens

Randomized Study to Evaluate the Impact of Telemedicine Care in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes With Multiple Doses of Insulin and Suboptimal HbA1c in Andalusia (Spain): PLATEDIAN Study.
To assess the impact of a telemedicine visit using the platform Diabetic compared with a face-to-face visit, on clinical outcomes, patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and physicians' satisfaction in patients with type 1 diabetes. PLATEDIAN (Telemedicine on Metabolic Control in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Andalusian Patients) (NCT03332472) was a multicenter, randomized, 6-month follow-up, open-label, parallel-group controlled study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes with suboptimal metabolic control (HbA1c <8% [<64 mmol/mol]), treated with multiple daily injections. A total of 388 patients were assessed for eligibility; 379 of them were randomized 1:1 to three face-to-face visits (control cohort [CC]) (n = 167) or the replacement of an intermediate face-to-face visit by a telemedicine visit using Diabetic (intervention cohort [IC]) (n = 163). The primary efficacy end point was the mean change of HbA1c levels from baseline to month 6. Other efficacy and safety end points were mean blood glucose, glucose variability, episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, patient-reported outcomes, and physicians' satisfaction. At month 6, the mean change in HbA1c levels was -0.04 ± 0.5% (-0.5 ± 5.8 mmol/mol) in the CC and 0.01 ± 0.6% (0.1 ± 6.0 mmol/mol) in the IC (P = 0.4941). The number of patients who achieved HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) was 73 and 78 in the CC and IC, respectively. Significant differences were not found regarding safety end points at 6 months. Changes in HRQoL between the first visit and final visit did not differ between cohorts, and, regarding fear of hypoglycemia (FH-15 ≥28), statistically significant differences observed at baseline remained unchanged at 6 months (P < 0.05). The use of telemedicine in patients with type 1 diabetes with HbA1c <8% (<64 mmol/mol) provides similar efficacy and safety outcomes as face-to-face visits.

NBC Universal is looking at “The View”-style talk shows with multiple hosts to possibly replace “The Meredith Vieira Show” as its ratings slump behind syndicated competitors, sources told Page Six. stars Tamar demographic — younger, more multicultural — to Meredith’s later-afternoon time slot.”. NBC has already tinkered with Vieira’s format in an effort to boost ratings.. The normally pretaped show was done live the week of Jan. 19, and has recently been featuring multiple guests to talk about topics like parenting and health.. Vieira recently had author Steve Santagati, former New York Giant Michael Clayton and TV host Steve Wilkos for a panel on “what your man really thinks.”. But other NBC insiders insist the network isn’t looking to replace Vieira just yet.. “With any show, you tinker with different things to see what works,” one source said, adding that the panel could become part of the program. A rep for Vieira’s show had no comment.

Springfield Partner Carole Lynch and Associate Denise M. Tremblay recently obtained summary judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiff, a former director of our client—the board of trustees of a municipal library—alleged that the Board violated his 1st Amendment rights (under 42 U.S.C. § 1983) by retaliating against him in pursuing termination of his employment and breached his contract of employment. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his claim for violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, M.G.L. c. 12, after receiving the motion for summary judgment. The judge ruled in favor of our client on the 1st Amendment claim on the grounds that the Board did not act under color of state law as its members were not “state actors.” In the alternative, the Court held that the Board was entitled to qualified immunity. The Court also entered judgment on the breach of contract claim.

Why mobile search was inevitable from 1997

Way back in May 1997, AOL finalized some amazing new technology based around its so called “OSCAR” protocolﾠwhich eventually became AOL’s flagship instant messaging system.

ﾠ

Why was this so amazing?

ﾠ

Well, it may seem something which we all take for granted in the new millenium, but at the time it was revolutionary for users to be able to communicate in real time. Furthermore, this was rolled out on a commercial scale and it proved to be a real game changer, not just for internet usage but also for broader human communication.

ﾠ

Early dominance

ﾠ

AOL’s Instant Messaging system became known simply as “AIM” and it completely dominated the market in the early 2000s. This tells us a number of things:

ﾠ

1. The developed world was eager to be able to communicate in real time, both for social and commercial reasons.

2. Business was desirous of shorter “feedback loops”, as a means of staff development and of shortening their sales cycles.

3. Collaboration in fields such as mathematics, science, education and politics became much easier, albeit creating at the same time some inherent risks.ﾠ

ﾠ

Demise

ﾠ

By 2009, however, use of AIM had largely become non-existent. This was due to a number of reasons:

ﾠ

1. Ageing technology: as processing speeds and the complexity of computing accelerated, so did demands on what was expected of AIM and its competition. New operating systems were tried, noteably the AOL XMPP Gateway. This allowsﾠthird party messaging networks to exchange messages and presence information with the AIM service. Use of the gateway is currently limited to select partners, and AOL state that parties interested in using the XMPP gateway should contact them.ﾠUse of AOL’s XMPP Gateway was and is governed by proprietary terms of service.ﾠCommercially, this was perceived as restrictive and gradually other solutions became more popular.

2. Portability: the advent of mobile phones with 3G rendered the need to be at an office or desktop unneccessary when wanting to instant message, whether by SMS or other means.ﾠ

3. Apple: Apple products surged in popularity, wiping many competitors off the map including this technology.

ﾠ

What next?

ﾠ

Looking back, it was clear that there was a desire for real time mobile communication technologies. It was inevitable, even in 1997, that technology would deliver solutions to this and the fascinating question now is how this trend will continue. It is not clear, however, that we have seen the last of AIM. Take a look at the following video for more details.

Channel 4 has appointed Alex Mahon, the former boss of the maker of MasterChef and Broadchurch, who now runs the special effects firm behind Hollywood blockbusters including Gravity and Guardians of the Galaxy, as its new chief executive.

Mahon becomes the first woman to run a UK broadcaster larger than Channel 5. She is the first female Channel 4 chief executive in the broadcaster’s 35-year history.

“Alex is an outstanding leader and a highly experienced chief executive who has developed and grown major international businesses in both the creative and technology sectors,” said the Channel 4 chairman, Charles Gurassa.

Jay Hunt quits Channel 4 post just days before decision on top job

“She brings an impressive combination of relevant experience and is brilliantly placed to help steer Channel 4 through the competitive challenges and opportunities ahead.”

Mahon will take over from David Abraham, who leaves later this year, and will immediately face the prospect of negotiations with the government over the relocation of Channel 4 out of London.

Scottish-born Mahon has previously worked closely with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, having served as a member of the advisory panel put together to help map out the future scope and remit of the BBC ahead of the renewal of its royal charter last year.

“She is a great enthusiast for Channel 4 and its unique public service remit and her recent work with government will be valuable in facilitating constructive dialogue with the new administration,” said Gurassa.

Mahon is expected to start the £900,000 a year job in October or November and will be involved with the appointment of Hunt’s successor.

Hunt is due to leave at the end of September, after handling the launch of Great British Bake Off which the broadcaster poached from the BBC last year.

“Channel 4’s unique remit to innovate and to appeal to young and diverse audiences make it an essential part of British culture,” said Mahon. “There is nowhere in the world like Channel 4 and, in these changing times, its mission is more important than ever. I’m incredibly proud to be joining Channel 4 and bring to it experience both of leading creative organisations at scale and dealing with an environment of constant technological change.”

Mahon joins from Foundry, a design and visual effects software firm with film credits including Guardians of the Galaxy and technology licensing deals with Hollywood heavyweights such as Disney, Weta Digital and Sony Pictures Imageworks, which she has run since 2015.

Calixarene Assisted Rapid Synthesis of Silver-Graphene Nanocomposites with Enhanced Antibacterial Activity.
Demonstrated herein is a single rapid approach employed for synthesis of Ag-graphene nanocomposites, with excellent antibacterial properties and low cytotoxicity, by utilizing a continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) process in combination with p-hexasulfonic acid calix[6]arene (SCX6) as an effective particle stabilizer. The nanocomposites showed high activity against E. coli (Gram-negative) and S. aureus (Gram-positive) bacteria. The materials were characterized using a range of techniques including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectrophotometry, FT-IR, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). This rapid, single step synthetic approach not only provides a facile means of enabling and controlling graphene reduction (under alkaline conditions) but also offers an optimal route for homogeneously producing and depositing highly crystalline Ag nanostructures into reduced graphene oxide substrate.

North American Single-footing Horse

The North American Single-footing Horse, also called the Single-footing Horse or Single-footer, is a horse breed originating in the southern United States. The term "single-foot" refers to an intermediate ambling gait, sometimes alternately called the rack or paso largo, where the horse lifts each foot up separately and puts it down alone.

Characteristics
The Single-footing Horse comes in a wide range of colors, including palomino and buckskin, as well as chestnut, gray, and bay.
The Single-footing Horse is a medium-sized breed of light riding horse. It is primarily known for its intermediate four-beat gait, which may range from 7 to 9 miles per hour on a trail ride to over 15 miles per hour at a road speed. High speeds in excess of 20 mph have been recorded.

Uses
The breed is almost always used for trail or pleasure riding. All Single-footers must be shod in plain keg shoes (a standard machine-made shoe) in order to maintain registration.

History
The Single-footing Horse is descended from crosses of American Saddlebreds, Standardbreds, and other gaited breeds, with some influence from Spanish bloodlines. An influential stallion was EZD Falcon Rowdy, who also influenced the Racking Horse breed.

breaks. . Swing the End of the World. Deep in the wilds of Ecuador is a seismic monitoring station known as Casa del Arbol (in the original Casa del Arbol). Its purpose is to observe the activity of the Tungurahua volcano, which is located nearby. This volcano woke up on August 19, 1999. Since then, climbing it has been banned, and it is under scrutiny. The station is a small tree house. Which can already be considered a landmark, since it is located on the edge of a fairly deep cliff. But much more interesting are the swings that hang from the branches of a tree, right next to the station (more like a large birdhouse). All over the world, these swings are known as “swings at the end of the world” or “end of the world” swings.

we used the metro but you have to change once. the pavements are not smooth if you have luggage on wheels and it is a good 5 minute walk with a bit of a hill, so takes a bit of effort.. There is a fantastic minibus service at the airport called Minibud. It took us directly to the hotel and collected us for the return. Literally door to door. The price was extremely reasonable and so convenient. Cannot recommend it enough.. we took a shuttle bus which was direct but we had a bit of a wait.. We booked the transfer with jet2.

We always have a great time when Branson joins us for our weekly Legend's dinner with Grammy & Pa. He's so full of personality and gets a long with both girls so well. :). We survived another first day of school! It was a pretty smooth morning, even Drew cooperated by sleeping most of the night and waking up to have breakfast with the girls! School is starting 10 minutes earlier than last year so we were up and at it at 6:30 to make sure we had enough time to park and walk the girls in...plus take pictures. Lots and lots of pictures!. Ava was pretty excited to go see her friends but I think as the time for leaving for school neared she got more and more nervous. She went from bubbly and talkative to a little more solemn. She did at least smile for a picture or two! :)

I have two boys who race BMX.. we travel all over for their me races and it’s become a lifestyle for our family. There is a lot of down time and the weapon of choice has been the mini bikes for several years. The first mini bike I purchased was a very well known brand and it seemed to perform well. However - I stared noticing other brands making minis that seemed equal in quality but about half the price. So when it came time to replace the bike I went with the cheaper less known brand of mini. I didn’t notice and difference in quality between the two brands. About month ago I saw a kid kit one of the races cruising the pits on a mini that looked nothing like I’d seen before. I figured some rich Factory dad had somehow found the parts to build a custom mini.. just be taking a quick glance it was obvious this mini was top of the line . Later I was able to find out it was not a custom build.. it was a Wildcat MIni that he purchased complete . The bike was similiar in price ronthe more welll known brand of mini sold in the U.S. I decided to purchase the bike and if has exceeded all’s expectations. Its smoother, faster and I would argue nicer looking then any other mini out there. My sons both love riding these bikes over anything else the have - including their race bikes which which both cost over 2k to build. You can find mini’s cheaper then Wildacat- but if they are gonna be riding a lot and you want a top notch bike this is the best there is and I’ve seen several. Until a new company emerges that can do better - wildcat is without the best bang for your buck and I will certainly be buying another Willscat once it’s time to replace the two we have now -

WOW Nathan - thank you so much for such a comprehensive review on the Wildcat Original 1B.
We really appreciate it. We strive to be the market leader in the development of Mini BMX bikes - we want our pride to be riding the best, the lightest and the strongest.

Tiny and tough! Super fun! I wish they existed when I was a kid! My little groms and I love it! Here’s a couple pics of myself playing with our new Mini freak. I’m 175 and this thing is as tough as my 20” bike and is a rush to ride! Well done to the wildcat crew for sending this gap in the in the market for young riders and adults alike. Tiny shred!!!

That’s the absolute best Edward. We love seeing dads get in on the action. Thanks for your positive review and so pleased that you and your little groms are diggin it.

[Development of direct phlebography for surgical intervention of the varix cruris].
To determine the appropriate treatment for patients with varix cruris, we performed three different methods of phlebography including direct phlebography, and compared their findings by each phlebography. Conventional ascending phlebography was taken routinely and initially in all limbs (n = 120). "Direct phlebography" developed by us was then indicated, when the visualization of the deep vein system was unclear by conventional ascending phlebography. This method was useful for the clear opacification of the deep vein system, and also was able to visualize the deep femoral vein clearly. After the precise diagnosis of varix cruris, descending phlebography under the Valsalva maneuver at supine position was carried out for the evaluation of the deep vein insufficiency. According to these phlebographic findings, conventional stripping with or without sub- or suprafascial ligation of communicating vein was indicated to saphenous typed varix cruris. The valvuloplasty to the highest valve in superficial femoral vein was carefully added in eight limbs which showed the significant reflux by added in eight limbs which showed the significant reflux by the descending phlebography. This valvuloplasty was remarkably contributed to the immediate healing of the stasis ulcer without recurrence. And compression sclerotherapy was selected to some patients with branch typed varix cruris.

BRUSSELS -- European Union ambassadors appear set to prolong asset freezes and visa bans against 146 individuals and 37 entities that, according to the EU, are responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity.

EU sources have told RFE/RL that the decision to prolong the measures by six months will be taken ahead of a September 15 deadline without much discussion.

The targets of the sanctions include companies in Crimea and various battalions formed by the Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, as well as Russian politicians like Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and Dmitry Kiselyov, a state media executive and presenter whom many regard as the Kremlin's chief propagandist.

The sanctions were first introduced in March 2014 after Russia's seizure and illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.

The EU's economic sanctions that target Russia's energy, military, and financial sectors are up for renewal on January 31.

EU sources told RFE/RL that those sectoral sanctions will be discussed at a Brussels summit of EU leaders in October.

Removal of the distal 75% of the pancreas may be done in adults without producing diabetes or deficiency of external pancreatic secretion. This procedure is often employed in the treatment of malignant and benign tumors. Resection of the body and tail of the pancreas may also be useful in treatment of an occasional patient who sustains severe trauma to the pancreas with complete transection, or with a crushing injury involving the distal portion of this organ. Little data are available, however, concerning the effect of extensive pancreatic resection upon the young, growing individual. Although such a procedure does not result in the development of diabetes, the quantitative requirements for exocrine secretion during the phase of rapid growth have not been established. This experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of distal subtotal pancreatectomy on the growth and metabolism of young mice.. Material and Methods. Ninety C-3-H mice, each 4.

The study of graphs, or graph theory, is used in communications and information technology systems for various purposes. A graph refers to a collection of nodes (or vertices) and a collection of edges that connect pairs of nodes. A dominating set DS for a graph G is a set of nodes in G such that every node not in DS is joined to at least one member of DS by some edge. That is, each node in G is either a member of the dominating set DS or 1 hop away from a member node (may also be referred to as a dominating node). It is noted that a dominating set may include disjoint sets of nodes in the graph.
A connected dominating set (CDS) of a graph G includes a dominating set and a set of connecting nodes that may be needed to connect disjoint nodes in the dominating set. CDSs have traditionally been used in mobile ad-hoc networks for routing applications. For instance, broadcast and multicast protocols may efficiently reach all destinations by restricting transmissions to nodes that are members of the CDS (instead of every node in the graph). In addition to routing, mobile ad-hoc networks may benefit from CDSs in other areas including channel access, link adaptation, energy consumption, power control, dynamic resource management and the like.
Since a given graph may have more than one CDS, it may be beneficial to identify a CDS with minimum number of elements (e.g., nodes and/or edges). Such a CDS may be referred to as a minimum connected dominating set (MCDS). However, it has been shown that the computation complexity of minimum connected dominating set problem (MCDS), and minimum dominating set problem (MDS) in general, is NP-complete. Therein lies a need for a system and method capable of efficiently identifying a CDS with the number of elements as close to the minimum number as possible.

Characterization and technological properties of Staphylococcus xylosus strains isolated from a Tunisian traditional salted meat.
The technological properties of strains of Staphylococcus xylosus were studied to select the most suitable for use as starter cultures for the production of dried fermented meat products. Strains of S. xylosus were isolated from traditional salted Tunisian meat and were identified by biochemical and molecular methods. Thirty strains of S. xylosus were studied to evaluate their catalase, nitrate reductase, lipolytic, proteolytic and antibacterial activities as well as growth ability at different temperatures, pH's and NaCl concentrations. All strains of S. xylosus had catalase activity and were able to reduce nitrates to nitrites. The nitrate reductase activity increased when the strains were kept under anaerobic conditions. Proteolytic activity on milk and on gelatin agar was demonstrated for 100% and 83.3% of the S. xylosus isolates, respectively. However extracellular proteolytic activity as assessed by the azocasein method was poor in all the strains. Lipolytic activity as assessed by the agar method showed that 76.6% of strains of S. xylosus could hydrolyze Tween 20 against 33.3% that could hydrolyze tributyrin. Tween 80 was hydrolyzed by only 10% of strains. Strains of S. xylosus hydrolyzed pork fat better than beef and lamb fat. The majority of strains had antibacterial activity against Salmonella arizonae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis.

Mobility means synching up

If you’re an IT executive today, things pretty much work this way: so very often when you get a present from a family member, it’s the latest in mobile computing devices. In fact, most executives in this business are already carrying wireless handheld devices alongside a two-way pager and a cell phone.

Of course, I personally can’t wait to have my own version of a Dick Tracy watch, which means that just about anybody will be able to contact me whenever they take a notion to do so. But the fundamental problem with mobile computing is the need for such a concept – apart from existing IT services, that is.

To make matters worse, companies such as Verizon now are giving away free Internet-enabled phones to people willing to sign long-term contracts. L.M. Ericcson Telephone Co., meanwhile, is working with AT&T Corp. to create a new generation of wireless consumers by giving away wireless devices shaped like phones, allowing people to win prizes by interacting with the Who Wants to be a Millionaire television program.

The reason this represents such an immense problem for IT is that all these executives are sure they can’t live without such devices. Naturally, this means they want the devices connected to their work environments so that they can become ever more productive.

What most people don’t realize is that this presents a huge challenge for IT. Each mobile device on the market today comes with its own set of built-in services for e-mail and calendering. In order to integrate those services with existing corporate services built around Lotus Development Corp.’s Notes or Microsoft Corp.’s Exchange, IT organizations have to invest in synchronization software that can be purchased from more than a dozen different vendors today.

The problem is that every time one of the devices this software is intended to synchronize gets updated, the synchronization software needs to be updated. And of course anytime any of the core enterprise applications gets an upgrade, you’ll also need to update the synchronization software.

For IT people, this creates an infinite synchronization loop that diverts attention away from their real jobs: to make sure that their company has a working IT infrastructure. This loop exists because the concept of mobile computing has not yet sufficiently worked its way into our application development and Internet infrastructure psyche. Instead of having to purchase synchronization software to make the concept of mobile computing a reality, the technology needed to support mobile computing should be built directly into the applications we use and the services provided by ISPs.

Unfortunately, we’re a good two years away from seeing this approach become a reality, so in the meantime we can expect to see continued proliferation of mobile computing products that just add to the problem.

Alas, trying to put a lid on this phenomenon is roughly akin to the effort back in the 1980s of trying to stop the infiltration of PCs into corporate environments. The reality is that you can’t stop people when it comes to acquiring the latest gadget in an economy where people have far too much disposable income. And if you don’t try to support it, end-users will once again view the IT department as a behind-the-times bottleneck that prevents them from attaining data nirvana alongside their latest stock quotes.

So the best thing you can do for the moment is make a short-term investment in synchronization software because you will have some modicum of control. Nevertheless, IT organizations should also be putting a tremendous amount of pressure on ISVs and ISPs to create truly seamless mobile computing infrastructures.

After all, it’s in their interest to do so. Once we have such platforms, everybody can participate. Until then, mobile computing will just remain a troublesome niche application for those who can afford to pay for it.

The only question that remains is, how long are we going to have to live with mobile solutions that only take us part of the way there?

yorkshire pudding.. breakfast and dinner version..

i am a huge huge cheer's fan.. it's one of my all time favorite shows.. and one my favorite characters was cliff clavin, the under appreciated, hapless loser mail carrier.. one episode cliff explains yorkshire pudding to the cheer's gang here. and i have always remembered his "explanation" now i have since learned it was bogus but that was part of cliff's charm he made crap up and lead you to believe it was fact.. kind of like when i tell shell or jake "well you know i read on the internet... blah blah" and shell calls me out every time.. she says "MOM YOU CAN NOT QUOTE PEREZ HILTON as a legitimate source of facts.. {head hanging in shame} i can't help it.. he wouldn't put anything on his web site that wasn't true right?? right?? helloooooo **tapping on computer screen** right?? well enough with my gullibility.. when i was a kid, well 9th grade, i stayed my friend kathy's house all the time and we made this for breakfast every time!! we would sit with our warm "oven pancake" and smear jam on it and watch american bandstand.. {ok i don't know if we watched american bandstand we probably watched smurfs but hey i have an image to uphold here..} any way when my mom and i would go to lawry's prime rib house {i've mentioned before my fondness for that place} they always served with their prime rib a yorkshire pudding.. theirs were individual so they were more like a pop over, now i could have, i repeat, could have made individual ones, you see my mother in law gave me a pop over pan once.. {very nice of her huh} and well it was big and bulky and so i moved out to my cabinet in the garage.. if you've been reading this blog for any amount of time you have heard me tell my tales of woe about putting things in the garage.. pete donates them!! right out of my cabinet.. {he doesn't anymore because i threatened to clean out the garage one day and donate his crap..} so you guessed it.. he donated my pop over pan.. *sigh* so i had to make one big one.. nevertheless it was yummy and decadent and delicious.

preheat your oven to 425 degrees {f}... ladle your pan drippings from your roast into a large iron skillet {or put your butter in a large iron skillet} now add your "drippings/butter" to the oven to get hot ..just a few minutes.. meanwhile make your batter.. sift your flour and salt together.. add your eggs and milk and whisk until thoroughly combined.. add your pepper {don't add pepper if making for breakfast} and quickly incorporate.. remove drippings/butter from oven and pour batter right until the hot drippings/butter.. put in oven and cook for 12-15 minutes until puffy and lightly brown.. remove from oven and serve hot.. when serving for dinner i like to put my meat right on top of it.. when serving for breakfast i like to serve it with raspberry jam.. yummy!!!

kaotic kitchen

my little space on the net for recipes and thoughts... i should start off by saying I am not a blogger, this is, shall we say, a journal of sorts for my recipes and random thoughts now and again, to be shared with family and friends. my cooking philosophy is simple, if the recipe has too many ingredients I won't cook it, too many pots and pans required I won't do it, sandwiches DO NOT constitute dinner. I cook simple, quick and easy meals.

about me

I have had a love for cooking since I was young.. well ok at first it wasn't a love it was my "chore." but love came later.. When I turned 16 my Mother started me reading recipes on Sunday and then picking 2 or 3 from her cook books or magazines and then preparing a grocery list from the recipe (which today I am lost if I don't have my detailed list for my trip to the store) from my list I would then clip coupons and I would head off to the grocery store.. As an incintive (I always need incintives and money works wonders *smile*) I was allowed to keep any money I saved from the coupons and she would then pay me per meal I made. I had to cook at leaast 2 a week but if wanted more money I would cook more, the prices ranged from $5.00 for simple meals such as tacos and refried beans (no canned in my house) or $15.00 for something like Chicken Cacciatore (because it takes so much longer but is so much worth it). So when I got married and got a house of my own I was able to conquer the grocery store and cooking delicious meals. um thanks Mom?

What’s The Forecast On Kepler-7B? Hot And Cloudy

by

October 01, 201311:02 AM

Scientists are reasonably sure that it’s a cloudy day on , a planet that orbits its star about 1,000 light-years away from us.

Using NASA’s orbiting space telescopes, researchers publishing in say that for the first time they’ve been able to make a rudimentary map of the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet.

The team used faint visible light and infrared reflections from Kepler-7b to make their cloud map.

“By observing this planet with Spitzer and Kepler [telescopes] for more than three years, we were able to produce a very low-resolution ‘map’ of this giant, gaseous planet,” study co-author Brice-Olivier Demory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge said in a statement.

Governments love to blame international forces beyond their control for economic ills at home. Gordon Brown was a dab hand at this. But when a boom which involved a tripling of debt and house prices ends in a bust should we really be surprised? And could the governments of Spain and the UK not have stepped in to end the excesses long before their economies got addicted to debt? I think so and let us hope they don't let booms get carried away again although looking at both countries the next boom seems an awfully long way off.

The Indians have placed righty Corey Kluber on the 10-day DL with lower back discomfort, per a team announcement. He’ll be replaced for the time being by righty Joe Colon.

Kluber has reportedly been dealing with the back issue throughout the early portion of the season, so it seems the hope is that some rest will help him move past it. He has struggled somewhat thus far, perhaps due in part to the nagging discomfort.

Though Kluber is still carrying a strong 9.9 K/9 on the year, he has allowed more walks (3.1 BB/9) than usual and has coughed up seven long balls through 37 1/3 innings. His velocity has dropped a bit, with his four-seamer sitting at 91.5 mph and his sinker averaging 92.1 mph.

Literacy Notes
The 2013 Literacy Directors’ Retreat
Literacy directors from throughout
the state met to exchange ideas at
Oklahoma’s annual literacy directors’
retreat. For the second year in a row,
the retreat theme was inspired by an
old I Love Lucy television episode
featuring Lucy and Ethel working
in a chocolate factory. A morning
brainstorming session had directors
comparing new tutors to Lucy and
Ethel’s chocolate wrapping experi-ence.
What was the consensus? Unlike
Lucy and Ethel’s humorous work
practices, volunteer tutors are suc-cessful
when they receive adequate
training, on-going supervision, and
regular feedback. Interspersed be-tween
fun activities, program direc-tors
also discussed fund raising, adult
learner book clubs, health literacy,
and techniques to deal with stress.
The retreat was made possible thanks
to Library Services and Technology
Act funds from the Institute of Mu-seum
and Library Services.
[Left to right] Ida Fay Winters describes the health literacy project in Altus. • Rebecca Barker shares ideas on using high interest
reading materials. • Jana Smithey (Elk City) and other literacy directors try to balance a hula hoop during team building exercise.

Q:

What is the actual role of ZooKeeper in Kafka 2.1?

I have seen some similar questions as follows:
www.quora.com/What-is-the-actual-role-of-Zookeeper-in-Kafka-What-benefits-will-I-miss-out-on-if-I-don%E2%80%99t-use-Zookeeper-and-Kafka-together
Is Zookeeper a must for Kafka?
But I want to know the latest information about this question.
What is the actual role of ZooKeeper in Kafka 2.1?

A:

Zookeeper is required to run a Kafka Cluster.
It is used by Kafka brokers to perform elections (controller and topic leaders), to store topic metadata and various other things (ACLs, dynamic broker configs, quotas, Producer Ids)
Since Kafka 0.9, clients don't require access to Zookeeper, only brokers rely on it.

We need to keep America the world's greatest magnet for immigrants. Why? Today, more and more people around the globe have access to the same technological tools for innovation and entrepreneurship. In such a world, the countries that make it easy to draw in human talent will have a distinct advantage. Also, a steady flow of immigrants keeps a society flexible and competitive. The more open your society is to new people and ideas, the more things will be done by you, not to you. We shouldn't just welcome educated immigrants, but laborers as well. Immigrants keep energy flowing in America's veins. But because I strongly favor immigration, I also favor a high fenceif not a physical one, then at least a tamper-proof national I.D. card for every American, without which you could not get a legal job or access to government services. We will not sustain a majority in favor of flexible immigration if we can't control our borders. Good fences make good immigration policy.. Thomas L. Friedman [4/5/06]

Tin Top Bridge. Tin-Top Bridge. Hyde Hall, East Springfield, New York. This bridge was completed in 2011 and provides access to Hyde Hall from Tin Top through its Mill Road entrance. The existing culvert, which replaced the original bridge in the early 20th century, washed out in June 2006.

Pfizer announced that the final analysis results show its COVI-19 vaccine is 95% effective in preventing infections, even to elderly, and caused no serious side effects, the company said Wednesday.. The company is preparing to formally ask U.S. Food and Drug Administration to allow emergency use of the vaccine. The announcement came after as coronavirus cases in the US skyrocketed and other parts of the world, giving hopes for an end to the pandemic.. .. Earlier this week, competitor Moderna Inc. also announced 94.5% effectiveness of its own COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which is made with the same, brand-new technology — using a snippet of the genetic code of the coronavirus to train the body to recognize if the real virus comes along.

Sir,. Condoleeza Rice's statement on claims that the US has transported prisoners to be tortured in foreign states and in secret prison camps is the height of sophistry.. It sickens me that the US administration, which claims to lead the world in human rights, is quibbling over legalisms with far greater consequence than President Clinton's manoeuvres over oral sex with Monica Lewinsky.. Ms Rice claims that near-drowning of terrorist suspects, or the causing of pain near but not equivalent to organ failure, is not torture.. If our Prime Minister is to prevent any further damage to the UK's global reputation and safety against future terrorist attacks, he must utterly repudiate such claims.. Dr Ian Brown. London WC1

Monika Kořínková and Barbora Šimková debuted their first collaboration together with the 'Pierot Porcelain Tableware Collection.' The home accessory range evokes a sense of minimalism and tradition and consists of cups, saucers, bowls and vases.. In creating the set, the duo wanted to "bring back a certain culture of dining." The elegant tableware is meant to help people take a break from their busy lives through dining experiences. Also, a tradition of tableware aesthetics has also been diminishing, with less people investing in finer porcelain dishes.. The Pierot collection features a soft color palette with light gold accents. Some of the pieces were achieved through the act of recycling old shapes of tableware -- inspired by porcelain decor and vintage cut glass.. Eccentric Porcelain Dishware. Score.

Don?. Hi, I think it is very refreshing that you have decided to keep some of your precious life private. I myself am in the process of writing lifestyle blogs and launching a new babywear product and as a naturally private person was also contemplating how much of my life I would need to disclose in order to be a successful blogger. I know that part of blogging means opening up and sharing parts of your life with the world so that they can relate with you, however I also believe there needs to be a balance between being able to capture and experience personal moments that only you and your family share with moments that will inspire or positively influence someone else out there in the wide world! Good luck with your new parenting life and business ventures. 😊

"Let’s be honest here – we love to snack as much as anyone. Why else would we start our own snack company? One bite will have you saying MMM-MMM. And when you discover they are also heart-healthy, you might say HMMMMM? Good for you AND tasty? How did they do that?

For starters, all of our chips are made with plant sterols and have been proven to lower cholesterol. We use only heart-healthy oils, plus other great ingredients like whole oats and whole grains (our tortilla chips) and a frying process that helps our potato chips have 40% less fat than regular potato chips.

Now doing something good for your heart is as easy as opening a bag of Corazonas heart-healthy chips!"

Equestrian lessons. Dressage is the execution, by a trained horse, of precision movements in response to barely perceptible signals from its rider. Dressage harmoniously develops the physique and ability of both the horse and rider.. Cleland’s equestrian lessons are for riders from beginner to advanced level who are aspiring to ride competitively and become world-class dressage or show-jumping equestrians. These lessons are intensive and are aimed towards riders who have already undertaken or would like to begin equestrianism as an athletic sport.. Our equestrian lessons are coached by FEI Level 2 Coach and FEI World Dressage Final Silver and Bronze Medalist Akoele Roachford. Akoele was trained in both dressage and showjumping in Germany. She has trained many students to a level where they were able to acquire full and partial equestrian scholarships to universities in the USA.. All Equestrian lessons are private lessons, lasting between 45 minutes to 1 hour, and will be scheduled to your convenience.

Democracy and Economic Growth. Date2012-05-23. Author. Uslu, Hakan. Type of Degreethesis. DepartmentEconomics. MetadataShow full item record. Abstract. A common theorem of political economists is that democracy and income are strongly correlated. There are conflicting views on the direction of the causality. Coups that started due to non- economic reasons are shocks to democracy. I use such coups to test the hypothesis that democracy causes high economic development. My results suggest that anti-democratic coups have a significant negative effect on economic development. On the other hand, democracy has a strong positive effect on economic development. This study focuses on how an anti-democratic change in regime influences the income level in a country.. Files. - Name:. - thesis_final_21May2012.pdf. - Size:. - 480.4Kb

About Scott Walker. Scott Walker is the 45th and current Governor of Wisconsin. He also served in the Wisconsin State Assembly and as the Milwaukee County Executive. He was recently elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association. First elected governor in the 2010 Wisconsin general election and was reelected governor in the 2014 Wisconsin gubernatorial election. The response to Walker’s policies included protests at the Wisconsin State Capitol and an effort to recall Walker. Walker introduced a budget plan which limited the collective bargaining of most Wisconsin public employees. Walker survived the 2012 recall election, becoming the first American governor to survive a recall effort. Walker was a candidate for his party’s nomination to the 2016 presidential election but left early in the contest..

If it matters, as a customer /user, I'd rather forego all my data on their

than have Garmin pay the ransom.

According to this TC article, it's basically illegal for a company to pay the
ransom:

The village is served by Poppleton railway station on the Harrogate Line. According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 1,961, increasing to 1,997 at the 2011 Census.  Before 1996, it was part of the Borough of Harrogate.

The name is derived from popel (pebble) and tun (hamlet, farm) and means "Pebble Farm" because of the gravel bed upon which the village was built. Upper Poppleton has been referred to as "Land Poppleton" and the neighbouring village of Nether Poppleton as "Water Poppleton" indicating their position relative to the river.

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles. It became a Conservation Area in 1993.

History
In 972, the village was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles as "Popeltun" and in the Domesday Book as "Popeltune". The villages and lands were given by Osbert De Arches to the Abbot of St Mary's in York. It was, therefore, under the ecclesiastical rule of the Parish of St Mary-Bishophill Junior.

During the reign of Richard II the village was the scene of the murder of a Mayor of York.

In 1644 the 25,000 strong Scottish and Parliament Armies, led by the Earl of Manchester, laid siege to the city of York. To facilitate communications, they built a "Bridge of Boats" at Poppleton. This bridge was eventually taken by Prince Rupert and his Royalist Forces, but he subsequently lost the battle at Marston Moor.

The village benefitted from the growth in the railways in the 19th century, when the York, Knaresborough and Harrogate Railway routed their line through Poppleton and erected a station.

Governance
Upper Poppleton lies within the Rural West Ward of the City of York Unitary Authority. As of the 2011 elections it is represented by Councillors Ian Gillies, Paul Healey and Chris Steward who are all members of the local Conservative Party. It is also a part of the UK Parliamentary Constituency of York Outer as well as the EU region of Yorkshire and the Humber.

Locally there is a Parish Council with eight council members.

Economy
The Poppletons were formerly agricultural settlements with many farms, but the modern village is mostly a dormitory for commuters to the nearby towns and cities. It has benefited from its good road and rail links. The village has local retail facilities, including a Post Office, and some small enterprises.

Demography
In the 19th century the population has varied between 284 and 346. The census of 2001 recorded the population as 1,961.

Community
There are two allotment sites in the village of Upper Poppleton. One is located at the end of Beech Grove and the other is in Main Street next to the Library. There are eight allotments on the Beech Grove Allotments, each approximately 300 square metres. The land is owned by the Parish Council. Main Street Allotments have seven plots.

There is a Youth Club and Scout Troop in the village.

Education
In 1797, local ironmonger John Dodsworth founded a Church of England School. This was converted into accommodation for the School Master when a new building was built in 1850. As of 2010 Poppleton Ousebank Primary provides primary education for both Poppletons.

For secondary education, the village is in the catchment area of York High School on Cornlands Road in nearby Acomb, though the nearest secondary school is Manor CE on Millfield Lane. Manor is a Church of England School and has its own admissions policy separate from the local City Council. It was originally built in 1813 at Kings Manor and has moved several times before being sited in Millfield Lane.

Transport

Harrogate Coach Travel buses run past the village as part of the York to Ripon route.

First York buses operate in the village as part of the Nether Poppleton route to York/Stamford Bridge. Transdev York buses operate in the village, as part of the Nether Poppleton route to York/Stamford Bridge, As well as through the village, as part of the Askham Bar/Acomb to Clifton Moor/Monks Cross/University route. Eddie Brown buses run past the village as part of the York to Boroughbridge/Ripon route.

A Park and Ride (Poppleton Bar) was constructed by the A59 in 2015, with Park and Ride buses (route 59) running from Poppleton to York centre, generally every ten minutes.

Northern Rail operates a stopping service on the line between York and Leeds via Harrogate. Poppleton station is the first station after York.

Religion

The old Norman 'Chapel of All Hallows' in Upper Poppleton was demolished in 1890 to make way for the Victorian Church of All Saints. The 'new' church was designed by Hodgson Fowler of Durham.

In 1866, the two Poppleton Parishes were united to form the Parish of Nether Poppleton with Upper Poppleton. All Saints' Church is situated on The Green in Upper Poppleton.

The present Methodist Chapel on the Green replaced two previous buildings on the site built in 1817 and 1819 respectively.

Sports
Poppleton United 1st XI play in York Football League Premier Division, as of 2010, and play next to the Community Centre on Main Street. The 2nd XI play in Reserve Division C. Poppleton Tigers Junior Football Club is located in Nether Poppleton, but serves both villages.

There is a Lawn Tennis Club with artificial and all weather courts in Main Street. As of 2010 the Men's 1st and second team play in Division One of the Tyke Petroleum Tennis League and the 3rd team play in Division Six. The Ladies 1st team also compete in the Ladies section of the same League, with the 1st team playing in Division One, the 2nd team in Division Three and the 3rd team in Division Three as of 2010. They also enter five teams in the Mixed Section in Divisions One, Two, Six Eight and Eleven.

Orienteering in Tilgate Forest. Published on 05/02/20. Despite the squelchy and swamp-like conditions at the regional orienteering event in Tilgate Forest, the two members of the Claremont Fan Court School orienteering squad made the journey to Crawley and completed their courses in impressive fashion.. On the 2.7 km orange course, Thomas F navigated steadily, with no significant errors, and was very pleased to finish in 49:53 for 8th place. Ellis B, on his first outing this year, sped round the 2 km yellow course to finish in first place in the excellent time of 21:35. After his best result so far, Ellis is looking forward to moving up to the orange course at Ashdown Forest.

State leaders continue to rail against federal tax plan

The tax overhaul plan proposed by President Donald Trump and now being considered in Congress would end the deduction on federal income tax forms for state and local property taxes. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said it would disproportionately harm New Yorkers, where property taxes are among the highest in the nation, and he’s taken opportunities at recent public events to make the case against the plan.

WBFO Albany Correspondent Karen DeWitt reports.

Cuomo called the plan unfair “double taxation.” If New Yorkers are not allowed to deduct their state and local taxes, they essentially would be taxed twice – once by state and local governments and again by the federal government on earnings that they already paid in the form of taxes to the state and local governments. He estimated it would cost New York $17.5 billion a year.

“This is like upside-down world,” Cuomo said on Oct. 5 on Long Island. “It’s called a tax cut plan. It’s really a tax increase for most New Yorkers.”

Cuomo predicted that getting rid of the deduction also would ruin the state’s business climate, which is already struggling in some regions.

“It is an attempt by the federal government, purposeful or coincidental, to make New York and several states actually less competitive for businesses,” Cuomo said on Oct. 3 in New York City.

The governor is not alone in his opposition. Fellow Democrats, including State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, also are worried. DiNapoli said recently that he’s “very concerned” about the effects of eliminating the deduction.

“For a high-tax state like New York, state and local tax deductibility has been a very important component of the federal tax code,” said DiNapoli, who added that even with a proposed higher standard deduction, it’s still not a “win” for New York taxpayers.

DiNapoli and Cuomo have conducted separate studies showing that New Yorkers give over $40 billion more in taxes to the federal government than the state gets back, an imbalance that has doubled in recent years.

U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is New York’s senior senator and the Senate minority leader, said it’s not just New Yorkers who will be adversely affected. Schumer said one-third of total taxpayers in the United States, or about 44 million, currently take the state and local tax deductions. He recently released data showing that people in states like Georgia, a Republican stronghold, and Colorado also would be affected.

“The effect of removing state and local deductibility is deep and wide,” Schumer said. “And I think it’s going to alone kill the Republican plan as it is.”

Schumer predicted that the elimination of the deduction eventually will be dropped from the plan. He said he was involved in the last successful tax overhaul in the 1980s. He said the deduction was ultimately kept in the plan because it would have adversely affected too many lawmakers’ constituents.

Several Republican congressmen and women in New York already have said they are against getting rid of the state and local property tax deductions, including John Faso of the Hudson Valley and Peter King of Staten Island. Seven GOP members, including Claudia Tenney and John Katko, both of central New York, and Elise Stefanik of the North Country, wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, asking him to reconsider.

Cuomo said if the final plan includes the elimination of the deduction, he’ll go to court to stop it.

True molecular solutions of natural cellulose in the binary ionic liquid-containing solvent mixtures.
Evidence is presented for the first time of true molecular dissolution of cellulose in binary mixtures of common polar organic solvents with ionic liquid. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, small-angle neutron-, X-ray- and static light scattering were used to investigate the structure of cellulose solutions in mixture of dimethyl formamide and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. Structural information on the dissolved chains (average molecular weight ∼ 5 × 10(4)g/mol; gyration radius ∼ 36 nm, persistence length ∼ 4.5 nm), indicate the absence of significant aggregation of the dissolved chains and the calculated value of the second virial coefficient ∼ 2.45 × 10(-2)mol ml/g(2) indicates that this solvent system is a good solvent for cellulose. More facile dissolution of cellulose could be achieved in solvent mixtures that exhibit the highest electrical conductivity. Highly concentrated cellulose solution in pure ionic liquid (27 wt.%) prepared according to novel method, utilizing the rapid evaporation of a volatile co-solvent in binary solvent mixtures at superheated conditions, shows insignificant cellulose molecular aggregation.

Employers cannot force employees to retire at 65 without a clear justification in each case after a ruling by the UK’s Supreme Court yesterday.. Five justices ruled that Leslie Seldon, a partner in a Kent firm, had not been treated unfairly when compulsorily retired at 65. But they sent his case back to the employment tribunal to consider whether the mandatory age of 65, in the circumstances of the law firm, was a “proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aims of the partnership”.. The ruling sets out new guidance for firms and companies, making clear they can force employees to

Q:

Is there a tool for windows that creates formula-pictures out of a text-formula

I am looking for a tool that would batch process text-files containing formulas (possibly latex style) and convert them into a gif/png/jpg. Since I want to do a batch conversion, the tool ideally runs in cmd.exe.
What I need is probably possible with a latex installation (MiKTeX comes to mind), but if not absolutely necessary, I don't want to install 100MB+ for my need.
Is there such a tool?

A:

The "best" solution for quality is to use a full LaTeX installation, and then generate images via command line with e.g. mathTeX.
From my answer to a similar (but not duplicate, imho) question here at Super User:

MathTeX, licensed under the gpl, is a cgi program that lets you easily embed LaTeX math in your own html pages, blogs, wikis, etc. It parses a LaTeX math expression and immediately emits the corresponding gif (or png) image, rather than the usual TeX dvi. So just place an html  tag in your document wherever you want to see the corresponding LaTeX expression.

It can either be used as a CGI script on the server and linked directly from the <img> tag, or run on the command-line to generate standalone image files. From the homepage:

mathTeX is usually run by your web server as a cgi program, obtaining its input expression from the query-string of an html  tag. But you can also run mathTeX from your Unix shell, supplying all input on the command line. For example, ./mathtex.cgi "x^2+y^2" –o equation1   renders an image of x^2+y^2 in file equation1.gif.

There is actually a related project called mimeTeX that sounds more or less exactly like what you want, even though the quality is said to not be as good as with a full LaTeX installation solution as mathTeX uses, and it can naturally not handle all LaTeX cases without a LaTeX installation.
Like mathTeX, it is made primarily with webservers in mind, but in the same way, it can be run from the command line. You don't specify OS, which often indicates Windows, and compilation instructions for Windows are available on the project page linked earlier.

EDIT: I noted that the mimeTeX page provides pre-compiled binaries for Windows as well, under §5.1. Just download that and follow the instructions, as any regular Windows program. If you are on e.g. Debian or Ubuntu, both mimeTeX and mathTeX are part of the main repository.

What's the best way to laying out a brochure (trifold) 8.5" x 11" using InDesign?. Where is your problem? Why not start to work?. A trifold needs to have the fold-in panel slightly smaller in width than the other 2 panels. The paper thickness determines the appropriate panel size, but for general purposes, 1/16 inch smaller for the fold-in should suffix.. For referencing the pages of a trifold, use this numbering scheme: front 5-6-1 and back 2-3-4.. You can lay this out with two 11 x 8.5 pages OR 6 single pages arranged in a group of 1-2-3 and 4-5-6. Using the 6 single page method requires a version of Indesign that allows modifying page sizes. NOTE: you can set up 3 equal size panels, but this can create a folding issue.. To achieve the 1/16 inch smaller panel, create guides/pages with the following widths: [front 3.625 - 3.6875 - 3.6875] and [back 3.6875 - 3.6875 - 3.625]

.. As a result of Mkhitaryan’s aforementioned demands, Thomas Tuchel’s side would have to sell him this summer itself in order to avoid losing him for free next year. And because of that, Arsenal now have the chance of signing the player for a bargain price of just £20m!. Mkhitaryan, who is widely regarded as one of the most technically gifted players of his position, in Europe, was in scintillating form for his club last season during the course of which he scored 23 goals and provided 32 assists in 52 appearances. He may prove to be a massively useful signing for the Gunners, going by his capability to play as a winger and an attacking midfielder and the amount of big stage experience that he possesses, and may complement the likes of Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez pretty well.

Zinc(II) complexes of the second-generation quinolone antibacterial drug enrofloxacin: Structure and DNA or albumin interaction.
Zinc mononuclear complexes with the second-generation quinolone antibacterial drug enrofloxacin in the absence or presence of a nitrogen donor heterocyclic ligand 1,10-phenanthroline or 2,2'-bipyridine have been synthesized and characterized. Enrofloxacin is on deprotonated mode acting as a bidentate ligand coordinated to zinc ion through the ketone and a carboxylato oxygen atoms. The crystal structure of bis(enrofloxacinato)(1,10-phenanthroline)zinc(II), 2, has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The biological activity of the complexes has been evaluated by examining their ability to bind to calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) with UV and fluorescence spectroscopies. UV studies of the interaction of the complexes with DNA have shown that they can bind to CT DNA and the DNA binding constants have been calculated. Competitive studies with ethidium bromide (EB) have shown that the complexes exhibit the ability to displace the DNA-bound EB indicating that they bind to DNA in strong competition with EB for the intercalative binding site. The complexes exhibit good binding propensity to human and bovine serum albumin proteins having relatively high binding constant values.

Rapid response to budesonide (Pulmicort) inhaled via the Nebuhaler in asthmatic children.
Acute reversible airways obstruction in children, especially those aged under one year, who may respond poorly to inhaled beta 2-stimulants, is difficult to treat in general practice. In an open study, 48 episodes in 29 children, half aged under one year, were treated with budesonide (Pulmicort) 0.1-2.09 mg used to charge a Nebuhaler fitted with a facemask. In 45 instances, clinical improvement was observed, and with doses of 0.8 mg and above, this usually occurred within 10 minutes. This study suggests that budesonide via a suitable delivery system can evoke rapid improvement in reversible airways obstruction in young children.

Q:

How to Extract people's last name start with "S" and first name not start with "S"

As the title shows, how do I capture a person who:

Last name start with letter "S"
First name NOT start with letter "S"

The expression should match the entire last name, not just the first letter, and first name should NOT be matched.
Input string is like the following:

(Last name) (First name)
Duncan, Jean
Schmidt, Paul
Sells, Simon
Martin, Jane
Smith, Peter
Stephens, Sheila

This is my regular expression:
/([S].+)(?:, [^S])/

Here is the result I have got:

Schmidt, P
Smith, P

the result included "," space & letter "P" which should be excluded.
The ideal match would be

Schmidt
Smith

A:

You can try this pattern: ^S\w+(?=, [A-RT-Z]).
^S\w+ matches any word (name in your case) that start with S at the beginning,
(?=, [A-RT-Z]) - positive lookahead - makes sure that what follows, is not the word (first name in your case) starting with S ([A-RT-Z] includes all caps except S).

The primary field of application for this invention is guidance of unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles. In such applications it is common practice to compute a guidance command that results in a rate of turn that depends on a measurement of heading error. Both the measurement and the command are with respect to an inertial coordinate frame of reference. The guidance command is received and acted upon by a system (commonly referred to as an autopilot or stability augmentation system), which in turn sends commands to the vehicles servos and/or reaction control devices. This results in a movement of the vehicle's control surfaces, or vectors the thrust produced by the vehicle's propulsion system, or turns on-and-off a reaction control system, or a combination of such means of vehicle control. However vehicles respond to servo command relative to the medium through which they move, and when that medium is also in motion, then the rate of turn that is achieved depends nonlinearly on the speed and direction of the medium through which the vehicle is moving. This dependence can result in degraded or even unstable responses to the guidance system command, particularly for vehicles whose speed relative to the medium is not far greater than the speed of the medium itself (e.g. guided parafoils and underwater vehicles).
One approach to this problem is to sense the vector motion of the vehicle relative to the medium through which it is moving as well as its inertial velocity vector. By differencing these two quantities, one can compute the inertial velocity of the medium and provide a correction to the guidance command for that motion. However this requires incorporating devices that sense the vehicle's vector relative motion, which are not normally a part of the existing guidance and control system design. Such sensors in an aircraft are often referred to as an air data system.

Deep brain stimulation of globus pallidus internus in a 16-year-old boy with severe tourette syndrome and mental retardation.
A 16- year-old boy with long-standing severe Tourette syndrome (TS) and mental retardation, non-responsive to complex pharmocological and behavioural treatment was selected for bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Pre-operative and post-operative Yale Tourette syndrome scale (YTSS) scores and several other scores were used to quantify the effect of DBS up to one year follow-up. Although subscores of the YTSS improved, the overall outcome of chronic GPi-DBS showed no substantial therapeutic effect. This finding is in contrast to markedly improved TS of the only two adolescent TS patients in whom DBS has been performed so far. In this article we discuss possible reasons for the poor therapeutic effect of GPi-DBS in our patient contributing to the on-going debate on DBS inclusion criteria for adolescent TS patients.

For a long time, simply proving the existence of exoplanets was a big deal. We had over a hundred years of fiction and even non-fiction based on the assumption that our universe is absolutely packed with alien planets — but we simply couldn’t prove that they existed. Now, with the list of planets outside our solar system ballooning by dozens or more at a time, the stakes are quite a bit higher. Simply finding and identifying exoplanets is no longer enough to impress, and now you have to actually learn something about them. That’s been the goal of a team from MIT, which this week publishes a piece detailing their pioneering new method for looking at alien weather.

That’s much easier said than done, however, for many of the same reasons that it took so long to confirm the existence of exoplanets in the first place: they are very small and very dark. Most exoplanets have been confirmed thanks to so-called “transit” in front of their parent star, producing a blown-own planetary silhouette. Astronomers have worked to pull much more useful data from these transits than simple size and speed, and this MIT paper represents a major step toward that goal. By looking at the fluctuations in any light spilling around the edges of an alien world, these researchers can gain some insight into its atmosphere. Particularly, the team can derive some real information about the clouds that sit on top of this atmosphere.

The technique starts with a climate model that uses predicted pressure values to predict how different substances will behave on the surface of a given planet. This gives the team a mixture of gaseous products to model, and the software then looks at how these gasses might interact on the surface of an alien world with particular properties. The software spits out a prediction for the spectrographic readings we’d expect to be associated with each of these possible cloud formations. After that, all they need to do is compare their actual readings to the list of predictions — if any of the values fits observation too well to be coincidence, that’s probably our culprit.

The team used Kepler 7b as a test bed for its technique, and their readings suggest that the planet has clouds made of vaporized rock. On Earth these substances would be solid, or at most liquid near the planet’s interior. However Kepler 7b is absolutely gargantuan (one reason it was one of the first five confirmed exoplanets) and orbits less than a twentieth of as far from its star as the Earth does from Sol; sometimes referred to as a “hot Jupiter,” Kepler is a nightmarish furnace to make Venus look hospitable.

NASA’s TESS mission could make even these findings look tame.

These incredible rock-clouds are just another bullet point on the list of reasons exoplanetologists have the coolest scientific conferences. Their results often read like the ramblings of a science fiction author, narrating a magellan-like voyage through a universe far too surreal to ever actually exist. Worlds have been shown to rain diamond, or simply to be composed almost entirely of it. Others have multiple sunsets or abnormally long or short years. Astronomers have found planets that are several times older than our Sun, and others that are younger than our upright ancestors. The search for alien planets is the search for the edges of what’s possible, and techniques like this one are proving that we are very far from finding them.

While Kepler was mankind’s first tailored planet hunter, NASA is already well underway on its successor: the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. TESS should take our understanding of exoplanets to a new level, and unlike many areas of astronomy, in this case the tinier the detail of the observation the more relatable it is to the average person. It’s hard to imagine a super-Jupiter, but easier to imagine clouds. Exoplanetology will almost certainly be one of the most publicly lauded areas of astronomy in years to come.

Guanethidine-induced adrenergic sympathectomy augments endoneurial perfusion and lowers endoneurial microvascular resistance.
Chronic administration of guanethidine sulfate in the rat induces a selective adrenergic neuropathy. We studied the effects of guanethidine-induced adrenergic sympathectomy on rat sciatic nerve blood flow (NBF), microvascular resistance (MR), vessel caliber and norepinephrine (NE) content. A control group of animals was studied following chronic administration of mammalian Ringer's solution. NBF and MR were measured with an endoneurial microelectrode, using the technique of hydrogen clearance (HC). Following HC, the sciatic nerve was perfused with India Ink, removed, frozen and sectioned. Measurements were made of endoneurial microvessel numbers, diameter, circumference and area. The contralateral sciatic nerve was removed for measurements of NE content. In guanethidine-treated animals we observed elevated NBF, reduced MR and dilated microvessels. Numbers of microvessels and fascicular areas were similar to controls. NE content was markedly reduced following sympathectomy. These studies suggest that NBF, unlike cerebral blood flow (CBF), is regulated by its adrenergic input. Removal of adrenergic innervation of the vasa nervorum appears to result in a loss of tonic vasoconstrictive action.

Lapis Lazuli Mens Rings. Add-ons have become favored by both men and women, the factors why they choose all of them are very different. Ladies would you like to look great as well as want their outfits becoming completed because of the jewellery they wear. Using this into consideration, a woman will usually use the proper earrings, necklaces or bracelets in line with the garments she has opted for.. Men conversely don’t have equivalent factors because the ladies. They could in addition look at the advantages they will have so far as the appearance are worried, however they are additionally into showing their energy and status. Regardless of what they might be using or even for exactly what occasion, males whom like using jewellery will do therefore simply because they would also like to deliver an email.

Going forward with such team can give you enormous benefits and can end up with the worth hiring service.

I'm using a knoppix live cd (recommended by uni) to compile and run c programs off a usb drive - practice makes perfect. I get compile error messages when not done properly, warning messages, etc which is good. But when I try to run the program nothing happens. So for example, to compile test.c (which displays a simple printf statement), I would type:. $ gcc -o test test.c. Then to run the program, I type:. $ test. And nothing happens. It just goes to the next line, ready to take in another command. Why?

Development Strategy and Feasibility Study of Income Generation Projects in Machakhela National Parks. Commissioned by UNDP, the Goal of the project was to identify potential income generation projects for Machakhela National Park and prepare technical and economic feasibility analysis regarding the selected projects, evaluate the risks associated with the implementation of the projects in terms of their impact on environment and biodiversity and provide relevant risk mitigation strategy. Except that, the impact assessment of new road to Chakvistavi village on Mtirala National Park was included as the part of the project. The main purpose of the impact assessment was to identify actions to maximize benefits for the NP and mitigate potential negative impacts caused by increased number of visitors due to improved access.

Regardless of the amount by which personal lending increases, what is important is the availability of help for those who get themselves into difficulty, and we may see an increase in the number of people in difficulty if interest rates rise towards the end of the year. I know that that would cause pain to a great many of our constituents, so it is important to get the system right now.

With a supportive FCA framework already in place, a fairly minor amendment to the Bill could effectively set a fee structure that would activate the provision of free debt management plans by authorised firms. I hope that my Front-Bench colleagues agree that action is needed soon, and that the Bill represents a timely vehicle for the necessary change.

I believe this to be a truly cross-party issue, and that the Bill needs to be amended to give people in debt more security and access to free, high-quality plans that help them to manage their finances. If interest rates do go up any time soon, the debt management sector may be called on to give even more support than it provides now, and this is therefore a good time to strengthen the system.

Establishment of a turkey cecal cell line and development of turkey coccidia within the cells.
Cells were dispersed from cecal tissues of 1- to 2-day-old turkeys using a mixture of collagenase and dispase to enrich for epithelial cells. The initial culture produced from these cells (TCC) appeared to be heterogeneous, but, as the cells were cultured through 25 passages, they assumed a more fibroblastic appearance. Cellular invasion of the TCC by two species of turkey coccidia, Eimeria adenoeides and Eimeria meleagrimitis, was not enhanced, as compared with invasion in turkey kidney cells (TKC), the cell culture system standardly used to study the avian coccidia in vitro. However, early development by one of the species, E. meleagrimitis, was markedly increased in the TCC (Passages 6 through 19) over that in TKC. Thirty to 42% of the parasites that invaded the TCC developed beyond the sporozoite stage, as compared with 5% development in TKC. Mature first-generation schizonts were observed within 24 hr postinoculation in the TCC, but not until 48 hr in the kidney cells. There was no evidence that development of the second generation was initiated in either the TCC or kidney cells.

Five years ago, Bruce R. Spector was a partner in a little Washington cable TV company when he thought he saw the future. And for all the breathless whiz-bang hype of the Information Age, it wasn't cable.. Humble as it seemed -- and as pitiful a financial shape as it was in after a series of failed or struggling leveraged buyouts -- Spector and partner Joseph L. Mathias IV decided the future was radio. Based on that insight, they launched Benchmark Communications, a Baltimore company they hope to take public later this year, one that an industry peer says could be worth up to $160 million.. Benchmark has been on an acquisition spree since Congress approved the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which let companies such as Benchmark own many more stations in the same radio markets. This month alone, it has bought six stations to bring its total to 33, all in the southeastern United States, in small cities where the company can avoid such giant players as Westinghouse Electric Corp.

When I first started diving, I experienced quite a bit of motion sickness. It would never be a problem before a dive, but it would be a real problem upon surfacing. I would feel nauseaus at the surface and on the boat, and the feeling would slowly fade once back on land.. I learned a few tricks to minimize motion sickness. Medication probably helped the most, but I also ate better and drank more water. I also chugged a special soda immediately before diving; the soda contains an acid that counters motion sickness.. Over time, I noticed that my motion sickness decreased. I would dive unprepared, which is to say I hadn’t taken the medication or drank the soda, but I would feel relatively well after the dive.. I still take all precautions before a dive, just in case. However, it seems that the body adapts and naturally becomes less susceptible to motion sickness over time.. Good tips for combating motion sickness while diving!

Health Care In The Suburbs: An Analysis Of Suburban Poverty And Health Care Access.
There are 16.9 million Americans living in poverty in the suburbs-more than in cities or rural communities. Despite recent increases in suburban poverty, the perception of the suburbs as areas of uniform affluence remains, and there has been little research into health care barriers experienced by people living in these areas. The objectives of this study were to compare patterns of insurance coverage and health care access in suburban, urban, and rural areas using national survey data from 2005 to 2015 and to compare outcomes by geography before and after the Affordable Care Act took effect. We found that nearly 40 percent of the uninsured population lived in suburban areas. Though unadjusted rates of health care access were better in suburban areas, compared to urban and rural communities, this advantage was greatly reduced after income and other demographics are accounted for. Overall, a substantial portion of the US population residing in the suburbs lacked health insurance and experienced difficulties accessing care. Increased policy attention is needed to address these challenges for vulnerable populations living in the suburbs.

Title III Ruling to Effect Real Estate Market? 3 Experts Weigh In

Friday marked a big win for entrepreneurs and the everyday consumer when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted 3-1 for the next step in equity crowd funding. The approval of Title III of the JOBS Act is a long-awaited ruling that has both experts and consumers talking about the impact it will have on our country's economy—and the real estate market.

Once the ruling goes into effect, companies can be financed by anyone with the cash to opt in, without undergoing the public registration process. This is a huge move, as it's the first time in the history of the SEC (that's 82 years!) that retail investors---otherwise known as your everyday joe--will be able to invest in private businesses.

So how will this impact the real estate market? Below, three industry experts weigh in on what the ruling will mean for our economy, and the $2.5 billion real estate crowdfunding industry.

Scott Picken, author of Property Going Global and CEO and founder of Wealth Migrate, the 10th largest global real estate crowdfunding platform.“I don’t believe there is going to be a catalytic change overnight, but this will have a catalytic affect in the long term. The bottom line is that the wealth gap, the difference between the have’s and the have not’s, is the greatest challenge we have on the planet, and it is only getting worse. Now with technology and this change in legislation, the bottom 99 percent will have the same access to the same opportunities and partners as the top 1 percent. What most people don’t understand is that this will have a big impact in America, but a far greater impact in the emerging world. This is going to change the real estate industry forever and also put a case forward to a global change in legislation.”Marshall Saunders, co-founder and managing partner of SaundersDailey, a real estate crowdfunding platform connecting investors to residential real estate opportunities in select markets throughout the Midwest.“[The ruling] is not as wide open and accepting of non-accredited investors as I had hoped for. But it's a start. We will make the best out of the rules and will consider it a toe in the door. With good results, and consumer demand, we will see that door opening wider and wider in the coming years. The bottom line is that non-accredited investors now have a way of participating in equity crowdfunding. It will change the way America invests, both in business startups and real estate. The wait has been hard, but understandable. The U.S. Congress has no idea the magnitude of what it was dumping on the SEC when it passed the JOBS Act in 2012. Given that fact, the SEC has done the best that they can to move this forward.”

“Title III was never intended to have a competitive impact on the established markets. By design it's intended to enable entrepreneurs and real estate sponsors that have had difficulty raising much-needed capital from traditional channels to be able to do so more efficiently from individual investors, which is precisely what it will facilitate and make a meaningful impact on for those that access this new ecosystem.”

Only time will tell exactly how Title III will impact real estate, but it seems as if times are changing, 3-1.

Top 3 Best Android Fashion Apps Reviews

Top 3 Best Android Fashion Apps Reviews : The Internet has now changed the way we think about fashion. There was a time when people had to search the market physically and roam around all day just to buy a scarf or a pair of jeans, but now, things have changed to a whole another level. Now, everything that you want is just a search away.

Now, you can not only buy stuff online, in fact, you can also keep yourself updated about the latest fashion trends in the world. It’s just amazing how we have all the access to fashion now, you just type a word and your screen gets bombarded with results and sites that are waiting for so long to be explored by you.

Now, if you are a fashionista who loves to buy things online and keep herself updated about the latest fashion trends in the world then you are at the right place, reading the right article. Today we are going to jot down some of the best Android fashion apps that have the best quality stuff to buy, and some of them even have a blog section where you can learn a lot about styling yourself according to a particular event or weather.

Etsy

Etsy App

Etsy is one of the best and the most used fashion apps in the world because it has literally millions of things that you can buy just with a click. This application is for free which is again the best part, and you just have to pay the money for the stuff you buy on it. Etsy comes with everything that makes you a fashionista. From jewelry to clothes to furniture and home decor etc, here you will find each and everything. There’s even a search engine on this app where you just type an item that you are looking for and Etsy will bring the results of it to you within seconds.

The Hunt

Hunt App

A marketplace just like Etsy but a little more advanced and helpful because here people can even post stuff and use it as a blog. Most of the times, what happens is that a person uploads a picture of an item asking for the different prices from people who have already bought it, and then these other people help the buyers in getting a cheaper version of the same thing. You can say that this application also allows you to compare prices for products so that you end up spending the right money on the right item. There are a few downsides to this application, and that is the presence of bugs, but on the other hand you won’t find any other fashion community like the one that’s present on the Hunt. This is why you should always read reviews of a site or a product before buying it from sites like Top Reviews Site. This can help you get a clearer idea of what you are spending your money and time on.
