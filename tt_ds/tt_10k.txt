Novel cytotoxic and biological agents for prostate cancer: where will the money be in 2005?
In 2004, docetaxel-based chemotherapy became the first treatment capable of extending life in androgen-independent prostate cancer. The era of therapeutic nihilism in this disease has thus been put to rest and a broad range of agents is being tested with the goal of improving on the successes of 2004. Lessons learned from other tumour types will need to be applied to prostate cancer in order to harness the bounty of available ideas. Target amplification or activating mutations and not merely the presence of a target are likely to be important to the success of targeted agents. Thus, the promise of the current crop of targeted agents is most likely to be realised when pursued in the context of well-credentialed targets and tested in highly translational clinical trials that are capable not only of assessing tumour response, but also of evaluating the status of the targeted pathway. The most promising agents in clinical development are reviewed.

An emerging clinical approach to treat substance abuse disorders involves a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy whereby addicts learn to reduce their reactivity to drug-paired stimuli through cue-exposure or extinction training. It is, however, unlikely that extinction training would be consistently effective as a stand- alone treatment in populations that have abused drugs long-term because the key memory systems that are recruited during extinction training are impaired by long-term drug use. There is a critical need to understand mechanisms underlying extinction learning and to establish viable strategies to increase the efficacy of extinction therapies for substance abuse disorders. Key elements of the proposed research plan build on recent advances made in the treatment of conditioned fear and anxiety and other cognitive disorders by pharmacological modulation of glycine, an obligatory co-transmitter at the NMDA glutamate receptor complex. The specific aims of the proposed research in rats and non-human primates are to: 1) elucidate the neurobiological substrates of extinction learning; 2) evaluate selected glycine site partial agonists and glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors as candidate pharmacotherapies to increase the efficacy of extinction training; and 3) determine neurobiological substrates of glycine site modulation of extinction learning. The intravenous cocaine self-administration procedure will be used in the proposed studies because the contingency between drug delivery and behavior is likely paramount for understanding the persistent abuse of drugs in people. Measurement of Fos protein expression (a marker for neuronal activation) and evaluation with anisomycin (an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis) will be used in rats to investigate the neurobiological substrates of extinction learning following cocaine self-administration training. In addition, the proposed research in rats and non-human primates will specifically investigate the effects of the partial glycine agonist D-cycloserine and selective GlyT1 inhibitors for their ability to accelerate extinction learning and to subsequently reduce cocaine cue reactivity and re-acquisition of cocaine self-administration. Animal research involving pharmacological modulation of learning and memory is well-served by an integrated comparative strategy using appropriately selected laboratory animals. This approach is especially relevant for research involving cognitive enhancing drugs, where non-human primates can serve as a key translational interface for the development of pharmacotherapies.

Host lymphodepletion augments T cell adoptive immunotherapy through enhanced intratumoral proliferation of effector cells.
T-cell adoptive immunotherapy for stringent murine tumor models, such as intracranial, s.c., or advanced pulmonary metastases, routinely uses lymphodepletive conditioning regimens before T-cell transfer, like recent clinical protocols. In this study, we examined whether host lymphodepletion is an obligatory component of curative T-cell therapy; we also examined the mechanism by which it augments therapy. Mice bearing intracranial, s.c., or 10-day pulmonary metastases of MCA 205 received total body irradiation conditioning or were nonirradiated before i.v. transfer of tumor-reactive T cells. Total body irradiation was not required for immunologically specific curative therapy and induction of memory provided that a 3- to 12-fold higher T-cell dose was administered. The mechanism involved enhanced intratumoral proliferation of T-effector cells in total body irradiation-conditioned recipients. In this tumor model, intratumoral T(reg) cells were not detected; consequently, intratumoral T-effector cells produced identical amounts of IFN-gamma upon ex vivo antigen stimulation irrespective of total body irradiation conditioning. Thus, host lymphodepletion augments T-cell immunotherapy through enhanced antigen-driven proliferation of T-effector cells, but curative therapy can be achieved in nonconditioned hosts by escalation of T-cell dose. These data provide a rationale for dose escalation of T-effector cells in situations where single or repeated lymphodepletion regimens are contraindicated.

Ranking systems have their limitations and imperfections – we know. Yet it’s worth sharing that the latest U.S. News & World Report list puts OHSU at no. 3 for excellence in primary care education.. Fifty-five of our 121 fourth-year med students, or 46 percent, are entering residency in primary care this year, which includes internal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics. While many of these students will go on to sub-specialize, this continues to be a strong initial showing in primary care, compared to many other areas of the country. While this is down somewhat from 2011 when 62 percent matched to primary care, it is consistent with trends from 2008-2010.. Complete OHSU rankings include:. - Overall research #37 (tied with University of Maryland). - Primary care #3 (tied with UC-San Francisco). - Family Medicine #5 (tied with University of New Mexico). - Rural Medicine #12 (tied with eight other institutions)

It seems that Americans might not be the only ones to be at the receiving end of the thriving business of credit card fraud emanating from India. After the Maharashtra Police unearthed a massive credit card fraud scam by raiding Thane-based call centres and arresting scores of individuals accused of duping close to 6,000 Americans, Canadian authorities have raised alarm about 'suspicious phone callers with Indian accent.'

According to the probe agency, scores of Canadian residents have complained to the authorities in their country about marketers and callers asking them about their personal information. The complainants have also stated that most of the callers have an 'Indian accent' and tend to be pushy while asking personal information which mostly is about credit card details.

The revelation was made by some senior officials of the CBI who said that the issue was brought up during a recently held meeting with the Commissioner of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Bob Paulson.

"Several issues were discussed during the meeting and most of them focused on greater co-operation between Canadian and Indian investigating bodies. Some of the points discussed during the meeting were related to inquiries and judicial requests made by our agency in connection to criminal cases probed by CBI. While our Canadian counterpart assured better cooperation from their end, there were some issues raised by them in which they would be needing our assistance. One of them is of credit card fraud and the matter seems to be serious and urgent in nature,"a senior CBI official told DNA.

"According to the RMCP in the last few months there have been multiple complaints from Canadian citizens claiming that they have been receiving calls from people with an Indian accent. The numbers from which they have been receiving these calls seem to be originating from two-three countries and we intend to work with out Canadian counterparts to probe this matter further," the officer said.

According to CBI officials, as seen in the past, syndicates operating a credit card scam system, are generally not based out of any one particular country. Similarly the numbers from which these fraud calls are made can be concealed using commonly available technology or through sim cards acquired illegally by syndicate members.

Mumbai case

Thane based call centres, which had more than 2,000 employees, have come under police investigation for allegedly duping Americans by pretending to be Internal Revenue Service officials and threatening them with tax investigations if they did not pay up. The police has also issued a Look Out Circular (LOC) to nab Sagar Dharmesh Thakkar, the alleged mastermind of the scam which is believed to have procured almost rupees 500 crore from American citizens

Randomized Study to Evaluate the Impact of Telemedicine Care in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes With Multiple Doses of Insulin and Suboptimal HbA1c in Andalusia (Spain): PLATEDIAN Study.
To assess the impact of a telemedicine visit using the platform Diabetic compared with a face-to-face visit, on clinical outcomes, patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and physicians' satisfaction in patients with type 1 diabetes. PLATEDIAN (Telemedicine on Metabolic Control in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Andalusian Patients) (NCT03332472) was a multicenter, randomized, 6-month follow-up, open-label, parallel-group controlled study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes with suboptimal metabolic control (HbA1c <8% [<64 mmol/mol]), treated with multiple daily injections. A total of 388 patients were assessed for eligibility; 379 of them were randomized 1:1 to three face-to-face visits (control cohort [CC]) (n = 167) or the replacement of an intermediate face-to-face visit by a telemedicine visit using Diabetic (intervention cohort [IC]) (n = 163). The primary efficacy end point was the mean change of HbA1c levels from baseline to month 6. Other efficacy and safety end points were mean blood glucose, glucose variability, episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, patient-reported outcomes, and physicians' satisfaction. At month 6, the mean change in HbA1c levels was -0.04 ± 0.5% (-0.5 ± 5.8 mmol/mol) in the CC and 0.01 ± 0.6% (0.1 ± 6.0 mmol/mol) in the IC (P = 0.4941). The number of patients who achieved HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) was 73 and 78 in the CC and IC, respectively. Significant differences were not found regarding safety end points at 6 months. Changes in HRQoL between the first visit and final visit did not differ between cohorts, and, regarding fear of hypoglycemia (FH-15 ≥28), statistically significant differences observed at baseline remained unchanged at 6 months (P < 0.05). The use of telemedicine in patients with type 1 diabetes with HbA1c <8% (<64 mmol/mol) provides similar efficacy and safety outcomes as face-to-face visits.

NBC Universal is looking at “The View”-style talk shows with multiple hosts to possibly replace “The Meredith Vieira Show” as its ratings slump behind syndicated competitors, sources told Page Six. stars Tamar demographic — younger, more multicultural — to Meredith’s later-afternoon time slot.”. NBC has already tinkered with Vieira’s format in an effort to boost ratings.. The normally pretaped show was done live the week of Jan. 19, and has recently been featuring multiple guests to talk about topics like parenting and health.. Vieira recently had author Steve Santagati, former New York Giant Michael Clayton and TV host Steve Wilkos for a panel on “what your man really thinks.”. But other NBC insiders insist the network isn’t looking to replace Vieira just yet.. “With any show, you tinker with different things to see what works,” one source said, adding that the panel could become part of the program. A rep for Vieira’s show had no comment.

Springfield Partner Carole Lynch and Associate Denise M. Tremblay recently obtained summary judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiff, a former director of our client—the board of trustees of a municipal library—alleged that the Board violated his 1st Amendment rights (under 42 U.S.C. § 1983) by retaliating against him in pursuing termination of his employment and breached his contract of employment. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his claim for violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, M.G.L. c. 12, after receiving the motion for summary judgment. The judge ruled in favor of our client on the 1st Amendment claim on the grounds that the Board did not act under color of state law as its members were not “state actors.” In the alternative, the Court held that the Board was entitled to qualified immunity. The Court also entered judgment on the breach of contract claim.

Why mobile search was inevitable from 1997

Way back in May 1997, AOL finalized some amazing new technology based around its so called “OSCAR” protocolﾠwhich eventually became AOL’s flagship instant messaging system.

ﾠ

Why was this so amazing?

ﾠ

Well, it may seem something which we all take for granted in the new millenium, but at the time it was revolutionary for users to be able to communicate in real time. Furthermore, this was rolled out on a commercial scale and it proved to be a real game changer, not just for internet usage but also for broader human communication.

ﾠ

Early dominance

ﾠ

AOL’s Instant Messaging system became known simply as “AIM” and it completely dominated the market in the early 2000s. This tells us a number of things:

ﾠ

1. The developed world was eager to be able to communicate in real time, both for social and commercial reasons.

2. Business was desirous of shorter “feedback loops”, as a means of staff development and of shortening their sales cycles.

3. Collaboration in fields such as mathematics, science, education and politics became much easier, albeit creating at the same time some inherent risks.ﾠ

ﾠ

Demise

ﾠ

By 2009, however, use of AIM had largely become non-existent. This was due to a number of reasons:

ﾠ

1. Ageing technology: as processing speeds and the complexity of computing accelerated, so did demands on what was expected of AIM and its competition. New operating systems were tried, noteably the AOL XMPP Gateway. This allowsﾠthird party messaging networks to exchange messages and presence information with the AIM service. Use of the gateway is currently limited to select partners, and AOL state that parties interested in using the XMPP gateway should contact them.ﾠUse of AOL’s XMPP Gateway was and is governed by proprietary terms of service.ﾠCommercially, this was perceived as restrictive and gradually other solutions became more popular.

2. Portability: the advent of mobile phones with 3G rendered the need to be at an office or desktop unneccessary when wanting to instant message, whether by SMS or other means.ﾠ

3. Apple: Apple products surged in popularity, wiping many competitors off the map including this technology.

ﾠ

What next?

ﾠ

Looking back, it was clear that there was a desire for real time mobile communication technologies. It was inevitable, even in 1997, that technology would deliver solutions to this and the fascinating question now is how this trend will continue. It is not clear, however, that we have seen the last of AIM. Take a look at the following video for more details.

Channel 4 has appointed Alex Mahon, the former boss of the maker of MasterChef and Broadchurch, who now runs the special effects firm behind Hollywood blockbusters including Gravity and Guardians of the Galaxy, as its new chief executive.

Mahon becomes the first woman to run a UK broadcaster larger than Channel 5. She is the first female Channel 4 chief executive in the broadcaster’s 35-year history.

“Alex is an outstanding leader and a highly experienced chief executive who has developed and grown major international businesses in both the creative and technology sectors,” said the Channel 4 chairman, Charles Gurassa.

Jay Hunt quits Channel 4 post just days before decision on top job

“She brings an impressive combination of relevant experience and is brilliantly placed to help steer Channel 4 through the competitive challenges and opportunities ahead.”

Mahon will take over from David Abraham, who leaves later this year, and will immediately face the prospect of negotiations with the government over the relocation of Channel 4 out of London.

Scottish-born Mahon has previously worked closely with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, having served as a member of the advisory panel put together to help map out the future scope and remit of the BBC ahead of the renewal of its royal charter last year.

“She is a great enthusiast for Channel 4 and its unique public service remit and her recent work with government will be valuable in facilitating constructive dialogue with the new administration,” said Gurassa.

Mahon is expected to start the £900,000 a year job in October or November and will be involved with the appointment of Hunt’s successor.

Hunt is due to leave at the end of September, after handling the launch of Great British Bake Off which the broadcaster poached from the BBC last year.

“Channel 4’s unique remit to innovate and to appeal to young and diverse audiences make it an essential part of British culture,” said Mahon. “There is nowhere in the world like Channel 4 and, in these changing times, its mission is more important than ever. I’m incredibly proud to be joining Channel 4 and bring to it experience both of leading creative organisations at scale and dealing with an environment of constant technological change.”

Mahon joins from Foundry, a design and visual effects software firm with film credits including Guardians of the Galaxy and technology licensing deals with Hollywood heavyweights such as Disney, Weta Digital and Sony Pictures Imageworks, which she has run since 2015.

Calixarene Assisted Rapid Synthesis of Silver-Graphene Nanocomposites with Enhanced Antibacterial Activity.
Demonstrated herein is a single rapid approach employed for synthesis of Ag-graphene nanocomposites, with excellent antibacterial properties and low cytotoxicity, by utilizing a continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) process in combination with p-hexasulfonic acid calix[6]arene (SCX6) as an effective particle stabilizer. The nanocomposites showed high activity against E. coli (Gram-negative) and S. aureus (Gram-positive) bacteria. The materials were characterized using a range of techniques including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectrophotometry, FT-IR, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). This rapid, single step synthetic approach not only provides a facile means of enabling and controlling graphene reduction (under alkaline conditions) but also offers an optimal route for homogeneously producing and depositing highly crystalline Ag nanostructures into reduced graphene oxide substrate.

North American Single-footing Horse

The North American Single-footing Horse, also called the Single-footing Horse or Single-footer, is a horse breed originating in the southern United States. The term "single-foot" refers to an intermediate ambling gait, sometimes alternately called the rack or paso largo, where the horse lifts each foot up separately and puts it down alone.

Characteristics
The Single-footing Horse comes in a wide range of colors, including palomino and buckskin, as well as chestnut, gray, and bay.
The Single-footing Horse is a medium-sized breed of light riding horse. It is primarily known for its intermediate four-beat gait, which may range from 7 to 9 miles per hour on a trail ride to over 15 miles per hour at a road speed. High speeds in excess of 20 mph have been recorded.

Uses
The breed is almost always used for trail or pleasure riding. All Single-footers must be shod in plain keg shoes (a standard machine-made shoe) in order to maintain registration.

History
The Single-footing Horse is descended from crosses of American Saddlebreds, Standardbreds, and other gaited breeds, with some influence from Spanish bloodlines. An influential stallion was EZD Falcon Rowdy, who also influenced the Racking Horse breed.

breaks. . Swing the End of the World. Deep in the wilds of Ecuador is a seismic monitoring station known as Casa del Arbol (in the original Casa del Arbol). Its purpose is to observe the activity of the Tungurahua volcano, which is located nearby. This volcano woke up on August 19, 1999. Since then, climbing it has been banned, and it is under scrutiny. The station is a small tree house. Which can already be considered a landmark, since it is located on the edge of a fairly deep cliff. But much more interesting are the swings that hang from the branches of a tree, right next to the station (more like a large birdhouse). All over the world, these swings are known as “swings at the end of the world” or “end of the world” swings.

we used the metro but you have to change once. the pavements are not smooth if you have luggage on wheels and it is a good 5 minute walk with a bit of a hill, so takes a bit of effort.. There is a fantastic minibus service at the airport called Minibud. It took us directly to the hotel and collected us for the return. Literally door to door. The price was extremely reasonable and so convenient. Cannot recommend it enough.. we took a shuttle bus which was direct but we had a bit of a wait.. We booked the transfer with jet2.

We always have a great time when Branson joins us for our weekly Legend's dinner with Grammy & Pa. He's so full of personality and gets a long with both girls so well. :). We survived another first day of school! It was a pretty smooth morning, even Drew cooperated by sleeping most of the night and waking up to have breakfast with the girls! School is starting 10 minutes earlier than last year so we were up and at it at 6:30 to make sure we had enough time to park and walk the girls in...plus take pictures. Lots and lots of pictures!. Ava was pretty excited to go see her friends but I think as the time for leaving for school neared she got more and more nervous. She went from bubbly and talkative to a little more solemn. She did at least smile for a picture or two! :)

I have two boys who race BMX.. we travel all over for their me races and it’s become a lifestyle for our family. There is a lot of down time and the weapon of choice has been the mini bikes for several years. The first mini bike I purchased was a very well known brand and it seemed to perform well. However - I stared noticing other brands making minis that seemed equal in quality but about half the price. So when it came time to replace the bike I went with the cheaper less known brand of mini. I didn’t notice and difference in quality between the two brands. About month ago I saw a kid kit one of the races cruising the pits on a mini that looked nothing like I’d seen before. I figured some rich Factory dad had somehow found the parts to build a custom mini.. just be taking a quick glance it was obvious this mini was top of the line . Later I was able to find out it was not a custom build.. it was a Wildcat MIni that he purchased complete . The bike was similiar in price ronthe more welll known brand of mini sold in the U.S. I decided to purchase the bike and if has exceeded all’s expectations. Its smoother, faster and I would argue nicer looking then any other mini out there. My sons both love riding these bikes over anything else the have - including their race bikes which which both cost over 2k to build. You can find mini’s cheaper then Wildacat- but if they are gonna be riding a lot and you want a top notch bike this is the best there is and I’ve seen several. Until a new company emerges that can do better - wildcat is without the best bang for your buck and I will certainly be buying another Willscat once it’s time to replace the two we have now -

WOW Nathan - thank you so much for such a comprehensive review on the Wildcat Original 1B.
We really appreciate it. We strive to be the market leader in the development of Mini BMX bikes - we want our pride to be riding the best, the lightest and the strongest.

Tiny and tough! Super fun! I wish they existed when I was a kid! My little groms and I love it! Here’s a couple pics of myself playing with our new Mini freak. I’m 175 and this thing is as tough as my 20” bike and is a rush to ride! Well done to the wildcat crew for sending this gap in the in the market for young riders and adults alike. Tiny shred!!!

That’s the absolute best Edward. We love seeing dads get in on the action. Thanks for your positive review and so pleased that you and your little groms are diggin it.

[Development of direct phlebography for surgical intervention of the varix cruris].
To determine the appropriate treatment for patients with varix cruris, we performed three different methods of phlebography including direct phlebography, and compared their findings by each phlebography. Conventional ascending phlebography was taken routinely and initially in all limbs (n = 120). "Direct phlebography" developed by us was then indicated, when the visualization of the deep vein system was unclear by conventional ascending phlebography. This method was useful for the clear opacification of the deep vein system, and also was able to visualize the deep femoral vein clearly. After the precise diagnosis of varix cruris, descending phlebography under the Valsalva maneuver at supine position was carried out for the evaluation of the deep vein insufficiency. According to these phlebographic findings, conventional stripping with or without sub- or suprafascial ligation of communicating vein was indicated to saphenous typed varix cruris. The valvuloplasty to the highest valve in superficial femoral vein was carefully added in eight limbs which showed the significant reflux by added in eight limbs which showed the significant reflux by the descending phlebography. This valvuloplasty was remarkably contributed to the immediate healing of the stasis ulcer without recurrence. And compression sclerotherapy was selected to some patients with branch typed varix cruris.

BRUSSELS -- European Union ambassadors appear set to prolong asset freezes and visa bans against 146 individuals and 37 entities that, according to the EU, are responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity.

EU sources have told RFE/RL that the decision to prolong the measures by six months will be taken ahead of a September 15 deadline without much discussion.

The targets of the sanctions include companies in Crimea and various battalions formed by the Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, as well as Russian politicians like Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and Dmitry Kiselyov, a state media executive and presenter whom many regard as the Kremlin's chief propagandist.

The sanctions were first introduced in March 2014 after Russia's seizure and illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.

The EU's economic sanctions that target Russia's energy, military, and financial sectors are up for renewal on January 31.

EU sources told RFE/RL that those sectoral sanctions will be discussed at a Brussels summit of EU leaders in October.

Removal of the distal 75% of the pancreas may be done in adults without producing diabetes or deficiency of external pancreatic secretion. This procedure is often employed in the treatment of malignant and benign tumors. Resection of the body and tail of the pancreas may also be useful in treatment of an occasional patient who sustains severe trauma to the pancreas with complete transection, or with a crushing injury involving the distal portion of this organ. Little data are available, however, concerning the effect of extensive pancreatic resection upon the young, growing individual. Although such a procedure does not result in the development of diabetes, the quantitative requirements for exocrine secretion during the phase of rapid growth have not been established. This experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of distal subtotal pancreatectomy on the growth and metabolism of young mice.. Material and Methods. Ninety C-3-H mice, each 4.

The study of graphs, or graph theory, is used in communications and information technology systems for various purposes. A graph refers to a collection of nodes (or vertices) and a collection of edges that connect pairs of nodes. A dominating set DS for a graph G is a set of nodes in G such that every node not in DS is joined to at least one member of DS by some edge. That is, each node in G is either a member of the dominating set DS or 1 hop away from a member node (may also be referred to as a dominating node). It is noted that a dominating set may include disjoint sets of nodes in the graph.
A connected dominating set (CDS) of a graph G includes a dominating set and a set of connecting nodes that may be needed to connect disjoint nodes in the dominating set. CDSs have traditionally been used in mobile ad-hoc networks for routing applications. For instance, broadcast and multicast protocols may efficiently reach all destinations by restricting transmissions to nodes that are members of the CDS (instead of every node in the graph). In addition to routing, mobile ad-hoc networks may benefit from CDSs in other areas including channel access, link adaptation, energy consumption, power control, dynamic resource management and the like.
Since a given graph may have more than one CDS, it may be beneficial to identify a CDS with minimum number of elements (e.g., nodes and/or edges). Such a CDS may be referred to as a minimum connected dominating set (MCDS). However, it has been shown that the computation complexity of minimum connected dominating set problem (MCDS), and minimum dominating set problem (MDS) in general, is NP-complete. Therein lies a need for a system and method capable of efficiently identifying a CDS with the number of elements as close to the minimum number as possible.

Characterization and technological properties of Staphylococcus xylosus strains isolated from a Tunisian traditional salted meat.
The technological properties of strains of Staphylococcus xylosus were studied to select the most suitable for use as starter cultures for the production of dried fermented meat products. Strains of S. xylosus were isolated from traditional salted Tunisian meat and were identified by biochemical and molecular methods. Thirty strains of S. xylosus were studied to evaluate their catalase, nitrate reductase, lipolytic, proteolytic and antibacterial activities as well as growth ability at different temperatures, pH's and NaCl concentrations. All strains of S. xylosus had catalase activity and were able to reduce nitrates to nitrites. The nitrate reductase activity increased when the strains were kept under anaerobic conditions. Proteolytic activity on milk and on gelatin agar was demonstrated for 100% and 83.3% of the S. xylosus isolates, respectively. However extracellular proteolytic activity as assessed by the azocasein method was poor in all the strains. Lipolytic activity as assessed by the agar method showed that 76.6% of strains of S. xylosus could hydrolyze Tween 20 against 33.3% that could hydrolyze tributyrin. Tween 80 was hydrolyzed by only 10% of strains. Strains of S. xylosus hydrolyzed pork fat better than beef and lamb fat. The majority of strains had antibacterial activity against Salmonella arizonae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis.

Mobility means synching up

If you’re an IT executive today, things pretty much work this way: so very often when you get a present from a family member, it’s the latest in mobile computing devices. In fact, most executives in this business are already carrying wireless handheld devices alongside a two-way pager and a cell phone.

Of course, I personally can’t wait to have my own version of a Dick Tracy watch, which means that just about anybody will be able to contact me whenever they take a notion to do so. But the fundamental problem with mobile computing is the need for such a concept – apart from existing IT services, that is.

To make matters worse, companies such as Verizon now are giving away free Internet-enabled phones to people willing to sign long-term contracts. L.M. Ericcson Telephone Co., meanwhile, is working with AT&T Corp. to create a new generation of wireless consumers by giving away wireless devices shaped like phones, allowing people to win prizes by interacting with the Who Wants to be a Millionaire television program.

The reason this represents such an immense problem for IT is that all these executives are sure they can’t live without such devices. Naturally, this means they want the devices connected to their work environments so that they can become ever more productive.

What most people don’t realize is that this presents a huge challenge for IT. Each mobile device on the market today comes with its own set of built-in services for e-mail and calendering. In order to integrate those services with existing corporate services built around Lotus Development Corp.’s Notes or Microsoft Corp.’s Exchange, IT organizations have to invest in synchronization software that can be purchased from more than a dozen different vendors today.

The problem is that every time one of the devices this software is intended to synchronize gets updated, the synchronization software needs to be updated. And of course anytime any of the core enterprise applications gets an upgrade, you’ll also need to update the synchronization software.

For IT people, this creates an infinite synchronization loop that diverts attention away from their real jobs: to make sure that their company has a working IT infrastructure. This loop exists because the concept of mobile computing has not yet sufficiently worked its way into our application development and Internet infrastructure psyche. Instead of having to purchase synchronization software to make the concept of mobile computing a reality, the technology needed to support mobile computing should be built directly into the applications we use and the services provided by ISPs.

Unfortunately, we’re a good two years away from seeing this approach become a reality, so in the meantime we can expect to see continued proliferation of mobile computing products that just add to the problem.

Alas, trying to put a lid on this phenomenon is roughly akin to the effort back in the 1980s of trying to stop the infiltration of PCs into corporate environments. The reality is that you can’t stop people when it comes to acquiring the latest gadget in an economy where people have far too much disposable income. And if you don’t try to support it, end-users will once again view the IT department as a behind-the-times bottleneck that prevents them from attaining data nirvana alongside their latest stock quotes.

So the best thing you can do for the moment is make a short-term investment in synchronization software because you will have some modicum of control. Nevertheless, IT organizations should also be putting a tremendous amount of pressure on ISVs and ISPs to create truly seamless mobile computing infrastructures.

After all, it’s in their interest to do so. Once we have such platforms, everybody can participate. Until then, mobile computing will just remain a troublesome niche application for those who can afford to pay for it.

The only question that remains is, how long are we going to have to live with mobile solutions that only take us part of the way there?

yorkshire pudding.. breakfast and dinner version..

i am a huge huge cheer's fan.. it's one of my all time favorite shows.. and one my favorite characters was cliff clavin, the under appreciated, hapless loser mail carrier.. one episode cliff explains yorkshire pudding to the cheer's gang here. and i have always remembered his "explanation" now i have since learned it was bogus but that was part of cliff's charm he made crap up and lead you to believe it was fact.. kind of like when i tell shell or jake "well you know i read on the internet... blah blah" and shell calls me out every time.. she says "MOM YOU CAN NOT QUOTE PEREZ HILTON as a legitimate source of facts.. {head hanging in shame} i can't help it.. he wouldn't put anything on his web site that wasn't true right?? right?? helloooooo **tapping on computer screen** right?? well enough with my gullibility.. when i was a kid, well 9th grade, i stayed my friend kathy's house all the time and we made this for breakfast every time!! we would sit with our warm "oven pancake" and smear jam on it and watch american bandstand.. {ok i don't know if we watched american bandstand we probably watched smurfs but hey i have an image to uphold here..} any way when my mom and i would go to lawry's prime rib house {i've mentioned before my fondness for that place} they always served with their prime rib a yorkshire pudding.. theirs were individual so they were more like a pop over, now i could have, i repeat, could have made individual ones, you see my mother in law gave me a pop over pan once.. {very nice of her huh} and well it was big and bulky and so i moved out to my cabinet in the garage.. if you've been reading this blog for any amount of time you have heard me tell my tales of woe about putting things in the garage.. pete donates them!! right out of my cabinet.. {he doesn't anymore because i threatened to clean out the garage one day and donate his crap..} so you guessed it.. he donated my pop over pan.. *sigh* so i had to make one big one.. nevertheless it was yummy and decadent and delicious.

preheat your oven to 425 degrees {f}... ladle your pan drippings from your roast into a large iron skillet {or put your butter in a large iron skillet} now add your "drippings/butter" to the oven to get hot ..just a few minutes.. meanwhile make your batter.. sift your flour and salt together.. add your eggs and milk and whisk until thoroughly combined.. add your pepper {don't add pepper if making for breakfast} and quickly incorporate.. remove drippings/butter from oven and pour batter right until the hot drippings/butter.. put in oven and cook for 12-15 minutes until puffy and lightly brown.. remove from oven and serve hot.. when serving for dinner i like to put my meat right on top of it.. when serving for breakfast i like to serve it with raspberry jam.. yummy!!!

kaotic kitchen

my little space on the net for recipes and thoughts... i should start off by saying I am not a blogger, this is, shall we say, a journal of sorts for my recipes and random thoughts now and again, to be shared with family and friends. my cooking philosophy is simple, if the recipe has too many ingredients I won't cook it, too many pots and pans required I won't do it, sandwiches DO NOT constitute dinner. I cook simple, quick and easy meals.

about me

I have had a love for cooking since I was young.. well ok at first it wasn't a love it was my "chore." but love came later.. When I turned 16 my Mother started me reading recipes on Sunday and then picking 2 or 3 from her cook books or magazines and then preparing a grocery list from the recipe (which today I am lost if I don't have my detailed list for my trip to the store) from my list I would then clip coupons and I would head off to the grocery store.. As an incintive (I always need incintives and money works wonders *smile*) I was allowed to keep any money I saved from the coupons and she would then pay me per meal I made. I had to cook at leaast 2 a week but if wanted more money I would cook more, the prices ranged from $5.00 for simple meals such as tacos and refried beans (no canned in my house) or $15.00 for something like Chicken Cacciatore (because it takes so much longer but is so much worth it). So when I got married and got a house of my own I was able to conquer the grocery store and cooking delicious meals. um thanks Mom?

What’s The Forecast On Kepler-7B? Hot And Cloudy

by

October 01, 201311:02 AM

Scientists are reasonably sure that it’s a cloudy day on , a planet that orbits its star about 1,000 light-years away from us.

Using NASA’s orbiting space telescopes, researchers publishing in say that for the first time they’ve been able to make a rudimentary map of the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet.

The team used faint visible light and infrared reflections from Kepler-7b to make their cloud map.

“By observing this planet with Spitzer and Kepler [telescopes] for more than three years, we were able to produce a very low-resolution ‘map’ of this giant, gaseous planet,” study co-author Brice-Olivier Demory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge said in a statement.

Governments love to blame international forces beyond their control for economic ills at home. Gordon Brown was a dab hand at this. But when a boom which involved a tripling of debt and house prices ends in a bust should we really be surprised? And could the governments of Spain and the UK not have stepped in to end the excesses long before their economies got addicted to debt? I think so and let us hope they don't let booms get carried away again although looking at both countries the next boom seems an awfully long way off.

The Indians have placed righty Corey Kluber on the 10-day DL with lower back discomfort, per a team announcement. He’ll be replaced for the time being by righty Joe Colon.

Kluber has reportedly been dealing with the back issue throughout the early portion of the season, so it seems the hope is that some rest will help him move past it. He has struggled somewhat thus far, perhaps due in part to the nagging discomfort.

Though Kluber is still carrying a strong 9.9 K/9 on the year, he has allowed more walks (3.1 BB/9) than usual and has coughed up seven long balls through 37 1/3 innings. His velocity has dropped a bit, with his four-seamer sitting at 91.5 mph and his sinker averaging 92.1 mph.

Literacy Notes
The 2013 Literacy Directors’ Retreat
Literacy directors from throughout
the state met to exchange ideas at
Oklahoma’s annual literacy directors’
retreat. For the second year in a row,
the retreat theme was inspired by an
old I Love Lucy television episode
featuring Lucy and Ethel working
in a chocolate factory. A morning
brainstorming session had directors
comparing new tutors to Lucy and
Ethel’s chocolate wrapping experi-ence.
What was the consensus? Unlike
Lucy and Ethel’s humorous work
practices, volunteer tutors are suc-cessful
when they receive adequate
training, on-going supervision, and
regular feedback. Interspersed be-tween
fun activities, program direc-tors
also discussed fund raising, adult
learner book clubs, health literacy,
and techniques to deal with stress.
The retreat was made possible thanks
to Library Services and Technology
Act funds from the Institute of Mu-seum
and Library Services.
[Left to right] Ida Fay Winters describes the health literacy project in Altus. • Rebecca Barker shares ideas on using high interest
reading materials. • Jana Smithey (Elk City) and other literacy directors try to balance a hula hoop during team building exercise.

Q:

What is the actual role of ZooKeeper in Kafka 2.1?

I have seen some similar questions as follows:
www.quora.com/What-is-the-actual-role-of-Zookeeper-in-Kafka-What-benefits-will-I-miss-out-on-if-I-don%E2%80%99t-use-Zookeeper-and-Kafka-together
Is Zookeeper a must for Kafka?
But I want to know the latest information about this question.
What is the actual role of ZooKeeper in Kafka 2.1?

A:

Zookeeper is required to run a Kafka Cluster.
It is used by Kafka brokers to perform elections (controller and topic leaders), to store topic metadata and various other things (ACLs, dynamic broker configs, quotas, Producer Ids)
Since Kafka 0.9, clients don't require access to Zookeeper, only brokers rely on it.

We need to keep America the world's greatest magnet for immigrants. Why? Today, more and more people around the globe have access to the same technological tools for innovation and entrepreneurship. In such a world, the countries that make it easy to draw in human talent will have a distinct advantage. Also, a steady flow of immigrants keeps a society flexible and competitive. The more open your society is to new people and ideas, the more things will be done by you, not to you. We shouldn't just welcome educated immigrants, but laborers as well. Immigrants keep energy flowing in America's veins. But because I strongly favor immigration, I also favor a high fenceif not a physical one, then at least a tamper-proof national I.D. card for every American, without which you could not get a legal job or access to government services. We will not sustain a majority in favor of flexible immigration if we can't control our borders. Good fences make good immigration policy.. Thomas L. Friedman [4/5/06]

Tin Top Bridge. Tin-Top Bridge. Hyde Hall, East Springfield, New York. This bridge was completed in 2011 and provides access to Hyde Hall from Tin Top through its Mill Road entrance. The existing culvert, which replaced the original bridge in the early 20th century, washed out in June 2006.

Pfizer announced that the final analysis results show its COVI-19 vaccine is 95% effective in preventing infections, even to elderly, and caused no serious side effects, the company said Wednesday.. The company is preparing to formally ask U.S. Food and Drug Administration to allow emergency use of the vaccine. The announcement came after as coronavirus cases in the US skyrocketed and other parts of the world, giving hopes for an end to the pandemic.. .. Earlier this week, competitor Moderna Inc. also announced 94.5% effectiveness of its own COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which is made with the same, brand-new technology — using a snippet of the genetic code of the coronavirus to train the body to recognize if the real virus comes along.

Sir,. Condoleeza Rice's statement on claims that the US has transported prisoners to be tortured in foreign states and in secret prison camps is the height of sophistry.. It sickens me that the US administration, which claims to lead the world in human rights, is quibbling over legalisms with far greater consequence than President Clinton's manoeuvres over oral sex with Monica Lewinsky.. Ms Rice claims that near-drowning of terrorist suspects, or the causing of pain near but not equivalent to organ failure, is not torture.. If our Prime Minister is to prevent any further damage to the UK's global reputation and safety against future terrorist attacks, he must utterly repudiate such claims.. Dr Ian Brown. London WC1

Monika Kořínková and Barbora Šimková debuted their first collaboration together with the 'Pierot Porcelain Tableware Collection.' The home accessory range evokes a sense of minimalism and tradition and consists of cups, saucers, bowls and vases.. In creating the set, the duo wanted to "bring back a certain culture of dining." The elegant tableware is meant to help people take a break from their busy lives through dining experiences. Also, a tradition of tableware aesthetics has also been diminishing, with less people investing in finer porcelain dishes.. The Pierot collection features a soft color palette with light gold accents. Some of the pieces were achieved through the act of recycling old shapes of tableware -- inspired by porcelain decor and vintage cut glass.. Eccentric Porcelain Dishware. Score.

Don?. Hi, I think it is very refreshing that you have decided to keep some of your precious life private. I myself am in the process of writing lifestyle blogs and launching a new babywear product and as a naturally private person was also contemplating how much of my life I would need to disclose in order to be a successful blogger. I know that part of blogging means opening up and sharing parts of your life with the world so that they can relate with you, however I also believe there needs to be a balance between being able to capture and experience personal moments that only you and your family share with moments that will inspire or positively influence someone else out there in the wide world! Good luck with your new parenting life and business ventures. 😊

"Let’s be honest here – we love to snack as much as anyone. Why else would we start our own snack company? One bite will have you saying MMM-MMM. And when you discover they are also heart-healthy, you might say HMMMMM? Good for you AND tasty? How did they do that?

For starters, all of our chips are made with plant sterols and have been proven to lower cholesterol. We use only heart-healthy oils, plus other great ingredients like whole oats and whole grains (our tortilla chips) and a frying process that helps our potato chips have 40% less fat than regular potato chips.

Now doing something good for your heart is as easy as opening a bag of Corazonas heart-healthy chips!"

Equestrian lessons. Dressage is the execution, by a trained horse, of precision movements in response to barely perceptible signals from its rider. Dressage harmoniously develops the physique and ability of both the horse and rider.. Cleland’s equestrian lessons are for riders from beginner to advanced level who are aspiring to ride competitively and become world-class dressage or show-jumping equestrians. These lessons are intensive and are aimed towards riders who have already undertaken or would like to begin equestrianism as an athletic sport.. Our equestrian lessons are coached by FEI Level 2 Coach and FEI World Dressage Final Silver and Bronze Medalist Akoele Roachford. Akoele was trained in both dressage and showjumping in Germany. She has trained many students to a level where they were able to acquire full and partial equestrian scholarships to universities in the USA.. All Equestrian lessons are private lessons, lasting between 45 minutes to 1 hour, and will be scheduled to your convenience.

Democracy and Economic Growth. Date2012-05-23. Author. Uslu, Hakan. Type of Degreethesis. DepartmentEconomics. MetadataShow full item record. Abstract. A common theorem of political economists is that democracy and income are strongly correlated. There are conflicting views on the direction of the causality. Coups that started due to non- economic reasons are shocks to democracy. I use such coups to test the hypothesis that democracy causes high economic development. My results suggest that anti-democratic coups have a significant negative effect on economic development. On the other hand, democracy has a strong positive effect on economic development. This study focuses on how an anti-democratic change in regime influences the income level in a country.. Files. - Name:. - thesis_final_21May2012.pdf. - Size:. - 480.4Kb

About Scott Walker. Scott Walker is the 45th and current Governor of Wisconsin. He also served in the Wisconsin State Assembly and as the Milwaukee County Executive. He was recently elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association. First elected governor in the 2010 Wisconsin general election and was reelected governor in the 2014 Wisconsin gubernatorial election. The response to Walker’s policies included protests at the Wisconsin State Capitol and an effort to recall Walker. Walker introduced a budget plan which limited the collective bargaining of most Wisconsin public employees. Walker survived the 2012 recall election, becoming the first American governor to survive a recall effort. Walker was a candidate for his party’s nomination to the 2016 presidential election but left early in the contest..

If it matters, as a customer /user, I'd rather forego all my data on their

than have Garmin pay the ransom.

According to this TC article, it's basically illegal for a company to pay the
ransom:

The village is served by Poppleton railway station on the Harrogate Line. According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 1,961, increasing to 1,997 at the 2011 Census.  Before 1996, it was part of the Borough of Harrogate.

The name is derived from popel (pebble) and tun (hamlet, farm) and means "Pebble Farm" because of the gravel bed upon which the village was built. Upper Poppleton has been referred to as "Land Poppleton" and the neighbouring village of Nether Poppleton as "Water Poppleton" indicating their position relative to the river.

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles. It became a Conservation Area in 1993.

History
In 972, the village was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles as "Popeltun" and in the Domesday Book as "Popeltune". The villages and lands were given by Osbert De Arches to the Abbot of St Mary's in York. It was, therefore, under the ecclesiastical rule of the Parish of St Mary-Bishophill Junior.

During the reign of Richard II the village was the scene of the murder of a Mayor of York.

In 1644 the 25,000 strong Scottish and Parliament Armies, led by the Earl of Manchester, laid siege to the city of York. To facilitate communications, they built a "Bridge of Boats" at Poppleton. This bridge was eventually taken by Prince Rupert and his Royalist Forces, but he subsequently lost the battle at Marston Moor.

The village benefitted from the growth in the railways in the 19th century, when the York, Knaresborough and Harrogate Railway routed their line through Poppleton and erected a station.

Governance
Upper Poppleton lies within the Rural West Ward of the City of York Unitary Authority. As of the 2011 elections it is represented by Councillors Ian Gillies, Paul Healey and Chris Steward who are all members of the local Conservative Party. It is also a part of the UK Parliamentary Constituency of York Outer as well as the EU region of Yorkshire and the Humber.

Locally there is a Parish Council with eight council members.

Economy
The Poppletons were formerly agricultural settlements with many farms, but the modern village is mostly a dormitory for commuters to the nearby towns and cities. It has benefited from its good road and rail links. The village has local retail facilities, including a Post Office, and some small enterprises.

Demography
In the 19th century the population has varied between 284 and 346. The census of 2001 recorded the population as 1,961.

Community
There are two allotment sites in the village of Upper Poppleton. One is located at the end of Beech Grove and the other is in Main Street next to the Library. There are eight allotments on the Beech Grove Allotments, each approximately 300 square metres. The land is owned by the Parish Council. Main Street Allotments have seven plots.

There is a Youth Club and Scout Troop in the village.

Education
In 1797, local ironmonger John Dodsworth founded a Church of England School. This was converted into accommodation for the School Master when a new building was built in 1850. As of 2010 Poppleton Ousebank Primary provides primary education for both Poppletons.

For secondary education, the village is in the catchment area of York High School on Cornlands Road in nearby Acomb, though the nearest secondary school is Manor CE on Millfield Lane. Manor is a Church of England School and has its own admissions policy separate from the local City Council. It was originally built in 1813 at Kings Manor and has moved several times before being sited in Millfield Lane.

Transport

Harrogate Coach Travel buses run past the village as part of the York to Ripon route.

First York buses operate in the village as part of the Nether Poppleton route to York/Stamford Bridge. Transdev York buses operate in the village, as part of the Nether Poppleton route to York/Stamford Bridge, As well as through the village, as part of the Askham Bar/Acomb to Clifton Moor/Monks Cross/University route. Eddie Brown buses run past the village as part of the York to Boroughbridge/Ripon route.

A Park and Ride (Poppleton Bar) was constructed by the A59 in 2015, with Park and Ride buses (route 59) running from Poppleton to York centre, generally every ten minutes.

Northern Rail operates a stopping service on the line between York and Leeds via Harrogate. Poppleton station is the first station after York.

Religion

The old Norman 'Chapel of All Hallows' in Upper Poppleton was demolished in 1890 to make way for the Victorian Church of All Saints. The 'new' church was designed by Hodgson Fowler of Durham.

In 1866, the two Poppleton Parishes were united to form the Parish of Nether Poppleton with Upper Poppleton. All Saints' Church is situated on The Green in Upper Poppleton.

The present Methodist Chapel on the Green replaced two previous buildings on the site built in 1817 and 1819 respectively.

Sports
Poppleton United 1st XI play in York Football League Premier Division, as of 2010, and play next to the Community Centre on Main Street. The 2nd XI play in Reserve Division C. Poppleton Tigers Junior Football Club is located in Nether Poppleton, but serves both villages.

There is a Lawn Tennis Club with artificial and all weather courts in Main Street. As of 2010 the Men's 1st and second team play in Division One of the Tyke Petroleum Tennis League and the 3rd team play in Division Six. The Ladies 1st team also compete in the Ladies section of the same League, with the 1st team playing in Division One, the 2nd team in Division Three and the 3rd team in Division Three as of 2010. They also enter five teams in the Mixed Section in Divisions One, Two, Six Eight and Eleven.

Orienteering in Tilgate Forest. Published on 05/02/20. Despite the squelchy and swamp-like conditions at the regional orienteering event in Tilgate Forest, the two members of the Claremont Fan Court School orienteering squad made the journey to Crawley and completed their courses in impressive fashion.. On the 2.7 km orange course, Thomas F navigated steadily, with no significant errors, and was very pleased to finish in 49:53 for 8th place. Ellis B, on his first outing this year, sped round the 2 km yellow course to finish in first place in the excellent time of 21:35. After his best result so far, Ellis is looking forward to moving up to the orange course at Ashdown Forest.

State leaders continue to rail against federal tax plan

The tax overhaul plan proposed by President Donald Trump and now being considered in Congress would end the deduction on federal income tax forms for state and local property taxes. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said it would disproportionately harm New Yorkers, where property taxes are among the highest in the nation, and he’s taken opportunities at recent public events to make the case against the plan.

WBFO Albany Correspondent Karen DeWitt reports.

Cuomo called the plan unfair “double taxation.” If New Yorkers are not allowed to deduct their state and local taxes, they essentially would be taxed twice – once by state and local governments and again by the federal government on earnings that they already paid in the form of taxes to the state and local governments. He estimated it would cost New York $17.5 billion a year.

“This is like upside-down world,” Cuomo said on Oct. 5 on Long Island. “It’s called a tax cut plan. It’s really a tax increase for most New Yorkers.”

Cuomo predicted that getting rid of the deduction also would ruin the state’s business climate, which is already struggling in some regions.

“It is an attempt by the federal government, purposeful or coincidental, to make New York and several states actually less competitive for businesses,” Cuomo said on Oct. 3 in New York City.

The governor is not alone in his opposition. Fellow Democrats, including State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, also are worried. DiNapoli said recently that he’s “very concerned” about the effects of eliminating the deduction.

“For a high-tax state like New York, state and local tax deductibility has been a very important component of the federal tax code,” said DiNapoli, who added that even with a proposed higher standard deduction, it’s still not a “win” for New York taxpayers.

DiNapoli and Cuomo have conducted separate studies showing that New Yorkers give over $40 billion more in taxes to the federal government than the state gets back, an imbalance that has doubled in recent years.

U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is New York’s senior senator and the Senate minority leader, said it’s not just New Yorkers who will be adversely affected. Schumer said one-third of total taxpayers in the United States, or about 44 million, currently take the state and local tax deductions. He recently released data showing that people in states like Georgia, a Republican stronghold, and Colorado also would be affected.

“The effect of removing state and local deductibility is deep and wide,” Schumer said. “And I think it’s going to alone kill the Republican plan as it is.”

Schumer predicted that the elimination of the deduction eventually will be dropped from the plan. He said he was involved in the last successful tax overhaul in the 1980s. He said the deduction was ultimately kept in the plan because it would have adversely affected too many lawmakers’ constituents.

Several Republican congressmen and women in New York already have said they are against getting rid of the state and local property tax deductions, including John Faso of the Hudson Valley and Peter King of Staten Island. Seven GOP members, including Claudia Tenney and John Katko, both of central New York, and Elise Stefanik of the North Country, wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, asking him to reconsider.

Cuomo said if the final plan includes the elimination of the deduction, he’ll go to court to stop it.

True molecular solutions of natural cellulose in the binary ionic liquid-containing solvent mixtures.
Evidence is presented for the first time of true molecular dissolution of cellulose in binary mixtures of common polar organic solvents with ionic liquid. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, small-angle neutron-, X-ray- and static light scattering were used to investigate the structure of cellulose solutions in mixture of dimethyl formamide and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. Structural information on the dissolved chains (average molecular weight ∼ 5 × 10(4)g/mol; gyration radius ∼ 36 nm, persistence length ∼ 4.5 nm), indicate the absence of significant aggregation of the dissolved chains and the calculated value of the second virial coefficient ∼ 2.45 × 10(-2)mol ml/g(2) indicates that this solvent system is a good solvent for cellulose. More facile dissolution of cellulose could be achieved in solvent mixtures that exhibit the highest electrical conductivity. Highly concentrated cellulose solution in pure ionic liquid (27 wt.%) prepared according to novel method, utilizing the rapid evaporation of a volatile co-solvent in binary solvent mixtures at superheated conditions, shows insignificant cellulose molecular aggregation.

Employers cannot force employees to retire at 65 without a clear justification in each case after a ruling by the UK’s Supreme Court yesterday.. Five justices ruled that Leslie Seldon, a partner in a Kent firm, had not been treated unfairly when compulsorily retired at 65. But they sent his case back to the employment tribunal to consider whether the mandatory age of 65, in the circumstances of the law firm, was a “proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aims of the partnership”.. The ruling sets out new guidance for firms and companies, making clear they can force employees to

Q:

Is there a tool for windows that creates formula-pictures out of a text-formula

I am looking for a tool that would batch process text-files containing formulas (possibly latex style) and convert them into a gif/png/jpg. Since I want to do a batch conversion, the tool ideally runs in cmd.exe.
What I need is probably possible with a latex installation (MiKTeX comes to mind), but if not absolutely necessary, I don't want to install 100MB+ for my need.
Is there such a tool?

A:

The "best" solution for quality is to use a full LaTeX installation, and then generate images via command line with e.g. mathTeX.
From my answer to a similar (but not duplicate, imho) question here at Super User:

MathTeX, licensed under the gpl, is a cgi program that lets you easily embed LaTeX math in your own html pages, blogs, wikis, etc. It parses a LaTeX math expression and immediately emits the corresponding gif (or png) image, rather than the usual TeX dvi. So just place an html  tag in your document wherever you want to see the corresponding LaTeX expression.

It can either be used as a CGI script on the server and linked directly from the <img> tag, or run on the command-line to generate standalone image files. From the homepage:

mathTeX is usually run by your web server as a cgi program, obtaining its input expression from the query-string of an html  tag. But you can also run mathTeX from your Unix shell, supplying all input on the command line. For example, ./mathtex.cgi "x^2+y^2" –o equation1   renders an image of x^2+y^2 in file equation1.gif.

There is actually a related project called mimeTeX that sounds more or less exactly like what you want, even though the quality is said to not be as good as with a full LaTeX installation solution as mathTeX uses, and it can naturally not handle all LaTeX cases without a LaTeX installation.
Like mathTeX, it is made primarily with webservers in mind, but in the same way, it can be run from the command line. You don't specify OS, which often indicates Windows, and compilation instructions for Windows are available on the project page linked earlier.

EDIT: I noted that the mimeTeX page provides pre-compiled binaries for Windows as well, under §5.1. Just download that and follow the instructions, as any regular Windows program. If you are on e.g. Debian or Ubuntu, both mimeTeX and mathTeX are part of the main repository.

What's the best way to laying out a brochure (trifold) 8.5" x 11" using InDesign?. Where is your problem? Why not start to work?. A trifold needs to have the fold-in panel slightly smaller in width than the other 2 panels. The paper thickness determines the appropriate panel size, but for general purposes, 1/16 inch smaller for the fold-in should suffix.. For referencing the pages of a trifold, use this numbering scheme: front 5-6-1 and back 2-3-4.. You can lay this out with two 11 x 8.5 pages OR 6 single pages arranged in a group of 1-2-3 and 4-5-6. Using the 6 single page method requires a version of Indesign that allows modifying page sizes. NOTE: you can set up 3 equal size panels, but this can create a folding issue.. To achieve the 1/16 inch smaller panel, create guides/pages with the following widths: [front 3.625 - 3.6875 - 3.6875] and [back 3.6875 - 3.6875 - 3.625]

.. As a result of Mkhitaryan’s aforementioned demands, Thomas Tuchel’s side would have to sell him this summer itself in order to avoid losing him for free next year. And because of that, Arsenal now have the chance of signing the player for a bargain price of just £20m!. Mkhitaryan, who is widely regarded as one of the most technically gifted players of his position, in Europe, was in scintillating form for his club last season during the course of which he scored 23 goals and provided 32 assists in 52 appearances. He may prove to be a massively useful signing for the Gunners, going by his capability to play as a winger and an attacking midfielder and the amount of big stage experience that he possesses, and may complement the likes of Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez pretty well.

Zinc(II) complexes of the second-generation quinolone antibacterial drug enrofloxacin: Structure and DNA or albumin interaction.
Zinc mononuclear complexes with the second-generation quinolone antibacterial drug enrofloxacin in the absence or presence of a nitrogen donor heterocyclic ligand 1,10-phenanthroline or 2,2'-bipyridine have been synthesized and characterized. Enrofloxacin is on deprotonated mode acting as a bidentate ligand coordinated to zinc ion through the ketone and a carboxylato oxygen atoms. The crystal structure of bis(enrofloxacinato)(1,10-phenanthroline)zinc(II), 2, has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The biological activity of the complexes has been evaluated by examining their ability to bind to calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) with UV and fluorescence spectroscopies. UV studies of the interaction of the complexes with DNA have shown that they can bind to CT DNA and the DNA binding constants have been calculated. Competitive studies with ethidium bromide (EB) have shown that the complexes exhibit the ability to displace the DNA-bound EB indicating that they bind to DNA in strong competition with EB for the intercalative binding site. The complexes exhibit good binding propensity to human and bovine serum albumin proteins having relatively high binding constant values.

Rapid response to budesonide (Pulmicort) inhaled via the Nebuhaler in asthmatic children.
Acute reversible airways obstruction in children, especially those aged under one year, who may respond poorly to inhaled beta 2-stimulants, is difficult to treat in general practice. In an open study, 48 episodes in 29 children, half aged under one year, were treated with budesonide (Pulmicort) 0.1-2.09 mg used to charge a Nebuhaler fitted with a facemask. In 45 instances, clinical improvement was observed, and with doses of 0.8 mg and above, this usually occurred within 10 minutes. This study suggests that budesonide via a suitable delivery system can evoke rapid improvement in reversible airways obstruction in young children.

Q:

How to Extract people's last name start with "S" and first name not start with "S"

As the title shows, how do I capture a person who:

Last name start with letter "S"
First name NOT start with letter "S"

The expression should match the entire last name, not just the first letter, and first name should NOT be matched.
Input string is like the following:

(Last name) (First name)
Duncan, Jean
Schmidt, Paul
Sells, Simon
Martin, Jane
Smith, Peter
Stephens, Sheila

This is my regular expression:
/([S].+)(?:, [^S])/

Here is the result I have got:

Schmidt, P
Smith, P

the result included "," space & letter "P" which should be excluded.
The ideal match would be

Schmidt
Smith

A:

You can try this pattern: ^S\w+(?=, [A-RT-Z]).
^S\w+ matches any word (name in your case) that start with S at the beginning,
(?=, [A-RT-Z]) - positive lookahead - makes sure that what follows, is not the word (first name in your case) starting with S ([A-RT-Z] includes all caps except S).

The primary field of application for this invention is guidance of unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles. In such applications it is common practice to compute a guidance command that results in a rate of turn that depends on a measurement of heading error. Both the measurement and the command are with respect to an inertial coordinate frame of reference. The guidance command is received and acted upon by a system (commonly referred to as an autopilot or stability augmentation system), which in turn sends commands to the vehicles servos and/or reaction control devices. This results in a movement of the vehicle's control surfaces, or vectors the thrust produced by the vehicle's propulsion system, or turns on-and-off a reaction control system, or a combination of such means of vehicle control. However vehicles respond to servo command relative to the medium through which they move, and when that medium is also in motion, then the rate of turn that is achieved depends nonlinearly on the speed and direction of the medium through which the vehicle is moving. This dependence can result in degraded or even unstable responses to the guidance system command, particularly for vehicles whose speed relative to the medium is not far greater than the speed of the medium itself (e.g. guided parafoils and underwater vehicles).
One approach to this problem is to sense the vector motion of the vehicle relative to the medium through which it is moving as well as its inertial velocity vector. By differencing these two quantities, one can compute the inertial velocity of the medium and provide a correction to the guidance command for that motion. However this requires incorporating devices that sense the vehicle's vector relative motion, which are not normally a part of the existing guidance and control system design. Such sensors in an aircraft are often referred to as an air data system.

Deep brain stimulation of globus pallidus internus in a 16-year-old boy with severe tourette syndrome and mental retardation.
A 16- year-old boy with long-standing severe Tourette syndrome (TS) and mental retardation, non-responsive to complex pharmocological and behavioural treatment was selected for bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Pre-operative and post-operative Yale Tourette syndrome scale (YTSS) scores and several other scores were used to quantify the effect of DBS up to one year follow-up. Although subscores of the YTSS improved, the overall outcome of chronic GPi-DBS showed no substantial therapeutic effect. This finding is in contrast to markedly improved TS of the only two adolescent TS patients in whom DBS has been performed so far. In this article we discuss possible reasons for the poor therapeutic effect of GPi-DBS in our patient contributing to the on-going debate on DBS inclusion criteria for adolescent TS patients.

For a long time, simply proving the existence of exoplanets was a big deal. We had over a hundred years of fiction and even non-fiction based on the assumption that our universe is absolutely packed with alien planets — but we simply couldn’t prove that they existed. Now, with the list of planets outside our solar system ballooning by dozens or more at a time, the stakes are quite a bit higher. Simply finding and identifying exoplanets is no longer enough to impress, and now you have to actually learn something about them. That’s been the goal of a team from MIT, which this week publishes a piece detailing their pioneering new method for looking at alien weather.

That’s much easier said than done, however, for many of the same reasons that it took so long to confirm the existence of exoplanets in the first place: they are very small and very dark. Most exoplanets have been confirmed thanks to so-called “transit” in front of their parent star, producing a blown-own planetary silhouette. Astronomers have worked to pull much more useful data from these transits than simple size and speed, and this MIT paper represents a major step toward that goal. By looking at the fluctuations in any light spilling around the edges of an alien world, these researchers can gain some insight into its atmosphere. Particularly, the team can derive some real information about the clouds that sit on top of this atmosphere.

The technique starts with a climate model that uses predicted pressure values to predict how different substances will behave on the surface of a given planet. This gives the team a mixture of gaseous products to model, and the software then looks at how these gasses might interact on the surface of an alien world with particular properties. The software spits out a prediction for the spectrographic readings we’d expect to be associated with each of these possible cloud formations. After that, all they need to do is compare their actual readings to the list of predictions — if any of the values fits observation too well to be coincidence, that’s probably our culprit.

The team used Kepler 7b as a test bed for its technique, and their readings suggest that the planet has clouds made of vaporized rock. On Earth these substances would be solid, or at most liquid near the planet’s interior. However Kepler 7b is absolutely gargantuan (one reason it was one of the first five confirmed exoplanets) and orbits less than a twentieth of as far from its star as the Earth does from Sol; sometimes referred to as a “hot Jupiter,” Kepler is a nightmarish furnace to make Venus look hospitable.

NASA’s TESS mission could make even these findings look tame.

These incredible rock-clouds are just another bullet point on the list of reasons exoplanetologists have the coolest scientific conferences. Their results often read like the ramblings of a science fiction author, narrating a magellan-like voyage through a universe far too surreal to ever actually exist. Worlds have been shown to rain diamond, or simply to be composed almost entirely of it. Others have multiple sunsets or abnormally long or short years. Astronomers have found planets that are several times older than our Sun, and others that are younger than our upright ancestors. The search for alien planets is the search for the edges of what’s possible, and techniques like this one are proving that we are very far from finding them.

While Kepler was mankind’s first tailored planet hunter, NASA is already well underway on its successor: the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. TESS should take our understanding of exoplanets to a new level, and unlike many areas of astronomy, in this case the tinier the detail of the observation the more relatable it is to the average person. It’s hard to imagine a super-Jupiter, but easier to imagine clouds. Exoplanetology will almost certainly be one of the most publicly lauded areas of astronomy in years to come.

Guanethidine-induced adrenergic sympathectomy augments endoneurial perfusion and lowers endoneurial microvascular resistance.
Chronic administration of guanethidine sulfate in the rat induces a selective adrenergic neuropathy. We studied the effects of guanethidine-induced adrenergic sympathectomy on rat sciatic nerve blood flow (NBF), microvascular resistance (MR), vessel caliber and norepinephrine (NE) content. A control group of animals was studied following chronic administration of mammalian Ringer's solution. NBF and MR were measured with an endoneurial microelectrode, using the technique of hydrogen clearance (HC). Following HC, the sciatic nerve was perfused with India Ink, removed, frozen and sectioned. Measurements were made of endoneurial microvessel numbers, diameter, circumference and area. The contralateral sciatic nerve was removed for measurements of NE content. In guanethidine-treated animals we observed elevated NBF, reduced MR and dilated microvessels. Numbers of microvessels and fascicular areas were similar to controls. NE content was markedly reduced following sympathectomy. These studies suggest that NBF, unlike cerebral blood flow (CBF), is regulated by its adrenergic input. Removal of adrenergic innervation of the vasa nervorum appears to result in a loss of tonic vasoconstrictive action.

Lapis Lazuli Mens Rings. Add-ons have become favored by both men and women, the factors why they choose all of them are very different. Ladies would you like to look great as well as want their outfits becoming completed because of the jewellery they wear. Using this into consideration, a woman will usually use the proper earrings, necklaces or bracelets in line with the garments she has opted for.. Men conversely don’t have equivalent factors because the ladies. They could in addition look at the advantages they will have so far as the appearance are worried, however they are additionally into showing their energy and status. Regardless of what they might be using or even for exactly what occasion, males whom like using jewellery will do therefore simply because they would also like to deliver an email.

Along with the cost of transportation, it is of extreme importance to take into account the factors like risk while driving, the wear and tear of the road, bad weather condition and many more. All these factors have a direct impact on the safety of your car. So make sure that you have hired experienced and licensed transportation service like provided by auto shipping Danbury team. Going forward with such team can give you enormous benefits and can end up with the worth hiring service.

I'm using a knoppix live cd (recommended by uni) to compile and run c programs off a usb drive - practice makes perfect. I get compile error messages when not done properly, warning messages, etc which is good. But when I try to run the program nothing happens. So for example, to compile test.c (which displays a simple printf statement), I would type:. $ gcc -o test test.c. Then to run the program, I type:. $ test. And nothing happens. It just goes to the next line, ready to take in another command. Why?

Development Strategy and Feasibility Study of Income Generation Projects in Machakhela National Parks. Commissioned by UNDP, the Goal of the project was to identify potential income generation projects for Machakhela National Park and prepare technical and economic feasibility analysis regarding the selected projects, evaluate the risks associated with the implementation of the projects in terms of their impact on environment and biodiversity and provide relevant risk mitigation strategy. Except that, the impact assessment of new road to Chakvistavi village on Mtirala National Park was included as the part of the project. The main purpose of the impact assessment was to identify actions to maximize benefits for the NP and mitigate potential negative impacts caused by increased number of visitors due to improved access.

Regardless of the amount by which personal lending increases, what is important is the availability of help for those who get themselves into difficulty, and we may see an increase in the number of people in difficulty if interest rates rise towards the end of the year. I know that that would cause pain to a great many of our constituents, so it is important to get the system right now.

With a supportive FCA framework already in place, a fairly minor amendment to the Bill could effectively set a fee structure that would activate the provision of free debt management plans by authorised firms. I hope that my Front-Bench colleagues agree that action is needed soon, and that the Bill represents a timely vehicle for the necessary change.

I believe this to be a truly cross-party issue, and that the Bill needs to be amended to give people in debt more security and access to free, high-quality plans that help them to manage their finances. If interest rates do go up any time soon, the debt management sector may be called on to give even more support than it provides now, and this is therefore a good time to strengthen the system.

Establishment of a turkey cecal cell line and development of turkey coccidia within the cells.
Cells were dispersed from cecal tissues of 1- to 2-day-old turkeys using a mixture of collagenase and dispase to enrich for epithelial cells. The initial culture produced from these cells (TCC) appeared to be heterogeneous, but, as the cells were cultured through 25 passages, they assumed a more fibroblastic appearance. Cellular invasion of the TCC by two species of turkey coccidia, Eimeria adenoeides and Eimeria meleagrimitis, was not enhanced, as compared with invasion in turkey kidney cells (TKC), the cell culture system standardly used to study the avian coccidia in vitro. However, early development by one of the species, E. meleagrimitis, was markedly increased in the TCC (Passages 6 through 19) over that in TKC. Thirty to 42% of the parasites that invaded the TCC developed beyond the sporozoite stage, as compared with 5% development in TKC. Mature first-generation schizonts were observed within 24 hr postinoculation in the TCC, but not until 48 hr in the kidney cells. There was no evidence that development of the second generation was initiated in either the TCC or kidney cells.

Five years ago, Bruce R. Spector was a partner in a little Washington cable TV company when he thought he saw the future. And for all the breathless whiz-bang hype of the Information Age, it wasn't cable.. Humble as it seemed -- and as pitiful a financial shape as it was in after a series of failed or struggling leveraged buyouts -- Spector and partner Joseph L. Mathias IV decided the future was radio. Based on that insight, they launched Benchmark Communications, a Baltimore company they hope to take public later this year, one that an industry peer says could be worth up to $160 million.. Benchmark has been on an acquisition spree since Congress approved the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which let companies such as Benchmark own many more stations in the same radio markets. This month alone, it has bought six stations to bring its total to 33, all in the southeastern United States, in small cities where the company can avoid such giant players as Westinghouse Electric Corp.

When I first started diving, I experienced quite a bit of motion sickness. It would never be a problem before a dive, but it would be a real problem upon surfacing. I would feel nauseaus at the surface and on the boat, and the feeling would slowly fade once back on land.. I learned a few tricks to minimize motion sickness. Medication probably helped the most, but I also ate better and drank more water. I also chugged a special soda immediately before diving; the soda contains an acid that counters motion sickness.. Over time, I noticed that my motion sickness decreased. I would dive unprepared, which is to say I hadn’t taken the medication or drank the soda, but I would feel relatively well after the dive.. I still take all precautions before a dive, just in case. However, it seems that the body adapts and naturally becomes less susceptible to motion sickness over time.. Good tips for combating motion sickness while diving!

Health Care In The Suburbs: An Analysis Of Suburban Poverty And Health Care Access.
There are 16.9 million Americans living in poverty in the suburbs-more than in cities or rural communities. Despite recent increases in suburban poverty, the perception of the suburbs as areas of uniform affluence remains, and there has been little research into health care barriers experienced by people living in these areas. The objectives of this study were to compare patterns of insurance coverage and health care access in suburban, urban, and rural areas using national survey data from 2005 to 2015 and to compare outcomes by geography before and after the Affordable Care Act took effect. We found that nearly 40 percent of the uninsured population lived in suburban areas. Though unadjusted rates of health care access were better in suburban areas, compared to urban and rural communities, this advantage was greatly reduced after income and other demographics are accounted for. Overall, a substantial portion of the US population residing in the suburbs lacked health insurance and experienced difficulties accessing care. Increased policy attention is needed to address these challenges for vulnerable populations living in the suburbs.

Title III Ruling to Effect Real Estate Market? 3 Experts Weigh In

Friday marked a big win for entrepreneurs and the everyday consumer when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted 3-1 for the next step in equity crowd funding. The approval of Title III of the JOBS Act is a long-awaited ruling that has both experts and consumers talking about the impact it will have on our country's economy—and the real estate market.

Once the ruling goes into effect, companies can be financed by anyone with the cash to opt in, without undergoing the public registration process. This is a huge move, as it's the first time in the history of the SEC (that's 82 years!) that retail investors---otherwise known as your everyday joe--will be able to invest in private businesses.

So how will this impact the real estate market? Below, three industry experts weigh in on what the ruling will mean for our economy, and the $2.5 billion real estate crowdfunding industry.

Scott Picken, author of Property Going Global and CEO and founder of Wealth Migrate, the 10th largest global real estate crowdfunding platform.“I don’t believe there is going to be a catalytic change overnight, but this will have a catalytic affect in the long term. The bottom line is that the wealth gap, the difference between the have’s and the have not’s, is the greatest challenge we have on the planet, and it is only getting worse. Now with technology and this change in legislation, the bottom 99 percent will have the same access to the same opportunities and partners as the top 1 percent. What most people don’t understand is that this will have a big impact in America, but a far greater impact in the emerging world. This is going to change the real estate industry forever and also put a case forward to a global change in legislation.”Marshall Saunders, co-founder and managing partner of SaundersDailey, a real estate crowdfunding platform connecting investors to residential real estate opportunities in select markets throughout the Midwest.“[The ruling] is not as wide open and accepting of non-accredited investors as I had hoped for. But it's a start. We will make the best out of the rules and will consider it a toe in the door. With good results, and consumer demand, we will see that door opening wider and wider in the coming years. The bottom line is that non-accredited investors now have a way of participating in equity crowdfunding. It will change the way America invests, both in business startups and real estate. The wait has been hard, but understandable. The U.S. Congress has no idea the magnitude of what it was dumping on the SEC when it passed the JOBS Act in 2012. Given that fact, the SEC has done the best that they can to move this forward.”

“Title III was never intended to have a competitive impact on the established markets. By design it's intended to enable entrepreneurs and real estate sponsors that have had difficulty raising much-needed capital from traditional channels to be able to do so more efficiently from individual investors, which is precisely what it will facilitate and make a meaningful impact on for those that access this new ecosystem.”

Only time will tell exactly how Title III will impact real estate, but it seems as if times are changing, 3-1.

The VSG expression sites of Trypanosoma brucei: multipurpose tools for the adaptation of the parasite to mammalian hosts.
The variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes of Trypanosoma brucei are transcribed in telomeric loci termed VSG expression sites (ESs). Despite permanent initiation of transcription in most if not all of these multiple loci, RNA elongation is abortive except in bloodstream forms where full transcription up to the VSG occurs only in a single ES at a time. The ESs active in bloodstream forms are polycistronic and contain several genes in addition to the VSG, named ES-associated genes (ESAGs). So far 12 ESAGs have been identified, some of which are present only in some ESs. Most of these genes encode surface proteins and this list includes different glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins such as the heterodimeric receptor for the host transferrin (ESAG7/6), integral membrane proteins such as the receptor-like transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (ESAG4) and a surface transporter (ESAG10). An interesting exception is ESAG8, which may encode a cell cycle regulator involved in the differentiation of long slender into short stumpy bloodstream forms. Several ESAGs belong to multigene families including pseudogenes and members transcribed out of the ESs, named genes related to ESAGs (GRESAGs). However, some ESAGs (7, 6 and 8) appear to be restricted to the ESs. Most of these genes can be deleted from the active ES without apparently affecting the phenotype of bloodstream form trypanosomes, probably either due to the expression of ESAGs from 'inactive' ESs (ESAG7/6) or due to the expression of GRESAGs (in particular, GRESAGs4 and GRESAGs1). At least three ESAGs (ESAG7, ESAG6 and SRA) share the evolutionary origin of VSGs. The presence of these latter genes in ESs may confer an increased capacity of the parasite for adaptation to various mammalian hosts, as suggested in the case of ESAG7/6 and proven for SRA, which allows T. brucei to infect humans. Similarly, the existence of a collection of slightly different ESAG4s in the multiple ESs might provide the parasite with adenylyl cyclase isoforms that may regulate growth in response to different environmental conditions. The high transcription rate and high recombination level that prevail in VSG ESs may have favored the generation and/or recruitment in these sites of genes whose hyper-evolution allows adaptation to a larger variety of hosts.

These golf shoes are clearly geared towards the younger crowd and why not with a young upstart golfer in Rickie Fowler as their spokesman, Puma clearly knows the direction they're going in. So would I, a 42 year old hacker, father of 3 be able to rock these pastel head turners. Read on!

Features
Last year I had the opportunity to review some Puma Tipper Golf Shoes and was thoroughly impressed with the technology used in the shoes to make them so lightweight yet so sturdy for all kinds of golfing conditions. This Special Edition Cell Fusion model doesn't disappoint. You notice right away from holding the SE model the Smart Quill technology. This year Puma takes it to another level with replaceable SmartQuill spikes with Fast Twist 2 directional locking technology for more grip. The Smart Quills combined with the iCell technology in the forefoot and heel of the shoe makes this not only more comfortable than the Tippers I reviewed but also give you better traction to the ground during your swing.

Looks
Puma doesn't pull any punches with its SE Cell Fusion model. The retro two-tone Puma stripe in yellow and green is eye catching to say the least. When I first wore them you should of heard the comments from my fashion conscience daughters as well from some of my playing partners. With the crystal blue base these are the slickest golf shoes Puma has released. It took some getting use to, the color combination but after awhile wearing with them with a Puma shirt and pants with similar color palettes I quickly got over it. From the pictures you'll also note the contrasting piping shoelaces. Puma gives you three extra sets of shoe laces to change it up whenever you like, a nice touch.

Feel and Comfort
After a few rounds, the SE Puma Cell Fusions proved to be a great lightweight, sturdy and comfortable golf shoe. I wore them straight out of the box no break in period here. My feet never seem to get tired or fatigued even in the heat we've been getting recently in the Ottawa area. The Smart Quill spikes provided great traction for all types of golf shots whether it was on the fairway, the bunker or the rough. The Cell Fusion's waterproof full-grain leather upper managed to keep me dry in some torrential rains recently and that can't be said for all golf shoes.

Conclusion
If you want a retro stylish looking golf shoe that Rickie Fowler wears, the SE Cell Fusion fits the bill. If you're a little more conservation the Cell Fusion's also comes in Black/White/Red and White/Snorkel Blue. Don't worry if you have a hard time matching them with rest of your golf wardrobe because Puma has some great SE apparel to go along with these shoes. Stay tuned for more reviews!

After a bit of getting use to I even managed to pull off wearing these golf shoes. How can you not like golf shoes that are so lightweight and comfortable and actually help your golf game. Better traction and stability awaits you with the Cell Fusion Special Edition Golf Shoes . SE Cell Fusion shoes can be bought online at the Puma Store. Retail value $180.00 USD. Trendy Golf also sells them as well as Fairway Styles.

Dutch is the sole official language, and is the language of education, government, business, and the media.[6] Over 60% of the population speaks Dutch as a mother tongue,[43] and most of the rest of the population speaks it as a second language. In 2004 Suriname became an associate member of the Dutch Language Union.[44]).[45].[46] and Portuguese are also used.. The public discourse about Suriname’s languages is a part of an ongoing debate about the country’s national identity.[46] The use of the popular Sranan became associated with nationalist politics after its public use by former dictator Dési Bouterse in the 1980s,[46] and groups descended from escaped slaves might resent it.[46] Some propose to change the national language to English, so as to improve links to the Caribbean and North America, or to Spanish, as a nod to Suriname’s location in South America, although it has no Spanish-speaking neighbours.[46]

The Walt Disney Company is well known for supporting Children’s Hospitals in the communities where it has a presence. In Florida they’ve built a whole pavilion for the Florida Hospital for Children. In California, the support for the Children’s Hospital of Orange County is great. That tradition will continue with the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort with Disney donating $3.1 million USD to fund Disney-themed play spaces and therapeutic play activities at children’s hospitals across China.

Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger announced the gift at the Shanghai Children’s Medical Center. Over the course of the five-year program, the donation will provide more than 50 hospitals in China with play rooms and therapeutic play activities. Disney will also donate Shanghai Disneyland theme park tickets to support children and their families as they undergo and recover from treatment.

“In honor of the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, we are creating a bit of Disney magic where it is needed most. With our gift of 20million RMB and tickets to our new theme park, we hope to bring happiness and laughter to children and families in hospitals across the country by creating opportunities to play and spend quality time together,” Iger said.

The donation will be administered by the Shanghai Charity Foundation for children’s hospitals in and around Shanghai, and by the China Soong Ching Ling Foundation for hospitals in the rest of China. The play curriculum and training will be designed and implemented by Right To Play, an international non-profit organization that uses the transformative power of play to educate and empower children to overcome adversity.

“Over the past few years, the Shanghai Children’s Medical Center has built several children’s play spaces with support from The Walt Disney Company,” said Jiang Zhongyi, Director of Shanghai Children’s Medical Center. “This new fund not only showcases Disney’s social responsibility and support for children, but also helps promote innovative new therapeutic play concepts that are helping transform children’s healthcare.”

Disney’s support of children’s hospitals dates back to the 1930s when Walt Disney would visit with children, often accompanied by Disney characters and animators. Today that support includes millions of dollars in annual grants and donations that provide play spaces, theme park tickets, first-run movies, care packages, in-kind support, and hospital visits from beloved Disney characters.

Disney has already supported several children’s hospitals in Shanghai through the development of play spaces, play therapy training, and character visits. Disney VoluntEARS have made more than 150 hospital visits and benefited more than 12,000 children and their families.

The present invention relates to an endoscope and a sheath which detachably covers an inserting tube of the endoscope.
Conventionally, the inserting tube of an endoscope is covered with a detachable sheath that is exchanged and discarded after each endoscopic inspection in order to prevent infection between patients via the endoscope.
The sheath includes an elastic tubular portion for covering the inserting tube and a cylindrical supporting portion connected to the proximal end of the tubular portion so as to allow the inserting tube to be inserted into the tubular portion through the supporting portion. The supporting portion is provided with an air feeding conduit for feeding air into and thereby inflating the tubular portion, and a packing for sealing a gap around the inserting tube being passed therethrough to prevent leaking of the air fed into the tubular portion.
The tubular portion is formed to have an inner diameter smaller than the outer diameter of the inserting tube. When inserting the inserting tube into the tubular portion in order to be covered therewith, the tubular portion is inflated by feeding air into it. The air feeding is stopped after the inserting tube has been fully inserted into the sheath so that the tubular portion shrinks and adheres on the inserting tube. In this manner, the inserting tube is covered with the tubular portion of the sheath without having any portion where the tubular portion floats therefrom. The sheath is put on the inserting tube in a manner as above since a floating portion of the sheath may cause the sheath to be snagged and even torn on a body wall when the inserting tube is inserted into a human body.
The conventional sheath, however, is relatively expensive since it is provided with the packing and the conduit for air feeding. Thus, the sheath has been one of the causes of increasing the endoscopic inspection cost.

Brussels grows specimens only under carefully controlled conditions, meticulously training each tree with wire and pruning over a period of years. If upon the tree's arrival some leaves have dropped or turned slightly brown that does not mean the bonsai is unhealthy. Defoliation is the natural result of being in the low-light environment of a shipping box. When you receive your tree, place the box in a shaded area to unpack. Inspect tree for damage to branches or leaves. Water soil if dry, and place the tree in. For more information on care and training visit Brussel's Bonsai on the Web.

Arteriovenous malformations of the tongue: a spectrum of disease.
To examine our vascular anomalies team's experience with tongue arteriovenous malformations (AVM) with specific emphasis on the spectrum on disease and surgical management. Retrospective chart review of 11 patients (10 female, 1 male), discovered from 1997 to 2005 with histological, radiographic, and clinical characteristics consistent with tongue AVM. Four patients displayed advanced disease with malformations involving the tongue, floor of mouth, and neck. Contributions from multiple feeding arteries were identified by angiography as each patient reported a prior history of surgical or embolic procedures. These lesions required preoperative embolization and extensive resection with complex reconstruction (mean operating time, 10.9 hr). One patient had evidence of recurrent disease (mean follow-up, 24.6 mo). In contrast, seven patients presented with discreet tongue malformations with a single feeding lingual artery. These patients reported no prior intervention, required only one resection (mean operating time, 2.8 hr), and have shown no evidence of recurrence (mean follow-up, 11 mo). Slight histologic differences between advanced versus focal tongue AVM were identified. This study suggests that tongue AVM can occur within a spectrum of disease with different clinical presentations, radiographic findings, and histology among patients with focal versus advanced lesions. Inadequate treatment is thought to contribute to collateral flow and disease progression in advanced AVM, making further management difficult. However, focal tongue AVM may represent early lesions that are more amenable to surgical management.

Recommendations for new riders. Carry extra food and water.. In winter time – Don’t rely on minimum lighting requirements. Consider carrying a front light. It is strongly recommended that riders use more that one rear red light.. Wear a reflective vest, reflective leg bands, and other brightly reflective clothing.. Carry a tool kit, spare inner tubes (and patches), and perhaps a spare fold-up tire. Be sure your pump is working.. Be prepared for weather. Make sure you take along clothes to protect you from cold and wet conditions.. Mud Guards are strongly recommended.. Ziploc bags are useful for keeping phones & food dry.. Road surfaces vary. Narrow tires suffer more impact punctures but wider tires have more drag. If riding a mountain bike, consider using slick tires.. Use a sensible gear range.. Author: Colm Staunton

The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for secure distribution of program content, which are directed to the prevention of unauthorized copying and/or distribution of the program content.
Program content may include application programs, such as video game programs, word processing programs, spread sheet programs, etc.; and system programs, such as operating systems, boot programs, etc. Program content, such as computer programs, are typically distributed to end-users by way of transportable storage media, such as CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, etc., which contain the program content. Program content may also be distributed to end-users by way of downloading the program content over a network, such as from a server to the user over the Internet.
The conventional methods for distributing program content are not secure because unauthorized copies thereof may be made and shared among a plurality of end-users. For example, if a computer program is distributed to a particular end-user by way of a storage medium, that user may permit unauthorized copies of the computer program to be distributed and stored on equipment controlled by other end-users. Typically, these unauthorized copies are stored on hard disk drives, CD-ROMs, and the like. Similarly, if the computer program is distributed to the end-user by way of transmission over a network, unauthorized copies of the computer program may be made and distributed to other users. For example, once the computer program is stored on the authorized end-user's equipment, he or she may forward a copy of the computer program to another user by way of a storage medium (e.g., an optical disk, a magnetic disk, etc.) or by way of an attachment to an electronic mail message.
Accordingly, there are needs in the art for new methods and apparatus for the secure distribution of program content to end-users, which ameliorates the problems associated with the proliferation of unauthorized copies of the program content.

Curious how your email marketing fares against the average email marketer? Silverpop’s 2012 Email Marketing Metrics Benchmark Study has those figures. Check ‘em:. 1. Identify the trouble spots. If your open rate is significantly beneath even the average, you’re probably dealing with a largely inactive list. That could drive a decision to launch a re-engagement initiative or rethink your acquisition process.. 2. Use the numbers to lobby for the additional budget resources you need to improve your program. Be sure to focus on the areas that have the greatest potential to help you achieve departmental or corporate goals, such as higher revenue, reduced expenses, more conversions or better customer retention.. Remember, benchmarks tell you what’s average, not necessarily what’s target for your industry or your program. But they can offer some insight into what’s typical and motivate you to keep improving your own program.

Inside Intelligence: About Those Political Plans...

The attorney general has $12 million in his campaign account and has done a terrible job of keeping secret his ambition to run for governor of the state. The governor, meanwhile, has three years left in his term, is just back from a fruitless run for president and is trying to knock down any talk that he might be a lame duck. He's done that by saying he might run for another term in the middle office and hasn't ruled out another run for president, should the stars align.

So what if they ran into each other in 2014? The insiders think Greg Abbott would win. Only a third picked Rick Perry in that hypothetical head-to-head, while 60 percent would bet on the AG.

We asked about real races, too. With four well-funded candidates (from a total of 10) seeking the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, 62 percent of the insiders expect a runoff in that race; about a third expect it to end in the first round, on May 29.

The only current officeholder in the race for the open seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, state Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, is the insiders' favorite to win that contest. While 56 percent chose Chisum, 39 percent think the winner will be Christi Craddick.

We closed with an essay question this week, asking the insiders — on the eve of a new filing period for political races in Texas — who might provide the biggest surprises.

As always, we have attached the full set of verbatim answers to the questions. A sampling follows:

Who would win a Republican gubernatorial primary between Greg Abbott and Rick Perry?

• "At this point, just about anybody could beat Perry in the Republican primary--which is why I don't think Perry will run again. If Dewhurst wins a 6-year U.S. Senate term, even he might decide to challenge Perry. Then, Dewhurst could have the job he always wanted and also appoint his replacement in Washington. Such a deal."

• "What are you kidding?! After that presidential debacle it will be ANYBODY BUT PERRY!"

• "The frost is off that pumpkin. This presidential primary wasn't exactly a Phil Gramm '96 failure. It was an embarrassment of the state. His repeated failures were a reflection on all Texans. The R's would rather shoot their own dog than have D's shoot it for them."

• "The last Texan to beat Rick Perry in a Texas primary was... Gimme a minute. It'll come to me. Damn, what was his name?"

• "Question assumes Perry would actually run again, and Abbott would have the political chops to take him on. He doesn't."

• "Abbott's main, and perhaps only, argument that he can use in unseating Perry, is that 'it's time for him to go.' That didn't work for KBH. Republicans are going to have a hard time throwing out Perry without a really good reason. What's he done that Republicans have really hated?"

• "They both appeal to the same segment of Republican primary voters. Perry has long-term relationships on his side, but Abbott has a mostly unvarnished record on his."

Will there be a runoff in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate this year?

• "Yes, and it will be ugly."

• "Money like love conquers ALL! Hello Senator Dewhurst!"

• "Dewhurst should have a comfortable margin but under 50% because of the size of the field."

• "Dewhurst will drown out the others on TV and win without a runoff."

• "Still can't see a combo of Cruz/Leppert/James getting to 50%, but the later we keep moving the date back, that probability increases exponentially."

• "Whether or not Dewhurst can get to 50% in the first round is an open question, but he better hope he can. A low turnout runoff would be a nightmare scenario for him, and would render his name ID and financial advantages irrelevant. Look for the Dew to launch a takedown of Cruz in the next couple of months."

• "It depends on if some of the lesser candidates continue with their vanity campaigns."

• "Absent a major misstep by Dewhurst, there will be no runoff. Polls that say otherwise are not credible."

Who will win the race for Elizabeth Ames Jones' seat on the Texas Railroad Commission?

• "Who's for eliminating the agency?"

• "Not the most-qualified, the one who has worked in the industry for decades. Instead it’ll likely be the flake who’s-out-but-may-now-be-back-in after winning the Ft. Worth straw poll, or the entitled daughter of a certain former speaker, or the far right's favorite legislator."

• "In a down ballot this cycle, Chisum's history of social conservatism gives him a huge edge."

• "The one woman with the last name people have heard before? Yeah, that one."

• "Would hope one of the others, but the name CRADDICK will be the most recognized name in this race"

• "Becky Berger will be disappointed to learn that 'Inside Intelligence' does not have her in the race. A runoff in the GOP is likely between Craddick and one of the white guys. The winner of that will be the next Commissioner."

• "Warren has all of the advantages of experience in the industry, personal connections galore, and decades as a public figure. He's campaigning with all the energy of a 20-year-older to boot. Christi might make it in politics one day, but this isn't the day."

• "All one had to do is look at the resumes. I believe Chisum will be strong and have what it takes to win it. Those that support him publicly, however, will feel the pain next session. Dads hate when someone messes with their daughter."

• "Names are powerful. Look at Carrillo, the odds-on, industry-backed favorite, an incumbent no less, getting upended by Porter, a complete unknown. Craddick could win this on name alone."

As soon as election dates are set, the federal redistricting judges have said they will set a new deadline for campaign filing, allowing candidates to sign up for races, to drop out, or to amend filings they made earlier. What will be the biggest surprise? [Editor's note: We asked this before the court set a May 29 primary and a March 9 filing deadline.]

• "Pete Gallego might actually have a real race."

• "A last minute serious challenger to a 'comfy' incumbent."

• "An actual election!"

• "Doggett switches to U.S. Senate race."

• "Debra Medina for Railroad Commissioner"

• "Who doesn't run again!"

• "North Texas state senate races"

• "More House members announcing their retirement."

• "No surprises. It's hard to keep a secret in our political world. The birds like to sing."

• "If I told you it would not be a surprise."

• "How about the biggest surprise is that the courts decided to act after wasting weeks of time and tons of money?

Treatment o f Ln2(S 0 4)3 • nH 20 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm. Eu, Gd ; n -8, 9) with phenelzine dihydrogen sulfate, (phzH2) S 0 4, in 1 N H2S 0 4 yields polymeric complexes with the general formula [L n (S 0 4)2(H 20) 2(phzH)], which contain the phzH+ cation as a ligand. The compounds have been characterized by elem ental analyses, X-ray powder patterns, thermal methods, magnetic susceptibilities and spectroscopic (IR, Raman, electronic diffuse reflec tance and solid-state emission f -f spectra) studies.

This invention relates to a device for disposing of a recording medium by forming thereon a provisional record of a pattern, such as a picture, and by thereafter processing the provisional record into a final record of the pattern. The device may be, for example, an electrostatic facsimile receiver.
In a facsimile transmission and reception system, a transmitter supplies a receiver or receivers with signals representative of a picture or the like. In a conventional electrostatic facsimile receiver, a continuous recording paper is caused to pass by a recording unit for forming thereon latent images of a plurality of successive pictures and is subsequently fed into a developing and fixing unit for developing and fixing the latent images into visible reproductions of the respective pictures. In such a receiver, particularly for the known runlength-coded signals or for similar signals with redundancy reduction, the speed at which the recording paper runs by the recording unit towards the developing and fixing unit is adjusted in compliance with the speed selected at the transmitter in consideration of the density of lines or the like of each picture. As a result of the variation in the speed of feed, unevenness or irregularity in developing and fixing has been unavoidable to deteriorate the reproduced pictures. Deterioration of a record has been inevitable also in a device for disposing of a continuous sheet or separate sheets of recording medium when the medium is caused to pass by a recording unit towards a provisional record processing unit with various speeds of feed.

Unverricht-Lundborg disease with cystatin B gene abnormalities.
The clinical, neurophysiologic, and genetic findings in two Japanese patients with the Unverricht-Lundborg type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy are described. The cystatin B gene of Patient 1 exhibited expansion of the dodecamer (12-mer) repeat located in the 5' region and a point mutation (G-->A mutation) in exon 2. The cystatin B gene of Patient 2 exhibited homozygous expansion of the dodecamer repeat. Both parents of Patient 2 were heterozygous carriers. The two patients had a similar clinical course, and their symptoms were similar to those of previously reported patients in Finland. They both had a good response to zonisamide and low-dose primidone. We recommend that zonisamide and low-dose primidone should be introduced as the first drugs of choice for the treatment of patients with the Unverricht-Lundborg type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy.

The Best Diet for Weight Loss

As an obesity physician, I survey all of my patients about their diets. I also make note of the patients who are the most successful at losing and keeping off their weight. There is ONE trait that every successful patient shares in common. Is it their carbohydrate count? Are they vegans? Do they track their calories on an app? Are they on amphetamines? The answer may shock you…. or maybe not.

The answer: They all found their own way to sustainably lower their energy intake.

When I get a new patient coming in for weight loss, I give them my book The Fat Loss Prescription (Get through Amazon here,). I tend to push a more “Mediterranean” style low carbohydrate diet, which focuses on foods that are shown to improve mortality AND satiety (the satiety is important for sustainability). But as I work with the patients throughout the months, the diet changes into something that fits the patient’s personal preferences and life schedule.

Here is just a handful of ways they do it:

They literally keep their same diet, but found a way to eat less of it. Maybe they eat slower now or maybe they keep the extra servings in the kitchen. Many will use salad plates instead of dinner plates to trick their mind into thinking they ate just as much. Some of then do in fact track their calories with an app and when they get to their calorie goal, they stop. This one always makes me smile because I think it is less than ideal but who the hell am I to judge?

They went to a low carb or vegan diet (or another diet that restricts food groups). How could I lump these things together? These diets totally cut out either a whole macronutrient (like carbohydrates) or food groups (animal products). Paleo works as well for the same reason. These also entail (should anyway) increasing vegetables and other high satiety foods. Either way, many will not need to track their calories because their calories will be lowered automatically if they follow the diet correctly.

They replaced meals. People think protein shakes are just for meat heads. However, there is a lot of evidence that replacing your meals with a low energy protein shake will increase your chances at weight loss success. You replace a high calorie meal with a low calorie, high satiating protein shake. Makes sense.

They practice fasting. I have had some patients go to an intermittent fasting style of dieting. Whether they cut 1-2 days or restrict when they eat during the day, they find that this works better than just keeping calories controlled all day every day.

I am getting quite annoyed at the arguing over which diet is best for weight loss. There are physicians, researchers, fitness professionals, etc. who demand that their way is best. The most vocal are the low carbohydrate advocates as they blame obesity on insulin. I am an advocate of a low carbohydrate diet (especially for my insulin resistant/pre diabetic/type 2 diabetic patients). However, you would be astonished at how many of my patients who are successful who do not follow a low carbohydrate diet. It would be nice if we could just shift our efforts from arguing online to helping those who are actually in need of weight loss.

Improving the quality of operation notes: Effect of using proforma, audit and education sessions.
Both from a medical and legal point of view, the quality of operative notes are important. In this study we hypothesized that the quality of operation notes could be improved by audit, education session and using a proforma. A total of 150 operation notes were audited for compliance with the Royal College of Surgeons guidelines. Results were announced in-clinic training session and guidelines were discussed. An aide-memoire containing guideline parameters placed in the operating theaters. After eight months, operation reports were re-audited on an equal number of patients. An operative note proforma was developed and third audit was carried out. The results of each audit were compared. In the first audit, it was found that fourteen parameters were written with more than 90% accuracy. The first audit revealed seven poor areas in documentation: time of operation (0%), identification of emergency/elective procedure (0%), identification of any prosthesis or devices used (65.3%), details of closure technique (36.6%), name of anesthesiologist (0%), patient position (1.3%), and amount of bleeding (0%). In the second audit there was an incomplete, but significant improvement in these seven parameters (28%, 28.6%, 82%, 75.3%, 31.3%, 32%, and 34% respectively). Following introduction of the proforma; third audit cycle demonstrated a clear improvement in operation note documentation with at least 80% compliance in all parameters. This study revealed that the accuracy of the operating room documents can be improved through audits, education of surgeon and using proformas. The use of proforma provides much better results.

Outlook and Market Review - Third Quarter 2015. PDF File:. Summary:. The Bureau of Economic Analysis revised third quarter U.S. GDP growth to 2.1% from the flash report of only 1.5%. Most of the revised gain was due to inventory adjustments, which may constrain fourth quarter growth. On a year-over-year basis the economy continues to track along a 2.2% to 2.4% growth trend. Inflation continues to be below the Fed target of 2% for both the core and headline personal consumption expenditure (PCE) indices. Weak demand and low energy prices are expected to keep inflation below the Fed target throughout 2015 and most of 2016. The unemployment rate is 5%, close to what may be full employment given current conditions. Nevertheless, capacity utilization remains well below full employment levels with ample room for expansion before excess demand pressures and bottlenecks introduce inflation pressures.

I've had mine for about 9 mos or so and was looking to try and get rid of the stuff the phone accumulates that we just don't need. Invalid extensions, unused files etc. I understand that a data/cache wipe is one way. Is there a specific way to do this? I'm running BB 0.4 and I'm about to install Indigo Glass. I was hoping to start over fresh with the droid. I have Titanium Backup and Rom Manager. Will a quick backup with one of those save all of my essential data? If not, how do I save the good stuff and not the bad? Thanks, all.

The stroke navigator: meaningful use of the electronic health record to efficiently report inpatient stroke care quality.
To facilitate high-quality inpatient care for stroke patients, we built a system within our electronic health record (EHR) to identify stroke patients while they are in the hospital; capture necessary data in the EHR to minimize the burden of manual abstraction for stroke performance measures, decreasing daily time requirement from 2 hours to 15 minutes; generate reports using an automated process; and electronically transmit data to third parties. Provider champions and support from the EHR development team ensured that we balanced the needs of the hospital with those of frontline providers. This work summarizes the development and implementation of our stroke quality system.

Blood pressure is the major driving force for plaque formation in aortic-constricted ApoE-/- mice.
Using an aortic constriction model in mice, we studied whether the increase in pressure or the activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and its main receptors is the main driving force for plaque progression. Male ApoE mice underwent sham surgery or placement of a suprarenal silver clip around the aorta (AoC). Half the group was treated with the selective AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (30 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks. Anesthetized mean arterial pressure (MAP) was increased in AoC mice compared to sham (106 +/- 3 versus 90 +/- 1 mmHg, P < 0.001). Losartan reduced MAP in sham mice (78 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.01) but not in AoC (AoC losartan 104 +/- 2 mmHg). Plasma renin concentration (PRC) was increased in AoC mice compared to sham [1.6 +/- 0.3 versus 0.8 +/- 0.2 milliGoldblatt units (mGU)/ml, P < 0.001]. Losartan treatment augmented this difference (18.7 +/- 3.7 versus 4.6 +/- 1.7 mGU/ml, P < 0.01). AT2 receptor mRNA expression was increased 5.8-fold by aortic constriction in thoracic aorta (P < 0.05) and the major site for expression of the AT2 receptor protein was within the plaques. The plaque area was increased in AoC mice compared to sham (0.61 +/- 0.09 versus 0.07 +/- 0.01%, P < 0.001); however, losartan did not alter plaque area. Our data do not support a role for the AT1 receptor in the progression of atherosclerosis in this model, since blockade with losartan did not alter plaque distribution. Furthermore, we found no support for the counteraction of atherogenesis by increased activity of the RAS acting on the AT2 receptor. Our data suggest that increased pressure is the main driving force for atherosclerosis in this model.

My mother used to make pot roast in foil, and this evening I’m carrying on the family tradition. Tear off about a five-foot piece of 18-inch-wide aluminum foil. Set the piece of pot roast in the center of it; surround it with chunks of potato, baby carrots, and an onion, cut into chunks. Sprinkle on a couple tablespoons of minced garlic and two packets of Lipton’s Onion Soup mix. Fold the foil into a packet, creasing the seams so they’re steam-tight. Before you seal the packet, add about a quarter-cup of water. Set the packet in a baking pan and cook in the oven at 350F for about two hours. Yummy goodness. Mrs. R says you can do it in the crock-pot, but it’s just not the same. Part of it must be the ritual of preparation..

The Department of Health and Human Services has officially released the final rule for the Quality Payment Program under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA).. The Quality Payment Program, which will begin on January 1, 2017, replaces the sustainable growth rate and will reportedly allow providers to deliver more flexible, patient-centered care. According to HHS, MACRA and the Quality Payment Program will help drive the industry away from a volume-based system to value-based care models. The Quality Payment Program will reward providers for value-based care via two avenues: Advanced Alternative Payment Models (Advanced APMs) and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS).

1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to compositions for use as adhesion promoters on polyolefin substrates and to a method of applying such compositions to the polyolefin substrate. More particularly, the present invention relates to compositions containing chlorinated polyolefins for use as adhesion promoters and to a method of applying such compositions to polyolefin substrates.
2. Brief Description of the Prior Art
Polyolefins such as ethylene and propylene as well as copolymers thereof are being used in increasing amounts in the fabrication of automobile bodies and trim such as front end fascia and filler panels located between the bumper and the chassis. These materials are light weight and have excellent impact resistance. They can withstand low speed collisions much better than metal counterparts. However, to be aesthetically acceptable, the polyolefin must be painted to match the paint on the rest of the automobile. Because of the low surface tension of polyolefins, it is very difficult to adhere paint directly to the surface of the polyolefin.
It is known in the industry that the adhesion of a paint layer to a polyolefin substrate can be improved if the substrate is first treated with an adhesion promoter. Typical adhesion promoters are solutions of chlorinated polyolefins which when applied as a coating to the polyolefin substrate act as a tie layer between the polyolefin and the subsequently applied paint. However, if the adhesion promoter is not applied uniformly to the polyolefin substrate, the adhesion of the subsequently applied coating will fail.
It is an object of the present invention to provide a detectable adhesion promoting composition, that is, one which when applied to the polyolefin substrate can be determined if it has been applied uniformly to the substrate.

WHY IS THIS TOPIC IMPORTANT?. The subconscious mind and the non-voluntary behavior of our nervous system gives us much trouble in life. I, therefore, find it extremely important to understand the mechanisms and what I can do about it to gain control over my behavior on all levels of life, both body and mind.. We have all heard about the subconscious mind as something outside yourself or a part of our mind we cannot control. Sometimes it works against us and we, therefore, need to reprogram it. We know very little about it and this can be frightening, especially when we realize how much it can impact our lives.. Continue reading “Conscious vs. subconscious mind, who am I?”

Identification of ononitol and O-methyl-scyllo-inositol in pea root nodules.
Ononitol (4-O-methyl-myo-inositol) and O-methyl-scyllo-inositol were identified in pea (Pisum sativum L.) root nodules formed by twoRhizobium leguminosarum strains. Ononitol was the major soluble carbohydrate in nodules formed by strain 1045 while O-methyl-scyllo-inositol and two unidentified components were dominant in the carbohydrate pattern of the nodules formed by strain 1 a. The cyclitols were also present in the denodulated roots, but to a much smaller extent; in the above-ground plant parts only traces were found. The identification of ononitol and O-methyl-scyllo-inositol was established by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry utilizing trimethylsilyl- and acetyl-derivatives.

Tannic acid exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on formalin-induced paw edema model of inflammation in rats.
The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between anti-inflammatory effects of the natural polyphenolic compound tannic acid (CAS number: 1401-55-4) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme activity in paw edema model. Thirty-five female rats were divided into five groups. The paws of rats were injected subcutaneously in the plantar surface with formalin except for the control group. Indomethacin and tannic acid were intraperitoneally administered 1 h after formalin injection. The paws volume was measured by using vernier caliper. MPO enzyme activity was determined using 4-aminoantipyrine-phenol solution as the substrate for MPO-mediated oxidation by H2O2. About 17% and 13% edema inhibition has detected in the indomethacin-applied group, at the measurements run every other hour right after the treatment. An inhibition of 16% was found at the group treated with 25 mg/kg tannic acid. However, in the group treated with 50 mg/kg tannic acid, 15% and 7% of the edema inhibition was observed. Serum and paw tissue MPO activities were decreased in treated groups with indomethacin and tannic acid according to formalin control group. Our study results suggest that tannic acid may contribute to the treatment of inflammation by decreasing MPO enzyme activity, but the molecular mechanism is still not clear.

Enbridge gets EPA approval for 2012 oil spill cleanup plans.. Jason Manshum is an Enbridge spokesman. He says Enbridge’s plans for 20-12 include assessing how much submerged oil remains in the Kalamazoo River.. “That will determine…along with…looking at the science data we’re receiving…how much work …if any.. needs to be done…going into the summer and fall 2012," says Manshum.. That could mean scaling back the cleanup operation. However, state and federal environmental regulators will have the final say on when the oil spill cleanup will be complete.. In the meantime, Enbridge crews continue to remove oil from wetland areas this winter. And in the Spring, Enbridge crews will resume efforts to remove submerged oil from three different segments of the river.

Statement on Ecuador Court Ruling Against Chevron

Evidence Prevails Over Oil Giant's Intimidation Tactics

San Francisco, CA – Today a court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador has ruled in favor of the residents of Ecuador's Amazon region who have spent the last 18 years seeking damages for crude oil pollution. Chevron inherited the suit when it bought Texaco in 2001, and has denied the allegations of environmental damage.

Amazon Watch and Rainforest Action Network, who have spent years working to help the Ecuadorian people and protect the Amazon, release the following statement in response to today's verdict:

"As of today, Chevron's guilt for extensive oil contamination in the Amazon rainforest is official. It is time Chevron takes responsibility for these environmental and public health damages, which they have fought for the past 18 years.

"Today's ruling in Ecuador against Chevron proves overwhelmingly that the oil giant is responsible for billions of gallons of highly toxic waste sludge deliberately dumped into local streams and rivers, which thousands depend on for drinking, bathing, and fishing.

"Chevron has spent the last 18 years waging unprecedented public relations and lobbying campaigns to avoid cleaning up the environmental and public health catastrophe it left in the Amazon rainforest. Today's guilty verdict sends a loud and clear message: It is time Chevron clean up its disastrous mess in Ecuador.

"Today's case is historic and unprecedented. It is the first time Indigenous people have sued a multinational corporation in the country where the crime was committed and won.

"Today's historic ruling against Chevron is a testament to the strength of the Ecuadorian people who have spent 18 years bringing Chevron to justice while suffering the effects of the company's extensive oil contamination."

According to a survey published in Doane’s Agricultural Report, animal welfare is one of the top megatrends that agriculture faces today. Animal welfare came in at the No. 7 spot.. However, it’s important to remember that animal welfare and animal rights are not the same thing. People who are advocates of animal welfare want to spare animals physical pain and suffering — that’s something that livestock producers generally agree with as good animal husbandry makes both moral and economic sense. On the other hand, people who are animal rights advocates give human attributes to animals and consider all animal agriculture inhumane..

Not all of us are lucky enough to live near or by the beach where we can get the natural tan appearance. However, with the damaging effect of exposure to the sun, science and beauty experts have come up with a way to achieve sun-kissed glow without exposing one’s self to the harmful ultraviolet rays. Excessive sun exposure can cause wrinkles and may speed up aging. Hence, the sunless tanning.

Self-tanning or sunless tanning is an alternative to sunbathing. Self-tanning involves the application of chemicals to the skin to achieve sun tan. It has become popular after scientists and health experts have strengthen the link between exposure from the sunlight or tanning beds and skin cancer. In 1960, the first sunless tanning product by Coppertone was released in the form of a lotion. While self-tanner are commonly sold as lotion or spray that can be directly applied to the skin, there are also tanning pills and bronzers that emerged. Generally, self-tanning or sunless tanning is considered safe provided they are used as directed.

So how does a sunless tanner or self-tanner work? Before we move on to the specifics, it will be helpful to be reminded that self-tanning occurs in the epidermis or the outer layer of the skin. One active ingredient in self-tanning products is the dihydroxyacetone (DHA). The dihydroxyacetone is a colorless three-carbon sugar that, when applied, reacts with the dead skin cells. This reaction will result in a change of color and darkening the skin. As the skin gets a change in its color, you will likewise experience a starchy odor that usually comes during the tanning process. This odor is believed to be an indication of the progress of your sunless tan.

The color change is temporary and may last for only five to seven days. It is only temporary because only the stratum corneum, or the outermost layer of the epidermis, is stained. Eventually, this layer is shed by process of exfoliation especially with the use of exfoliating products or scrubs. Many have raised their eyebrows on the safety of the DHA. Since 1973, the Food and Drug Administration has approved DHA for external or self-tanning use. This is subject to an exception where the FDA has not approved the application of DHA near the eyes, mouth, or nose. It is advised to protect these parts of the body when applying self-tanning products, particularly in spray form also use one of the best self tanner on the market is very important.

Another method of sunless tanning is the use of bronzer. Bronzer, which is normally in the form of powder and moisturizer, stains the skin upon application. Unlike other methods, the stain from bronzer can be easily removed by washing it off with soap and water. For tanning pills, on the other hand, are generally considered as unsafe. They are said to contain canthaxanthin, which is used as color additive and in large amount when used as tanning agent. It turns your skin into an orange or brown color, which has been linked to liver damage, hepatitis, and visual impairment.

Behavioural thermoregulation and the relative roles of convection and radiation in a basking butterfly.
Poikilothermic animals are often reliant on behavioural thermoregulation to elevate core-body temperature above the temperature of their surroundings. Butterflies are able to do this by altering body posture and location while basking, however the specific mechanisms that achieve such regulation vary among species. The role of the wings has been particularly difficult to describe, with uncertainty surrounding whether they are positioned to reduce convective heat loss or to maximise heat gained through radiation. Characterisation of the extent to which these processes affect core-body temperature will provide insights into the way in which a species׳ thermal sensitivity and morphological traits have evolved. We conducted field and laboratory measurements to assess how basking posture affects the core-body temperature of an Australian butterfly, the common brown (Heteronympha merope). We show that, with wings held open, heat lost through convection is reduced while heat gained through radiation is simultaneously maximised. These responses have been incorporated into a biophysical model that accurately predicts the core-body temperature of basking specimens in the field, providing a powerful tool to explore how climate constrains the distribution and abundance of basking butterflies.

Gryglewicz, S.(., Mancini, L., Morellec, E., Schroth, E. and Valta, P. (2021). Understanding Cash Flow Risk Review of Financial Studies, :.. - Affiliated author. - Publication year2021. - JournalReview of Financial Studies. Theory has recently shown that corporate policies should depend on firms' exposure to short- and long-lived cash flow shocks and the correlation between these shocks. We provide granular estimates of these parameters for Compustat firms using a new filter that uses only cash flow data and the theoretical restrictions of a canonical cash flow model. As predicted by theory, we find that the estimated parameters are strongly related to corporate liquidity and financing choices, that firms with a higher estimated correlation between shocks implement riskier policies, and that the sign of this correlation determines the cash flow sensitivity of cash.

NHS Blood and Transplant Youth Campaign. Challenge. Mobas was asked by NHS Blood and Transplant to create a campaign that would specifically target the youth market and focus around college freshers. It needed to encourage sign up within that market and needed to have a fun approach.. Strategy. The real challenge was to create a campaign which appealed to a young market without appearing to be a corporate trying too hard to be ‘cool’. It was important to keep the campaign simple but to be very eye catching as the target market would be being hit with a lot of advertising and promotion from lots of different industries. It also needed to appeal to both males and females from different ethnic backgrounds.. Results. The campaign was rolled out across the country and received great feedback. It continues to stand out in a crowd and encourage donation from the target market.

Steven Spielberg has warned that a future ruled by virtual reality is coming "whether we like it or not".

Presenting his upcoming sci-fi film at this year's Comic-Con in San Diego on Friday, the acclaimed director addressed what has recently been a recurring topic for him.

Virtual reality, or VR, began its expansion in the film industry over the last year, with the Cannes Film Festival presenting its first VR entry this year.

Carne Y Arena (Meat And Sand) by Birdman director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu had its debut at the Croisette in May, opening alongside Spielberg's studio animation The BFG.

At the time, the Schindler's List director warned of the dangers virtual reality could present to the industry.


"I think we're moving into a dangerous medium with virtual reality," he said.

Spielberg goes VR for Ready Player One

"The only reason I say it is dangerous is because it gives the viewer a lot of latitude not to take direction from the storytellers but make their own choices of where to look.

"I just hope it doesn't forget the story when it starts enveloping us in a world that we can see all around us and make our own choices to look at."

Now he seems to have, if not changed his mind, at least embraced the future.

Presenting his new film Ready Player One, Spielberg spoke about the challenges of adapting Ernest Cline's book about a dystopian future where humans take refuge in VR after the world is destroyed by global warming.

In the film, the hero lives in 2044, but spends his time immersed in 1980s pop culture through virtual reality.

"It's the most amazing flash forward and flashback at the same time - to a decade I was very much involved in as well as a future that I think is out there awaiting all of us whether we like it or not," Spielberg said.

Image: Spielberg, Cline and actor Tye Sheridan shared the stage at Comic-Con

The 70-year-old director now sees VR as the opening of new possibilities, where humans are able to do "anything you can possibly imagine".

Directing Ready Player One, Spielberg was faced with 80s nostalgia and pop references related to his own work in the past, and said he feared being "vilified for some kind of grand act of grand larceny of vanity".

For the book's author, having the director taking on his book was a match made in heaven.

"To be honest with you, I thought this would never happen," Ernest Cline said at Comic-Con.

"I never thought we'd be able to make this movie, because we'd need someone like Steven Spielberg to direct it.

"And when they told me they were going to send it to him I was like, 'oh, he's never going to do it'."

Ready Player One premieres 30 March 2018.

Preferring Local Control

It’s two weeks already. Wow. The English thing is rad. Just think if Iowans had the guts to throw off the chains of the Federales. Caramba! But Iowans would rather have the crumbs than freedom and the prosperity that comes with it. Comfy, eh?

Preferring Local Control

Back in the days when socialism was failing in the Soviet Union (The system failed. Ronald Reagan had nothing to do with it.), I had a friend who traveled to Latvia on a farm tour. I remember what he found when he got there.

Imagine a field of oats, just beginning to head out, a stunted pale yellow with cracked soil easily visible through the canopy. The farmer had actually planted the oats in the rain because the call had come from Moscow, five hundred miles away, that it was time. The farmer ignored local conditions to be loyal to the central authority that had promised social justice at any price.

I doubt that any farmer hasn’t longed for the comfort of following orders at a job rather than the risk and responsibility of ownership.

The dairy operation was also an eye opener for the American tourist. No directive ever came for a manure management plan. The manure was pitched out of the barn, apparently so they could walk around in there, and that was it. When there was no room outside the doors and windows to pitch more, an elevator was set up and the manure deposited several feet from the barn until it reached up to the outlet of the elevator. The elevator was swung around in a half circle until the manure reached the top in all possible directions. Then another elevator was brought in.

The oats lacked fertilizer in the the hard baked mud. The farmer never hauled the manure onto the fields and he planted in the worst possible conditions. How could this happen?

The Brexit vote can shed a light on events that led up to the terrible management of that farm.

The most basic unit of government is the individual. Next we are part of a family, then a neighborhood, then a town, and so forth. Each step away from ourselves lessens the importance to us and also the quality of our decisions. It can’t be helped, as illustrated by the failure of the Latvian farmer and his Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

It could be argued that, not only is the European Union too big, but England is too big as well. There is evidence that there are neighborhoods in England where Sharia Law rules above the law of jolly old England. Space limits the description of the difference, but believe me, English Common Law is what we are used to and Sharia is not.

This is a direct result of a government that tries to be inclusive of too many cultures. Scotland and Ireland have become dependent on handouts from Mother England. Their economies have been weakened by the presence of someone else available to pay for careless management so they voted to remain in the union. Greece’s welfare state may have grown to unsustainable proportions with their dependence on the EU. But do the people of the more frugal and productive nations in the union deserve to spend part of each workday stuffing grape leaves for slothful olive farmers?

So far nothing has been written about actual consequences of Brexit, only about the emotional reactions rooted in the uncertainty of the change. But if you lived there would you like the EU (funny how that sounds like something stinks) making regulations to suit an entire continent? You can’t recycle a teabag? A child under eight can’t blow up a balloon? You can’t use better windows in trucks to make cyclists more visible?

Here in the U.S. we had a perfect example of a union of states that could compete and thus improve themselves or face loss of population. There is no federal constitutional authority for the laws that limit that competition today. There is no federal law against murder. If one state wanted a law making abortion legal, and another didn’t, the competition between the morally debased abortion state and the one that valued all its citizens would eventually sort out which society failed and which one flourished. The same would hold true for any number of issues: homosexual marriage, drug prohibition, corporate welfare, and environmental regulation come to mind.

I hope the Brexit vote inspires more governments to downsize and serve their people more efficiently. Our own Civil War was a turning point in American history. At least 600,000 people died to preserve a union that now rewards nonsense over voluntary relations.

We can be thankful to the EU for not resorting to murder to stifle Brexit, like Lincoln did.

I recently made a pair of biracial dolls with natural hair for a beautiful set of siblings from Chicago. It was so fun to make the little costumes for the dolls too. And I really love how the curls framing the little girl's face turned out!

Plastic surgeon Dr. Drew Ordon demonstrates how to rejuvenate marionette lines on the face to restore a youthful look.Read the full transcript »

Reversing Facial Marionette Lines Jim: Here’s a good one. This is on Facebook. This is Erica Thompson writing. She asks when my faces at rest, my lips go down at the corners. Is there a procedure to fix that? And it sounds a question, like a questions for Dr. Ordon there. Dr. Ordon: Now, Jim that such a great question. I get in the office all the time. What would help me is if I had prop out here, a little ahead to show people how would take care of that. Nobody likes that sneer look. You know, number one. What is cause? Well, it’s combination of gravity things falling a little bit and loosing volume in the face. How do I fix it? Well, typically it’s combination of two things. Thank you. Well, that’s what I called good service. So, you know, so called sneer or merry in that line, I see it all the time in the office. It’s when the corner of your mouth is down turn in here, it gives a sneering look to your face. It’s caused by two things; gravity, just gravity pulling down like so and as we age we also loose volume in the face. It’s a combination of gravity and volume. Dr. Shears: But if you keep smiling all the time. Dr. Ordon: Well, it’s a¿this isn’t as much as smiling as crows feet. Dr. Shears: Okay. Dr. Ordon: This is more gravity and volume. So how do we fix it? Well, number one we want to add volume to the corner of the mouth here that so called merry in that line with fillers typically hyaluronic acid and we do a little maneuver where we weave that hyaluronic acid right along the corner of the mouth and that will actually lift that mouth up a little bit. Finally, a little touch of buttocks right here, it will actually bring that lip up. So the solution typically two folds of fillers and some buttocks. Dr. Shears: With some fillers and buttocks. Jim: Which is fairly quick in the office procedure? Dr. Ordon: Yes. Because your face, what really isn’t going to help that spot. The face lift will help erase the wavy line, it will help you in the cheek, the jaw, with the botox stops right here, it’s not going to pull up the corner of the mouth. Dr. Shears: Thank you. Jim: Thank you Dr. Ordon. And Dr. Shears for sharing those great questions with us.

Egbert Coleby Morland

Egbert Coleby Morland  (1874–1955) was an English physician and medical editor.

After education at Whitgift School in Croydon and then at Bootham School in York, Egbert Morland studied at Owens College, Manchester, where he graduated BSc in 1893. By means of a scholarship, he studied medicine at St Bartholomew’s Hospital, where he qualified in 1897 MRCS and graduated in 1898 MB with the gold medal in physiology. He held appointments as house physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital and to the Great Ormond Street Hospital, but he developed pulmonary tuberculosis with haemoptysis. He had to abandon his house appointments and seek treatment in Switzerland. His fiancée Mary Latchmore insisted on marrying him (in 1903) and nursed him back to better health.

Morland decided to stay in Switzerland and to specialise in the treatment of tuberculosis. After education at the Protestant boarding school in Schiers, he studied medicine at Berne under Kocher and Sahli. Morland received the MD (Berne) with thesis Über die klinische Bedeutung der Opsonine in 1907 and, more importantly for his career, the Federal Diploma allowing him to practise medicine in Switzerland.

He practised as a pulmonary specialist in Switzerland for eleven years (1903–1914) first at Davos and then in Arosa, as director of the Villa Gentiana, a sanatorium for English-speaking patients. At Arosa he was a pioneer of the English colony and helped to build the Anglophone church. During the first year of WWI he served in France as part of a relief unit under the Friends War Victims Relief Committee (FWVRC), but in 1915 went to London and joined the editorial staff of The Lancet.

Morland also edited Maternity and Child Welfare: A Monthly Journal for Workers among Mothers and Children from 1917 to 1934. As editor-in-chief of The Lancet from 1937 to 1944, he was preceded by Sir Samuel Squire Sprigge and succeeded by Theodore F. Fox. Morland was elected in 1930 FRCS and in 1941 FRCP.

Morland and his wife, both Quakers, adopted two sons and a daughter. Egbert Morland came from a Quaker family and had four older brothers. One of his older brothers was Harold Morland, an accountant and auditor, who was Clerk of the Society of Friends from 1927 to 1932.

The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when you’re uncool.

In 2012, Wired contributor Mat Honan got hacked and this year Naoki Hiroshima got hacked. Why? In both cases people wanted to own their short Twitter handles. It’s strange to think that something so trivial and ultimately unimportant caused such a problem and in Honan’s case almost caused him to lose precious data that wasn’t backed up. Social engineering played a big part of the problem that led them to getting hacked and while there’s not a lot you can do about that you can at least make things more difficult on would-be hackers with two factor authentication. Two factor authentication requires something else in addition to a password to get access to something. It may be a text message to your device, an additional piece of information about yourself, a PIN that only you know, etc.

Techcrunch tells us of a site called TwoFactorAuth.org that keeps a list of services that offer two factor authentication and gives you an ability to let the sites that you rely on that don’t offer it that they should.

At a bare minimum, you should ensure that your domain registrar, emailprovider, and cloudproviders are all using it. Controlling a person’s email address gives you the ability to reset their passwords on any number of services and you don’t want people to be able to wipe any files / backups or be able to hold them hostage as was the case with Honan.

Follow-up study of British military hostages and their families held in Kuwait during the Gulf War.
On 2 August 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait and held hostage all its inhabitants. Amongst those forced to stay were 71 British servicemen and their families who were held hostage for up to four and a half months. This study investigated the mental health status of this group of individuals at 6 and 18 months after the final hostage was released. Participants completed the Impact of Event Scale and the 28-item version of the General Health Questionnaire at both 6 and 18 months. In addition they completed a questionnaire regarding background factors, the dimensions of the trauma and the effects of their hostage experience. The Impact of Event Scale scores changed little over time whereas the General Health Questionnaire scores reduced significantly (p = .001) over the 12-month period suggesting that despite ongoing intrusive and avoidance phenomena levels of psychological distress did reduce. Those variables most strongly associated with a poor psychological outcome were witnessing physical violence and perceived deterioration in physical and mental health. Poor outcome at 6 months was strongly correlated with poor outcome at 18 months.

Cold rolled drawn slit cutting steel flat bar is a beam with an I-shaped cross-section. The horizontal elements of the "I" are known as flanges, while the vertical element is termed the "web". Cold rolled drawn slit cutting steel flat bar is usually made of structural steel and is used in construction and civil engineering. The cold rolled drawn slit cutting steel flat bar resists shear forces, while the flanges resist most of the bending moment experienced by the beam. Cold rolled drawn slit cutting steel flat bar theory shows that the I-shaped section is a very efficient form for carrying both bending and shears loads in the plane of the web.. 2.

Are you more creative when you're drunk? It's one of those soundbites that you're liable to hear a friend spout off somewhere between their fourth and fifth beer — a little factoid that might actually sound somewhat feasible if only there were a scientific study lying around to back it up.


Fortunately for you, Jonah Lehrer — master of ceremonies over at Frontal Cortex — has served up a recently published study that proves that being drunk can, in fact, be great for creativity. (As an added bonus, he throws in a second paper that shows the same can be said about being sleepy.)

So how do alcohol and grogginess help you wring as much creative juice out of your brain as possible? According to Lehrer, they both help us "consider irrelevant information... eavesdrop on all the stray associations unfolding in the far reaches of the brain. We are more likely to find the answer because we have less control over where we look." He continues:

A brand-new study by scientists at the University of Illinois at Chicago compared performance on insight puzzles between sober and drunk students. (They were aiming for real intoxication, giving students enough booze to achieve a blood alcohol level of 0.075.) Once the students achieved "peak intoxication" the scientists gave them a battery of word problems – they're known as remote associate tests – that are often solved in a moment of insight. Here's a sample problem. Your task is to find the one additional word that goes with the following triad of words: Cracker Union Rabbit In this case, the answer is "jack." According to the data, drunk students solved more of these word problems in less time. They also were much more likely to perceive their solutions as the result of a sudden insight. And the differences were dramatic: The alcohol made subjects nearly 30 percent more likely to find the unexpected solution.

The ARU had been deciding whether to remove either the Melbourne Rebels or Force but, after a two-week arbitration with RugbyWA, the ARU said they had decided to "discontinue the Western Force Super Rugby license".

The Rugby Union Players Association issued a swift response, declaring the ARU's decision as the abandonment of the game's "national footprint".

Editor's Picks

The Australian Rugby Union [ARU] has removed Western Force from Super Rugby, but is adamant Western Australia won't be abandoned by the 15-man game.

"Today's is the darkest day in the history of Australian Rugby with the custodian of the game confirming their desire to end the tenure of the Western Force and abandoning the game's national footprint."

"The future of professional Rugby in Western Australia will now be the collateral damage of the decision making of the ARU and SANZAAR to expand Super Rugby to a convoluted and complicated 18 team structure against various advice and modelling received which explained the associated risks."

"Players, staff and their families at the Western Force have been put under unprecedented and, quite frankly, completely unreasonable duress throughout this ridiculous and destructive process."

Good-natured teasing is a good tool of learning how to find a nice in a group and adjust.. I find myself to be slightly socially retarded, in that I am frequently unable to tell when someone is joking or teasing. I tend to assume people are being serious by default. But I also think I have a good sense of humor; it's just not the same sense as everyone else seems to have. It's like my brain doesn't pick up on some of these subtle cues.. If humor, intelligence, intellect, or sheer largess of being are used to make a point forcefully then it's a case of bullying. Per me.. Joking and enjoying humor in a group is a healthy part of relating. Absolutely. The more, the better and the more adjusted the person.. Teasing respectfully is a sign of intimacy, I always thought.. it's healthy to learn to relate to others with humor.

The provincial government and Nova Scotia's doctors have reached a new contract agreement that the president of Doctors Nova Scotia believes will bolster recruitment and retention.

The contract, which includes an eight per cent raise over four years and moves family doctors and some specialists to the top of their pay scales in Atlantic Canada, was approved by the membership of Doctors Nova Scotia this week and released Wednesday. About 69 per cent of eligible members voted on the deal, which received 95 per cent support.

Dr. Gary Ernest, president of Doctors Nova Scotia, said having doctors at or near the top of pay scales in Atlantic Canada will help keep doctors in the province and bring back those with ties to here who left for greener financial pastures.

"It going to either equalize us or get us close enough to what people are earning in other provinces that it's going to make people say, 'You know, it's close enough or I'm ahead, I'll come to Nova Scotia,'" he said in an interview.

"The spinoff of that is access for the public."

In total, doctors will get $135 million more by the final year of the deal.

Dr. Gary Ernest is president of Doctors Nova Scotia and a family doctor in Liverpool. (CBC)

Beyond the eight per cent increase, there is an additional $42 million for family and emergency doctors, anesthesiologists, psychiatrists and obstetricians and gynecologists.

Although there have been a variety of shortages in Nova Scotia, psychiatry and anesthesia have been a particular problem for this province and the rest of Canada.

The rural retention bonus will double to $16,000 by the end of the contract, something Ernest, a family doctor in Liverpool, said is particularly significant.

"A lot of the rural specialists are holding together services by their fingernails because of difficulties with resources and they really deserve a lot of credit for working long hours, spending a lot of time on call," he said.

Premier Stephen McNeil says getting the contract signed means doctors and the government can now focus on other aspects of the health-care system. (CBC)

Premier Stephen McNeil said the deal is affordable, leaves room to hire more people if recruitment does increase and should make it easier now to deal with other issues, such as maximizing the use of health-care teams.

"This contract [negotiation] was preventing, in my view, for us to have other conversations," he told reporters in Halifax.

That includes how to have doctors who retire early work on a periodic basis in areas that need extra help, or continue to cover long-term care homes even after closing the rest of their practice.

"Those are the kind of innovative conversations we'll start having now with Doctors Nova Scotia," McNeil said.

He said it was clear more needed to be done for certain doctors because of how competitive recrutiment has become. He noted the overall raise to all doctors is generally in keeping with what's being offered to public servants, while allowing for the fact doctors don't have access to government benefits or pensions.

Other incentives in the deal

The deal includes support for succession planning, which would see a new doctor and retiring doctor be allowed to overlap and work together as they make the transition without interrupting service to patients.

There is a promise to reduce the paperwork burden for things such as securing a locum and there will be increased stipends for doctors mentoring medical students in communities. Those programs have been particularly successful in rural communities and Ernest said the stipend, while only $450 a week, is important.

Family doctors have also secured a pilot program for a new blended capitation payment model, a system in which doctors receive a combination of salary and a fee for services. The model is used in New Brunswick with some success.

Getting to this point has not always been smooth, with doctors in some parts of the province refusing to provide certain services in protest of what they viewed as unfair wage disparities with counterparts in other regions of Nova Scotia. Things become particular tense in Cape Breton when the government gave a raise to hospitalists who focus only on inpatient care.

McNeil and Ernest said they hope terms in the contract intended to address that disparity will be enough to get doctors back to providing all services.

Premier steps in

The nearly year-long negotiations seemed to stall several times and McNeil said he ultimately decided to become directly involved, contacting Ernest so he could get a sense of exactly what challenges doctors were facing.

"He has a very good understanding, quite frankly, of his membership and the concerns that were faced by specialists and how we needed to address those," McNeil said. "And there was give and take, and we landed and we arrived at this point."

Ernest said signing the deal is a positive step toward better relations and collaboration between the two sides.

"The tide has turned. Things are more positive now [and] they will become more positive," he said. "There's a lot of work to do yet, but this is the start; this is the start of a new era, if you will."

McNeil seemed to agree.

"My hope is that this puts us back on solid ground," he said. "My hope is that they recognize we have a fiscal responsibility to the entire province. At the same time, we've recognized and listened to some of the challenges they say were in the system and that this deal is fair to them and fair to taxpayers and addresses some of the issues that the system was ailed by."

The contract comes into effect upon signing, which is expected to happen later this week, and is retroactive to April 1, 2019.

About us

We are the Directorate-General of the European Commission in charge of the policy area known as "Migration and Home Affairs". We manage policies that aim at ensuring that all activities necessary and beneficial to the economic, cultural and social growth of the EU may develop in a stable, lawful and secure environment. More specifically, we work to build an open and safer Europe.

Building a common EU migration and asylum policy

We work to develop a balanced and comprehensive EU migration policy, based on solidarity and responsibility, which - in line with the Europe 2020 strategy - will make an important contribution to the Union's economic development and performance in the longer term. Our aim is to create an EU-wide set of rules for legal migration, while taking into account the interconnection between migration and integration. We also aim to address irregular migration and trafficking in human beings. At the same time, we work to set up a Common European Asylum System, based on solidarity and respect for fundamental rights, to ensure effective protection for the people who need it.

External dimension and funding of the EU home affairs policy

In all these areas, we promote dialogue and cooperation with non-EU countries so that we can work in partnership and jointly tackle common challenges. Our external action contributes to the strengthening of the Union's position as a reliable, active and pragmatic global player, while ensuring the effectiveness of our policies.

To cater for EU interests, whether concerning migration management or security, financial instruments must be at the level of the Union's ambitions. Sound and effective management of these instruments is an essential component of the Migration and Home Affairs policy. We also manage EU financing instruments that support concrete actions in the field of home affairs.

Europe for Citizens

Through this programme we aim to contribute to citizens' understanding of the EU, its history and diversity and foster European citizenship and improve conditions for civic and democratic participation at EU level.

The first customers were given the red carpet treatment with receptions, banquets and performances. Some of the first people said they were delighted to travel to Taiwan, many saying they've waited a long time to come. There's also excitement among Taiwanese who are hoping the influx in tourism will provide an economic boost. This travel service worker says the tourists could bring in millions of extra dollars every year. Small but peaceful groups of pro-Tibetans gathered outside the airport but were kept far enough away by Taiwanese security forces. A lot is at stake because the flights are the first signs of warmer relations between the two countries.. Direct flights between Taiwan and China. Comment

Nice find on the vaders. I have one on the way to me from California. I'm looking for the cape closed standing still vader with mini holo vader now. Him and the boba with flames in front and boba mini holo. You can see the misspelled stand on the leia with it still carded but its tough. The easiest way to tell is that the misspelled stand leia is on the datestamp 52441 and earlier, anything later is the correct stand.

I found both Chewie versions. Am I to assume the small link is the first version, and ultimately be the Harder to find version?

What's everyone else finding on this?

The small link version came after the the large link one according to datestamps but then again the bly with yellow armpits was first then on the next datestamp they had white armpits and then on the next datestamp they switched back to yellow from then on.

i actually found the small link version once way back when this wave was first released. since then, i have come across about 20 different chewies from various stores and all have been the large link version. i was under the impression the small link was much more rare.

KHLIERIAT, Meghalaya -- The National Green Tribunal ban on coal mining and transportation of coal in Meghalaya's Jaintia Hills region has resulted in many of those engaged in the activity switching to turmeric farming for their livelihood.

For the past one year, these coal-miners, who previously practised unscientific mining and transportation of coal, have taken to cultivation of famed curcumin-rich Lakadong turmeric varieties at their villages in East Jaintia Hills District.

D Rymbai, a resident, invested in turmeric cultivation in his six-acre barren land at Moolamylliang village.

Rymbai owned a few coal mines at the village and never thought of farming as a viable alternative to coal mining until April last year when the NGT issued the blanket ban.

"After the NGT ban, I was disillusioned as to what to do for my livelihood. We had become so dependent on coal mining prior to the ban," Rymbai said.

Like Rymbai, almost 90 per cent of the residents of the village were totally dependent on money that came from coal.

Rat-hole coal mining took over in the early 90s and in a span of 20 years, one could see holes dug up everywhere in the village land in search of coal and even paddy fields were not spared.

The April 2014 order of the NGT came as a game changer as people started looking for alternative source of income.

District Horticulture officer G Dohling says that the department has come up with a turmeric hub to promote cultivation of the famed Lakadong variety of turmeric.

The hub was built at a cost of Rs 50 lakh, funds from the 13th Finance Commission, and will benefit the local farmers, he said.

Meghalaya produces over 8,000 MT of turmeric in a year and majority of this production is concentrated in Jaintia Hills and Garo Hills region because of the favourable micro-climatic and soil conditions. .

According to horticulture department officials, there are at least 1,000 farmers engaged in turmeric cultivation and the number is likely to increase.

Jaintia Hills region consisting of two districts produces at least three varieties of turmeric - Lakadong, Laskein and Ladaw, each having their separate identity, a senior horticulture officer said.

The Indian Council for Agricultural Research data shows that the curcumin content of Lakadong variety is 6.0-7.5 per cent, about 2 per cent higher than the turmeric available in the market.

There is a very high demand from the pharmaceutical industry for these curcumin-rich turmeric varieties as it can be used in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and dye/food-colouring industries.

At present ITC Ltd is procuring Lakadong turmeric slices for extracting curcumin used for in its pharmaceutical units.

The Kentucky Wildcats took a break from the grind of fall camp to take a trip to the pool.. Clearly inspired by the diving competition in the Olympics, head coach Joker Phillips attempted a back flip at the 0:27 mark. It had decent form, but the judges will knock a few points off due to the poor entry.. The highlight of the video, without a doubt, is offensive guard Steven Duff. The 6'0", 330-pounder shows off his front flip, and adds in a half twist at the 1:25 mark, and then follows it up with another flip before deciding that flipping is overrated and splashes his teammates.. Wildcat players also showed off their technology and ability to multi-task, taking the camera with them on trips down the slide and off of the diving board.. Breaks like this aren't out of the ordinary during fall camp. Georgia head coach Mark Richt has taken his Bulldogs to the pool in the past, and even back-flipped off the high dive last season.. Way to keep things fun, Kentucky.

Is the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation exam more stressful for the surgeon than emergency department trauma care?
Stress affects surgeons both during training and during professional activity. To compare stress levels affecting surgical residents during the simulated initial assessment and management in the Advanced Trauma Life Support practical exam vs initial assessment and management of trauma patients in the emergency room. Eighteen surgical residents were evaluated under basal conditions, during the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation, and during emergency room initial care. Heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, and diastolic arterial pressure were measured. The Student t test was used to test for differences between means, with statistical significance declared when P < .05. Heart rate and systolic arterial pressure were increased at the beginning and at the end of Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation and emergency room initial care. Diastolic arterial pressure was only increased at the end of the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation. Comparing values obtained during the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation with those obtained during emergency room initial care, heart rate and systolic arterial pressure were significantly higher during the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation both at the beginning and end of the test events. However, diastolic arterial pressure was only significantly higher for Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation compared emergency room at the end of the procedures. These results suggest that the simulation in the practical exam portion of the Advanced Trauma Life Support course is more stressful for the resident surgeon than is the actual initial assessment and care of trauma patients in an emergency room.

Eli Reed Blues Trio. In 2004, Eli “Paperboy” Reed stepped in to a basement studio in Boston, Massachussetts with a few friends and and a plan: To record the combination of Downhome Blues, R&B and Soul that they had been experimenting with in rehearsal and at clubs around the city.. Now, 10 years later, things are quite different. Reed has gone on to become a star on the international Soul scene, with three more full-length albums, many singles and hundreds of live shows around the world under his belt. As the 10 year anniversary of “Walkin’ and Talkin” approached, though, Reed began to think more and more about the magic that happened that day in the studio and that it might be time to revisit it.. Now, with Reed, the three of them are reuniting to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of that classic album with a tour and a vinyl-only reissue. This is a once in a lifetime even to see Eli “Paperboy” Reed return to his Raw Blues roots with just his guitar, his voice and his old friends supporting.

As the farm bill writhes in congressional death throes, Reason magazine reports that more than 170,000 deceased farmers received subsidies between 1999 and 2005. The total cost of these post-mortem outlays? More than $1 billion. Though official policy checks off on subsidies for up to two years after a farmer’s death (if the farm is still operational), a substantial portion of the payments were distributed beyond the time limit. The research originated in a July report by the Government Accountability Office (pdf). Then the shrugging commenced. —Michael Rowe

This was one of my favorite recent bird photos. Getting a sharp close photo of any songbird is usually somewhat of an accomplishment, but capturing one doing something “cutesy” can be especially endearing.. White-throated Sparrow. This photo was largely the result of right time, right place. But composition-wise I knew I wanted a bit of negative space on the right side of the frame, so the image would not appear too crammed. I went with an aperture of F/7.1 to pull some of the vegetation into focus as well as ensure decent sharpness throughout the bird’s body.. Advertisements

What do we think of when we think of siblings? We think of similarity, familiarity and a duality of human nature. In this photo series titled Siblings Azaan Shah brings out these qualities in his photos where similarity of subject matter is captured in a compelling way. The photo series Siblings, which is Azaan's long term project, is inspired by the photographer’s gaze to find a similarity in people and things which we see on a daily basis in the streets in Srinagar. The photos in this series have real-life siblings as subjects or people who somehow, through the photographer's vision, end up having quality of real life siblings.. Azaan Shah is a documentary photographer from downtown Srinagar. Azaan’s photos have been featured in a recently released photo book Witness: Kashmir 1986 – 2016 / Nine Photographers edited by filmmaker Sanjay Kak. The photographs in this series have been shot with a mobile camera and what is remarkable about them is the broad range of human emotions that they are able to convey..

Basil Tea: For Those Who Have Heart. The average human heart pumps up to two thousand gallons of blood a day. In the average lifetime, a person’s heart will pump one million barrels of blood. The heart works hard and never stops until death, making it an organ that everyone should take extra care of. Many factors contribute to cardiovascular health such as diet, exercise, and other lifestyle choices. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people are diagnosed with heart failure. Drinking basil tea can provide the nutrients necessary to avoid falling into that statistic.

With accusations of sexual harassment and worse, the most awful thing someone could put in the article was a woman was reprimanded for almost starting a fire in her living quarters and women are not allowed male visitors or overnight guests (which is in line with their culture and laws and was not uncommon for many groups of women in the U.S.up until not so long ago and I'll bet can still be found in some dormitories at colleges).?

I was pretty sure it should be "female flight attendants," not "woman flight attendants." "Woman" used as an adjective or noun adjunct sounds awkward and derogative to me (the easiest example I can think of is "woman driver"). Then I did a little google and fell into an internet grammar wormhole. Apparently "woman" is often allowed in this context in the style books of reputable news sources. I still don't like it.

Yes, but at such (often but not always religious) schools the policy is nearly already gender-symmetric (except AFAIK schools don't tend to bother to prohibit same sex overnight guests).

Also, the policies are rarely enforced, and frequently have more to do with building security (guests must be registered, etc.) than anything else.

And frankly, I don't understand why we allow college dorms housing what are legally adults, to make any requirements a landlord wouldn't be able to make. Especially when schools have residency requirements or off-campus housing isn't a realistic option.

Different country, though they're close to each other. Part of the Saudi Arabian shoreline is in between, though I've seen on older maps that Qatar and UAE apparently once bordered each other.

As for the working conditions, I always suspected that cruise ships were this way (but I really have nothing to corroborate that).

Speaking of the Arabian Peninsula, I have an old Nat'l Geographic globe from the mid-1960s. UAE was then Trucial States. Oman was Muscat and Oman, and the globe depicts it as narrow shading along the coastline, rather than showing actual boundaries (perhaps to differentiate from Oman proper though the globe isn't quite that old). Part of present-day Yemen was "South Arabia" and is similarly shown as existing only along the coastline.

The US has 1 mio immigrants each year, Qatar has 1.7 mio inhabitants. Here's a batshit idea: the US could offer all Qataris US citizenship, the offer limited to one year. That would sort thing out... Oh wait, is that one of those countries where woman can't get on a plane without signed consent from a male relative?

Boycott Qatar? At least spread the message so that people who go to work there know what they're getting themselves into, and know to send their salary out of the country each month to prevent it being seized. It sounds onerous to work there - but just possibly within the bounds of cultural differences - although the CEO of the airline sounds like an utter jerk. Qatar has different laws and different views about sex before marriage compared to Europe, America or most of the rest of the world. If people from Europe go in with their eyes open and take the view that it's a useful training experience and something to do for a year or two to get a line on their CV before moving on to a European or US (or anywhere else in the world) airline with proper working practices and employer relations, for some people it could be a tolerable experience.

That's not meaningful. They get their revenue from sources other than their airlines, and frankly the two dozen white people who do aren't going to have any impact.

Since when is a boycott an effective measure in a global economy? That's been the whole point of globalization- the demobilization of local and culturally specific factors inhibiting trade. Boycotts are the actions of the lazy and the impotent. Not that I have anything against the impotent, we're all largely impotent- but I'm against the delusion that we accomplish anything by specific inaction.

Qatar is the venue for the 2022 Football World Cup which, for those of you who know anything about football, is a big thing. If they want to host one of the biggest sporting events in the World they should expect people to start to look at them closely. I suspect this article will be the first of many. Whether it changes anything... well, I hope so.

Increased CNTF levels in adults with autism spectrum disorders.
Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a neurotrophin which could signal neuronal suffering and at the same time acts as a neuroprotective agent. In the present study we aimed to evaluate CNTF serum levels in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In fact, considering the role of CNTF as a neuronal damage signal and the role of neuroinflammation, excito-inhibitory imbalance and excitotoxicity in the pathogenesis of ASDs, a possible alteration of CNTF in ASDs could be hypothesised. We recruited 23 individuals with ASDs and intellectual disability (ID), 20 ID subjects and 26 typical adults. A complete medical and psychopathological characterisation of the participants was performed. CNTF serum levels were measured with ELISA. CNTF serum levels were significantly higher in the ASD + ID group compared to ID (p < .001) or typically developed subjects (p < .001). CNTF may be considered as a potential biomarker candidate for ASDs in the context of severe ID. Our results support the hypothesis of neurotrophic imbalance in ASDs.

The pan-European fiber operator Interoute added a bit more fiber to its network at its southern frontier this morning. They've added a new route to the rest of Europe from their landing stations in Mazaro del Vallo on the island of Sicily and Bari on the Adriatic Sea.. That's the toe and the heel of the boot for those with a more visual image of Italy, and the new route follows the southern coastline while adding 1,300 route kilometers of fiber. It provides new diversity to those submarine cables that land there rather then go all the way up to Marseilles, supplying three new 100G routes back to the rest of Interoute's European fiber network.. More of Interoute's focus lately has gone toward its cloud services, so it's nice to see a bit of news on the fiber side. They did also make an inorganic move up in the UK with the purchase of Vtesse last year, giving them deeper British reach.. Discuss this Post

1. Field of the Invention
This invention is concerned with improvements in machines for conforming portions of shoe uppers to the shapes of their corresponding lasts.
2. Prior Art
Various proposals have been made to provide automatic or semi-automatic shoe machines for lasting side portions of shoes which require little or no attention by a machine operator apart from presentation of the shoe and removal of the shoe from the machine. It has been proposed to load and unload machines by an automatic shoe presenting and removing device. Some of the proposed machines employ helically ribbed wiping rolls for wiping marginal portions of an upper of a shoe assembly. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,591,878, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, discloses a shoe machine having independently mounted wiping rolls for performing a side lasting operation simultaneously along the opposite side portions of a shoe assembly. The wiping rolls are displaced widthwise of the shoe assembly in accordance with variations of outline shape of the shoe bottom, utilizing template means for controlling the widthwise displacement of the wiping rolls as they operate progressively along the shoe bottom. The U.S. Pat. No. 3,908,216, also assigned to the assignee of the present invention, discloses a shoe machine having lasting rolls which are arranged to simultaneously wipe marginal portions of opposite sides of the upper of a shoe assembly so that the upper and insole become secured together by adhesive applied therebetween. Means for effecting relative movement lengthwise between the lasting rolls and the shoe supporting means causes the rolls to operate progressively along side portions of the shoe assembly. Each of the lasting rolls has a wiping element disposed helically about a circumferential portion of the roll. The lasting rolls are supported by roll-carrying means that extend at least substantially widthwise of the shoe assembly being operated upon. The roll-carrying means are capable of arcuate movement about an axis extending generally lengthwise of the bottom of the shoe assembly. The side lasting rolls of the machine just referred to are of sufficient length to operate upon the marginal portions of the upper without widthwise displacement of the rolls. The specification of U.S. Pat. No. 3,971,089, again also assigned to the assignee of the present invention, describes a machine which is generally similar but which has means for changing the angle included between the axes of the two lasting rolls at the opposite sides of the shoe to suit it to different transverse curvatures of different portions of the shoe bottom.
Various proposals have been made to combine lasting of a shank portion of a shoe assembly with a heel seat lasting operation on the shoe assembly in a single machine which would effect a reduction of manpower as compared with a two-machine system requiring two operators. While some success has been achieved by the use of the combined machines, the machines have had certain limitations as to the extent of the side lasting operations. Some of the proposals have required a considerable amount of adjustment of the lasting arrangement by the machine operator and are not fully automatic machines.
One of the various objects of the present invention is to provide an improved shoe machine having heel seat lasting and side lasting arrangements which are capable of automatically lasting the whole of the side and seat portions of a shoe assembly heelwardly of the portion lasted by a pulling over and toe lasting machine.

Multiple Tornadoes Confirmed Saturday Across the Area, Damage Reported. By: David Shepherd, Director of News & Public Information / Photo Submitted By: Neil Forler. TELL CITY -- The National Weather Service has confirmed multiple tornadoes touched down in the area Saturday.. An EF – 0 hit Main Street in Tell City, damaging roofs and bending an amateur radio tower.. A tree blew onto a garage in town and multiple large trees were downed.. The twister had peak winds between 70 mph – 80 mph and was on the ground for just under two miles before breaking up at the northern end of Quaker Road.. An EF-1 tornado also touched down in Stanley in neighboring Warrick County.. That one packed winds of 110 mph and cut a 2 and a quarter mile path, blowing out a wall of a home and damaging roofs and crops.. An EF 0 tornado was also confirmed in Hancock County, Kentucky.. Luckily, no injuries reported in any of Saturday’s tornadoes.

Q:

From FullyName string to Type object

Anyone know how to get a Type object from a FullName?
Eg. 
string fullName = typeof(string).FullName; 
Type stringType = <INSERT CODE HERE> 
Assert.AreEqual(stringType, typeof(string) 

A:

string fullName = typeof(string).FullName; 
Type stringType = Type.GetType(fullName);

However, note that this only searches the calling assembly and core MS assemblies. It is better to use either the AssemblyQualifiedName, of find the Assembly first, and use Assembly.GetType(fullName).
Either:
string qualifiedName = typeof(string).AssemblyQualifiedName;
Type stringType = Type.GetType(qualifiedName);

or
Assembly a = typeof(SomeOtherTypeInTheSameAssembly).Assembly;
Type type = a.GetType(fullName);

Update re comments; note that AssemblyQualifiedName includes versioning information; this is fine for use in things like configuration files, but if (as is the case here) you are using this for persistance, it is often better to use an implementation independent contract. For example, xml (via XmlSerializer or DataContractSerializer) is not concerned about the specific types, as long as the layout is correct.
If space is an issue, binary formats are often shorter - but BinaryFormatter includes type metadata, and isn't platform independent (try consuming it from java, for example). In such cases, you might want to look at custom serializers such as protobuf-net, which is contract-based, but using Google's "protocol buffers" cross-platform wire format.

Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight released two videos on Friday reaffirming his support for President Donald Trump, who he called "the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln."

Addressing the videos to the "people of the Republican Party," Voight praised Trump's job efforts, which he claims has been difficult, "for [Trump's] battling the left and their absurd words of destruction."

"I'm here today to acknowledge the truth, and I'm here today to tell you, my fellow Americans, that our country is stronger, safer, and with more jobs because our president has made his every move correct," Voight said.



"Don't be fooled by the political left because we are the people of this nation that is witnessing triumph," he continued. "So let us stand with our president, let us stand for this truth that President Trump is the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln. God bless America, and may God continue to guide this nation."

Voight is one of Hollywood's most outspoken conservative voices. He was also one of Trump's earliest Hollywood supporters, who has continued to support the president more than two years into Trump's first term.

During an inauguration event at the Lincoln Monument in Jan. 2017, Voight said that "God answered all our prayers" with Trump's election.

"And President Lincoln, who sits here with us ... I'm sure is smiling knowing America will be saved by an honest and good man who will work for all the people, no matter their creed or color," Voight said, according to The Hill.

Permeable pavement helps water soak into your property!. Choosing the Right Permeable Hardscape. The first step to creating pavement that is permeable is to choose an option that matches the space given for the project and the budget that is being utilized. Some types of pavement include:. - Permeable pavers, which are similar to traditional stone pavers, but have special gaps filled with small stones that allow water to seep into the ground.. - A plastic or concrete grid system, in which the gaps are filled with gravel or grasses for easy infiltration.. - A porous asphalt, porous pavement (local company!) or pervious concrete, which is a lower cost option, that allows water to flow through final example and a lower cost option.. 1 Comment:. By Odette Iskander 08 Aug 2018. I like the idea of permeable pavement a lot. Unfortunately, I currently live in a condo and can’t exercise that option. I will mention to friends who may be paving.

TMZ has obtained a copy of a defamation lawsuit Stern just filed in L.A. County Superior Court. He claims Hatten -- the sister of Anna Nicole Smith's crazy ex-con ex-boyfriend Mark -- fed lies to Cosby, including the one that Stern gave lip service to Larry B ... in a Paris Hilton kind of way. Cosby's already been sued for publishing the allegation ... et tu, Jackie.. And there's more ... Stern is also suing Mark Speer, the dude Debra Opri hired to bodyguard Birkhead. Larry fired Speer, and Stern claims the scorned heavy then made up lies, which he spoon fed to Cosby. The alleged lies include claims that Stern was stealing money from Anna and striking back door deals with Birkhead over Dannielynn.. Stern is suing Hatten and Speer for unspecified damages.. BTW, Mark Hatten was busted for DUI today.

J. J. Thomson and the Existence of the Electron. On April 30, 1897, English physicist Joseph John Thomson gave the first experimental proof of the electron, which had been already theoretically predicted by Johnstone Stoney. Thomson was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the electron and for his work on the conduction of electricity in gases. Joseph John Thomson was born in 1856 in Manchester, England and was taught mainly in private schools at the beginning. In 1876,…Read more

We just released our new forums!. Either option can be correct depending on your particular situation. I think, for the normal citizen, in a self defense situation, a lazer would be a total waste. More than likely what the person would be doing is pulling their weapon, pointing, and shooting as quickly as possible. Now law enforcement or security guards may have a different perspective on the need for a lazer. To me the normal self defense situation is; up close, sudden, pull your weapon, point and shoot. There isn't going to be any time to take a proper stance and use your sights. If you have not maintained situational awareness, you may not even have time to pull your weapon. Your propbably going to be shooting from positions you've never dreamt of. If I thought any different, I would never carry my S&W Bodyguard .380. Hitting anything, with any other than the first shot, at any distance of ten feet or more with that gun is an adventure to say the least.

Courts consider company advisers, such as investment banks, to be "abettors," making them immune to securities-fraud class actions. But in the Enron case, the investment banks still may be vulnerable. Here's why:. 1. The bankers took stakes in off-balance-sheet partnerships they created that helped Enron hide debt. Plaintiffs will try to prove that they are "instigators" of fraud, not just abettors.. 2. Private partnership documents show that banks knew Enron's finances were shaky, but their underwriting filings on debt issues sold to the public suggest otherwise. Plaintiffs will claim the filings were fraudulent.. 3. Document discovery may produce further embarrassing revelations.. Data: Legal documents, BusinessWeek

I used the filter shown below:. Position of active player exactly 9. Raised Preflop any 2Bet. Raised First in. Players dealt into hand between 3 and 10. I wanted to look at bvb results when I was in the SB vs specific opponents in the BB when I raise first in.. When I run this filter I can look at specific opponent stats - vs a certain opponent it says I won 7 hands and lost 90.. However, when I click on that player and look through all the hands I won 80 hands and lost 90. It's way undercounting my stats. It's also showing (in the top box summary) that I won $200 and lost $2,000, but when I look down at individual hands my amount won is way undercounted.. Am I doing something wrong or is it displaying info incorrectly?

Q:

Safe Home Network through WiFi

Maybe this is such an obvious question that it's a duplicate.
I have Ubuntu 10.10 on both my PC and Laptop. The Laptop connects to the Internet through a WiFi router. The PC connects to the same router with an Ethernet cable.
How can I safely share files between my PC and Laptop through this router? Do I have to change the router's config?
I'll need SSL as the WiFi is open at this moment, but I guess I can find info about that without a problem. Once I've done that, network printing should be easy :)
Edit Updated both to 11.10. Activated DHCP on the router to fix the IP addresses of both computers and the router now uses WPA2. I haven't been able to set up NFS between the computers, but I did achieve a safe FTP server connection.

A:

For this you need sftp
Firstly install ssh on all three computers
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
and find the ip of the computer using these commands:
sudo ifconfig | grep -o "inet addr:[0-9.]*" | cut -d ":" -f 2 | grep -v ^127

On the other computers do so in nautilus:

Click connect and bookmark it like this

Similarly do the same for the other machines use the bookmarks to nagivate the other computers

A:

On each computer install the ssh package.
Then you can mount the filesystem over SFTP (stands for Ssh File Transfer Protocol) in nautilus and copy that way just like you would between drives. To access files on the other computer, open nautilus and Clik the File -> Connect to server... menu. Pick ssh from the menu/list. Put in your username for the other computer and the IP for the other computer and click connect. It should ask for your password for the laptop username you put in and then it should show the files on the laptop. (You can do this in either direction.)
This method encrypts the whole thing both ways so it is safe even over open wifi (or if you use strong passwords) even over the internet. 
You can find out the IP of a computer by running ifconfig on it. It will give you something like this:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:11:11:9e:58:57  
          inet addr:192.168.1.15  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

          RX bytes:348505532 (348.5 MB)  TX bytes:127490351 (127.4 MB)

lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
          RX packets:68246 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:68246 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

          RX bytes:35179159 (35.1 MB)  TX bytes:35179159 (35.1 MB) 

Look for a line that says 'inet addr:192.168.###.###' (that does not start with 127.0.) and that is the IP address. So for the example ifconfig output I listed, it would be 192.168.1.15   This would be the address I would use to connect to the computer I ran ifconfig on.

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) -
Home loan rates rose in anticipation that the Federal Reserve will raise rates sooner, and faster, than many market watchers expect, mortgage financier Freddie Mac said Thursday.

"All eyes will be on the Fed for the next few months at least. How aggressive or how measured the coming rate hikes are will determine the future direction of both short- and long-term mortgage rates," said Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist.

For the week ended June 11, the rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 6.30 percent, with an average 0.7 point payable up front, up slightly from the previous week when it averaged 6.28, according to Freddie Mac.

Last year at this time, the 30-year averaged 5.21 percent.

The 15-year mortgage advanced to 5.67 percent from last week's 5.63 percent, with 0.7 point payable up front. A year ago, it was 4.60 percent.

The one-year adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) averaged 4.14 percent, up from 3.98 percent the previous week, with 0.7 point payable up front. A year earlier it averaged 3.54 percent.

"The 1-year ARM responds more directly to movements by the Fed," said Nothaft. "And market chatter has it that the Fed will not only raise rates at the end of this month, but may do so consecutively throughout the rest of the year."

"News like that is good news for keeping long-term fixed-rate mortgage rates low since those are more sensitive to inflationary expectations."

Freddie Mac's average mortgage rates are based on a survey of 125 lenders nationwide.

Freddie Mac (FRE: up $0.55 to $60.32, Research, Estimates), or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., is a publicly traded company the government established in 1970 to provide a flow of funds to mortgage lenders. It buys mortgages from banks, bundles them and then resells them as mortgage-backed securities.

Its products, and the products of other similar entities, have become popular as an alternative to government-backed bonds, notably with international investors.

Biodegradation of methyl violet by Pseudomonas mendocina MCM B-402.
Pseudomonas mendocina MCM B-402 was found to utilize a triphenylmethane dye, methyl violet as the sole source of carbon when incorporated in synthetic medium. Almost complete decolorization of methyl violet by P. mendocina was observed within 48 h of incubation at ambient temperature (28 +/- 2 degrees C) under aerated culture conditions, when the bacteria were inoculated into Davis Mingioli's synthetic medium at a concentration of 100 mg/l medium. Methyl violet was mineralized to CO2 through three unknown intermediate metabolites and phenol. The decolorization of the dye involved demethylation.

3rd Annual Aggie Wallace Bagpipe Competition

For the third time in many years, there will be a bagpipe competition at this year’s Highland Festival and Games. All pipers whatever ages and playing abilities are invited to come and participate. You will enter the competition at the Festival.

The competition is named for Aggie Wallace who is recognized as the first individual who trained and organized Hawaii residents in the art of playing the bagpipe and organized them into the first local bagpipe band. Aggie came to Hawaii in 1938 on the invitation of E.K. Fernandez who immediately put her to work with his traveling carnival. She was born in Canada, the daughter of a Pipe Major, emigrated to Canada with her family and ended up playing on Vaudeville and in Hollywood where she met E.K. and the rest is history.

Pipers will be judged on their abilities as it relates to the playing of marches, strathspays, and reels and the traditional music of the pipes, piobaireachd.

This competition has been made possible because of generous support from the Celtic Pipes and Drums of Hawaii, the Hawaii Scottish Association and from Kim Greeley, who was a student of Aggie Wallace.

Architecture of Johannesburg

Johannesburg is the capital of the Gauteng province and the financial hub of South Africa. Founded in 1886, the city is located in the Witwatersrand region, which has vast gold deposits. The town experienced rapid growth as the gold deposits were exploited, and is now South Africa's largest urban center. As a result, the Johannesburg area has a wide variety of architecture, from early Art Nouveau to Postmodern buildings. Hillbrow, for example, contains many buildings constructed since the 1950s, including the Hillbrow Tower.

Notable buildings
Johannesburg features a variety of commercial and residential buildings, so there are also a few modern buildings such as the KwaDukuza eGoli Hotel and the Trust Bank Building. The Johannesburg-Pretoria combined metropolitan area has the densest concentration of skyscrapers on the continent and one of the densest in the world.

Carlton Centre is a skyscraper and shopping center located in downtown Johannesburg, South Africa. At 223 meters (730 ft), it is the tallest building in Africa and about half the height of the Willis Tower (the former Sears Tower) in Chicago. It was the tallest building in the southern hemisphere when originally completed. The Carlton Centre has 50 floors and is 223m tall, about 40m short of featuring in the world's top 100 skyscrapers. The foundations of the two buildings in the complex are 3.5m in diameter and extend 20m down to the bedrock, 30m below street level. The building houses both offices and shops and has over 46 percent of the floor area below ground level.[1] A viewing deck on the 50th floor offers views of Johannesburg and Pretoria.
Ponte City Apartments is a skyscraper in the Hillbrow neighborhood of Johannesburg, South Africa. It was built in 1975 to a height of 173 m (567.6 ft), making it the tallest residential skyscraper in Africa. The 54-story building is cylindrical, with an open center allowing additional light into the apartments. The center space is known as "the core" and rises above an uneven rock floor. Ponte City was an extremely desirable address for its views over all of Johannesburg and its surroundings. The sign on top of the building is the highest and largest sign in the southern hemisphere. It currently advertises the South African mobile phone company Vodacom.
Marble Towers is a skyscraper in the Central Business District of Johannesburg, South Africa. It was built in 1973 and is 32 stories tall. The building has an eight-story parking garage attached to it. It has the biggest electronic sign in the Southern Hemisphere, measuring 44 meters by 32 meters by 12 meters. It is made out of a mixture of concrete and marble. Its main use is for commercial offices.
KwaDukuza eGoli Hotel is a skyscraper in the Central Business District of Johannesburg, South Africa. The complex, built in 1970 originally as "The Tollman Towers" (owned by the prominent South African family), were two separate towers, one 40 stories and the other 22, linked by a four-story podium with a pool deck and a running track. The building was empty for many years as the hotel, The Johannesburg Sun, relocated to Sandton. The building was then converted to a Holiday Inn, which also quickly failed. The new KwaDukuza eGoli Hotel opened in 2001 when it hosted 3000 police officers for the world summit on sustainable development, it was owned Mark Whitehead of Whitehead Enterprises, then also soon went out of business. The building is currently "mothballed."
Sandton City is a shopping center located in Sandton, Johannesburg that was built as a pioneer center in 1973. The tower was built as part of a business park for downtown Sandton, a suburb of Johannesburg. Liberty Properties announced in 2008 that Sandton City would receive an R1.77 billion upgrade. Liberty Properties Chief Executive Samuel Ogbo envisaged the complex as South Africa's very own Wall Street The redevelopment will include the construction of a 60-story office tower, new retail and office space and residential apartments. The extension will stretch to 30 000 m2 and the total complex will have a gross lettable area of 158 000 m2.
Trust Bank Building is a skyscraper in the Central Business District of Johannesburg, South Africa. It was built in 1970 to a height of 140 meters. The building is the former head office of Trust Bank of South Africa, and as such has one of the largest bank vaults in South Africa. The building was recently sold in February 2003 for Rand 6.4 million (USD $640.000), which may prompt the name to be changed to that of the new tenant.
11 Diagonal Street is a skyscraper in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was built in 1984 to a height of 80 meters. It is designed to look like a diamond as it reflects different views of the Central Business District from each angle of the building.

Speaking to reporters after Kejriwal announced that the Odd-Even scheme will be back from November 4-15, Gadkari said: "I don't think it is necessary. We have made a new Ring Road, and with that Delhi's pollution has come down a lot. And in my estimate in two years...Rs 50,000 crore has been provided by my department, and the Yamuna Clean Water and Clean Air Scheme are going on, and with that in two years Delhi will be pollution-free.". Gadkari said it is up to the Delhi government to implement the scheme.. Kejriwal said that 1,000 electric buses will be introduced in the national capital and that a bus aggregator policy will be announced soon.. "If you enforce Odd-Even for a long time, the implementation becomes troublesome. As of now, Odd-Even will only be restricted to this time frame," said Kejriwal.. He also asserted that Supreme Court guidelines during Diwali on firecrackers will be sternly enforced. Kejriwal also urged the people of Delhi to take part in tree plantation drives.

Follow Follow

"Follow Follow" is a song sung by supporters of Rangers, a football club in Glasgow, Scotland. It is based upon the revivalist hymn "Follow On".

Club usage
The song has been adopted by Rangers as their club anthem. In 2007 Rangers used the song as an inspiration for the title of their initiative against unacceptable behaviour at football matches, Follow With Pride, to replace their Pride Over Prejudice campaign.  There is also a Rangers fanzine named after the song. It is also called Follow Follow and was banned from being sold outside Ibrox Stadium due to having printed articles with a sectarian related content. It moved to an online message board which is now the leading Rangers fansite.

Controversy 
The song has gathered an amount of controversy after some fans started to sing alternative lyrics about the Pope and the Vatican City that are considered sectarian.

In 1999 Rangers' vice-chairman Donald Findlay had to stand down from his position and resign from the club's board after being filmed singing "Follow Follow" (with these alternative lyrics) and "The Sash". The Faculty of Advocates (the professional body to which Findlay belonged) found his actions were "likely to bring the faculty into disrepute" and fined him £3,500.

In 2009, Linda Gillies was investigated by police after West Lothian Council received a complaint after her parrot was heard whistling "Follow Follow", to the chagrin of some of her neighbours. The complaint was eventually dismissed by the council and no charges were brought against Gillies.

Lyrics
The lyrics are:

Though the straits be broad or narrow, follow we will,
Follow we will, follow we will,
If the straits be broad or narrow, follow we will,
We will follow in the footsteps of our team. [God bless them]
Follow follow, we will follow Rangers,
Everywhere, anywhere,
We will follow on,
Dundee, Hamilton, Aberdeen and back again
If they go to Dublin we will follow on.

For there's not a team like the Glasgow Rangers,
No not one, and there never shall be one,
Celtic know all about their troubles,
We will fight till the day is done.
For there's not a team like the Glasgow Rangers,
No not one, and there never shall be one!

I went to my old friend last Tuesday. She and her husband were my really good friends over the years. Her husband was my hubby's best friend. I miss them so much! i really wanted to tell them everything about what's going on to our lives. I love to talk to them and i admire them so much because they have been together for so many years and they never had any major problems with each other. Until i found out that her husband is having an affair. I'm still thinking if i should tell it right away or should i wait?. in transition. 2 years ago. 2 comments:.

Recommendation Reports

Northeast of Fogal Road and The Gore Road – Council had approved, in principle in June 2014, a proposed development consisting of retail buildings, some of which have already been built. The conditions include gaining access to Region of Peel service. They weren’t able to gain permission by November 2015 and got an extension. However, they have made progress and will be gaining access soon, allowing them to build the rest of the development (page 140)

8863 The Gore Road – final approval of a development in principle, as long as the associated case at the Ontario Municipal Board be dismissed. Development includes 113 single detached units, 161 townhouses, a medium/high density residential block, an employment/office building block, and associated infrastructure like open space, parks, and roads. Original proposal was all residential on employment lands, but has now been shifted to half residential (north side), half offices (south side fronting on Queen Street). It should be noted that the residential apartment/condo building and office developments haven’t actually been designed (page 157).

Abstract

Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) is a non-native invasive tree that is of particular concern in the Southeastern United States. It has become naturalized in a variety of habitats and can be found in monospecific stands. The use of tallow woodlands by overwintering birds is poorly documented. I compared use of tallow woodlands to use of bottomland hardwood forests by birds in the Mermentau River Basin, Louisiana. Species richness and evenness were greater in the bottomland hardwood sites. Three species were more abundant in tallow woodlands, six species were more common in bottomland hardwoods, and six species exhibited no difference between habitats. Information-theory methodology was used to determine the relative importance of woodland type and certain landscape variables to species richness and bird abundance. Model-averaged parameter estimates and relative Akaike weights were calculated. In most cases, woodland type was a better predictor of species richness and abundance than percent forest cover, distance to nearest forest patch, or the number of forest patches within 1 km. Energy assimilation of tallow fruit by captive birds was measured to determine if apparent metabolizable energy differed between bird species and plant species. Assimilation of tallow fruit pulp differed significantly between birds. Yellow-rumped Warblers (Dendroica coronata) exhibited the highest assimilation of tallow, followed by American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and then Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis). Yellow-rumped Warblers, which where more common in the tallow woodlands, were able to metabolize tallow fruit more effectively than wax myrtle (Morella cerifera) and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) fruit. Metabolization of wax myrtle and poison ivy fruit did not differ significantly. Cardinals metabolized deciduous holly fruit (Ilex decidua) more efficiently than either hackberry (Celtis laevigata) or tallow. Overall, bottomland hardwoods supported more bird species and exhibited a higher measure of species evenness. Tallow may provide an alternate food source for some species and could potentially influence the local winter distribution of Yellow-rumped Warblers.

Donate. © AFP 2017/ KIM JAE-HWAN. US President Donald Trump has found a way to thrive on tensions with North Korea.. The US president claimed on Tuesday that the US would allow South Korea and Japan to buy more “highly sophisticated” US military equipment in response to the so-called North Korea threat.. I am allowing Japan & South Korea to buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 5 September 2017. Trump did not reveal what kind of equipment he had in mind. However, the White House said the president was willing to approve the sale of “many billions of dollars’ worth of military weapons and equipment” to South Korea.. Trump’s statement followed North Korea’s six nuclar test that took place on Sunday. The US president also claimed that the US was ready to use its “nuclear capabilities” to defend itself and its allies.. Donate

Jill and I continued our tour around Pit 1 and were able to see more of the warriors that were getting excavated and refurbished.. We didn’t hire a guide, since we were in a rush and didn’t want to bargain.. Yes, everything in China is a bargaining event and it gets very tiring.. Sometimes we just want to pay a fair price and be done with it so we just give up and don’t bother.. Imagine living each day as if you were going into a car dealership and having to bargain for a lot of what you want.. It tends to make us cynical and jaded and we, therefore, don’t have as much interaction as we normally would with others.. So, we skipped the tour guide and I wish we hadn’t because I would have liked to know why they are wrapped in cellophane.. Our guess was they were being glued back together and this allows them to hold until the glue settles but we aren’t sure.. Either way, walking around the back of the exhibit was a wonderful way to end our visit to the Terracotta Army.. This slideshow requires JavaScript.

The present invention relates to electrocatalyst compositions. More specifically, the invention relates to electrocatalysts which can be used on the anode of a fuel cell to oxidize alcohol.
A fuel cell is an electrochemical device with an anode and a cathode that converts chemical energy provided by a fuel and an oxidant into electricity. An electrolyte is required which is in contact with both electrodes and which may be alkaline, acidic, solid or liquid. The basic process is highly efficient and essentially pollution-free. Also, since single fuel cells can be assembled in stacks of varying sizes, systems can be designed to produce a wide range of output levels.
As an energy conversion device, the fuel cell is distinguished from a conventional battery by its fuel storage capacity. Unlike a battery which consumes internally stored fuel and needs to be either discarded or recharged after a certain time, fuel is fed to the fuel cell from an external source giving the fuel cell a practically unlimited storage capacity. Also, the fuel cell is distinguished from a battery in that its electrodes are catalytically active.
Current is generated by reaction on the fuel cell electrode surfaces, which are in contact with an electrolyte. The fuel is oxidized at the anode and gives up electrons to an external electrical load. The oxidant accepts electrons and is reduced at the cathode. Ionic current through an electrolyte completes the circuit.
In many fuel cell systems, a hydrogen fuel is produced by converting a hydrocarbon-based fuel such as methane, or an oxygenated hydrocarbon fuel such as methanol, to hydrogen in a process called reforming. This reformate fuel contains, in addition to hydrogen, high levels of carbon dioxide; usually around 25%. The reformate fuel also contains small amounts of impurities, such as carbon monoxide, typically at levels of around 1%.
Other fuel cells, called "direct" or "non-reformed" fuel cells oxidize fuel high in hydrogen content directly, without the hydrogen first being separated by a reforming process. It has been known since the 1950s that lower primary alcohols, particularly the C1-C5 alcohols, can be oxidized directly (i.e., without reformation to H.sub.2 +CO or H.sub.2 +CO.sub.2) at the anode of a fuel cell. Methanol and ethanol are particularly useful.
Because compactness is critical to the commercial viability of utilizing a fuel cell as an energy source in such items as electric automobiles, the ability to oxidize alcohol as a fuel directly without having to also utilize a reformer is important. Serious drawbacks have also been encountered in the storage of hydrogen for use in fuel cells. Thus, a "direct" fuel cell, such as a methanol fuel cell, is advantageous in that it is compact and no energy is used up in reformation. Further, the fuel is easily stored in liquid form, is high in hydrogen content, is highly reactive in a fuel cell, and is economically viable.
In a typical methanol fuel cell, methanol is oxidized to produce electricity, heat, water, and carbon dioxide. The goal in methanol fuel processing is complete methanol oxidation for maximum energy generation shown in the equation: EQU Anode: CH.sub.3 OH+H.sub.2 O.fwdarw.CO.sub.2 +6H.sup.+ +6e.sup.- EQU Cathode: O.sub.2 +4e+4H.sup.+.fwdarw.2H.sub.2 O (1) EQU Net: 2CH.sub.3 OH+3O.sub.2.fwdarw.4H.sub.2 O+CO.sub.2.
In the absence of an electrocatalyst, a typical electrode reaction occurs, if at all, only at very high overpotentials. Thus, the oxidation and reduction reactions require catalysts in order to proceed at useful rates. Catalysts that promote the rates of electrochemical reactions, such as oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation in a fuel cell are often referred to as electrocatalysts. Electrocatalysts are important because the energy efficiency of any cell is determined, in part, by the overpotentials necessary at the cell's anode and cathode.
Platinum (Pt), an expensive metal, is the best catalyst for many electrochemical reactions, including methanol oxidation. A major obstacle in the development of methanol fuel cells is the loss of electrochemical activity of even the best electrocatalyst due to "poisoning" by carbon monoxide (CO). CO is an intermediate in the oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2). The CO molecule is strongly adsorbed on the electroactive surface of the electrode, obstructing the oxidation of new fuel molecules. It is well known that CO, even at levels of 1-10 ppm, is a severe poison to platinum electrocatalysts and significantly reduces fuel cell performance.
Various attempts have been made to find a solution to the CO poisoning problem. For example, Reddy et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,132,193 discloses the use of gold crystals for the oxidation of alcohol. Yepez, U.S. Pat. No. 5,804,325, discloses the use of deliberately occluded hydrogen in the anode to chemisorb the poisons. Various combinations of metals have also been employed as an electrocatalyst material in an attempt to avoid or minimize the CO poisoning problem. For example, Ma et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,836 discloses an electrocatalyst obtained by combining platinum oxides and iron oxides to form Pt/Fe particles in a colloidal solution.
In spite of the foregoing, prior attempts to solve the problem of CO poisoning at the anode of methanol fuel cells have been unsuccessful. Prior attempts to avoid the problem have proven to be too expensive, ineffective, or impractical to be commercially viable. Thus, there remains a need for electrocatalysts that are resistant to CO poisoning and can be used on the anode for alcohol oxidation in fuel cells.

Fremantle Kids & Family Entertainment, a division of FremantleMedia Enterprises, hopes to build upon the success that "Tree Fu Tom" experienced during its first year in the U.K. The highly rated preschool series, which airs on CBeebies and is a co-production with the BBC channel, debuted in mid-April in the U.S. on the Sprout network.

According to Bob Higgins, executive vice president, Fremantle Kids & Family Entertainment, the strategy is to aggressively develop and establish Tree Fu Tom in the marketplace as a true global preschool property. Higgins believes that the series has all of the elements to accomplish this goal, from an incredible story line to high-quality animation to an extensive consumer products program that launched earlier this year in the U.K. and will eventually make its way to the U.S. in the fall.

"We wanted each episode to feel like a mini-movie, which I think we have succeeded in doing," says Higgins. "We have that cinematic feel in a preschool show, and that is what is now clicking with the audience who are so used to watching high-quality movies. Today's kids are very sophisticated, and you do not have to dumb it down."

Fremantle is aggressively selling the preschool educational series internationally with several major deals in more than a dozen countries including France (Lagardere), Australia/New Zealand (Disney), Israel (HopTV), Eastern Europe (Minimax), Korea (EBS), Brunei (RTB) and throughout Latin America (Discovery Kids). The series has already been sold to Italy (Switchover Media), Canada (Knowledge Network/BBC Kids), Norway (NRK), Belgium (VRT-Ketnet) and Finland (YLE).

Tree Fu Tom is unquestionably a cornerstone of FME's Kids & Family Entertainment group, which was formed three years ago when Higgins, along with Sander Schwartz, president of the division, were recruited to establish the company as a global player in kids' entertainment.

FME recently signed a five-year partnership agreement with BBC to develop additional children's TV shows, which is clearly reflective of the Kids & Family Entertainment division's commitment to global expansion.

From the time Fremantle partnered with BBC to co-produce the series two years ago, all of the pieces of the program development and broadcast launch quickly fell into place.

"We brought in new writers, a new design style and we kept the essence of bringing magic into kids' homes and allowing them to participate in the show and the basic idea of this character's adventures going into a fantasy world."

"Tree Fu Tom's" educational, interactive story line, which is targeted to 4- to 6-year-olds, is based on the magical superhero, Tom, and his best friend Twigs, plus a host of other characters and creatures in a fantasy world called Treetopolis. Blue Zoo Animation does the CGI animation.

"The magic–'tree fu'–is kind of like kung fu, with a movement and chant that goes along with it, which is what happens when Tom does his magic," explains Higgins. "We are trying to get kids up off the couch and doing the spells along with him because when the story hits a certain point for Tom to handle alone, he asks the audience for help. It's all about focusing on kids fine motor skills."

"While the skew is for boys, the ratings show it is very close to being a boy/girl thing," says Higgins. "We have a very strong female character, Ariela, and the queen of Treetopolis is a strong female character, as well."

A comprehensive licensing program was developed in the U.K. and is being developed similarly in the U.S. Giochi Preziosi is master toy licensee for the U.K. and Europe; Random House for publishing; Ravensburger for puzzles; MV Sports for scooters and wheeled toys; Flair for arts and crafts; VMC for accessories; Gemma for greeting cards and party; Egmont for annuals; Rainbow Productions for costumes; Blues Clothing for t-shirts; TDP for nightwear/underwear; and Character World is signed on for bedding.

"We have a certain number of things that have strong sales track records," points out Higgins. "At Licensing Expo, there will be a huge push for consumer products, so we are hopeful it will be the same type of timing that it has been in the U.K. We want to build up demand."

The second series of 26 episodes is now in production and will debut later this year, says Higgins, and a holiday special is also being planned.

In addition, Higgins says live entertainment, and perhaps theatrical, is also being evaluated. In the U.K., Fremantle already has a costume Tom character that goes to different stores and retailers.

"Because of the vibrant world Tom goes into, we can create that fantasy land on stage," he says, adding, "In terms of film, that would be a great opportunity."

In the challenging kids' marketplace, the Tree Fu Tom property is gaining momentum and working its magic to emerge as a bona fide global preschool brand.

Use of the ultrasonic cavitation in wool dyeing process: Effect of the dye-bath temperature.
The present work aims to study the effect of the liquid temperature on the performance of ultrasounds (US) in a dyeing process. The approach was both theoretical and experimental. In the theoretical part the simplified model of a single bubble implosion is used to demonstrate that the "maximum implosion pressure" calculated with the well known Rayleigh-Plesset equation for a single bubble can be correlated with the cavitation intensity experimentally measured with an Ultrasonic Energy Meter (by PPB Megasonics). In particular the model was used to study the influence of the fluid temperature on the cavitation intensity. The "relative" theoretical data calculated from the implosion pressure were satisfactorily correlated with the experimental ones and evidence a zone, between 50 and 60°C, were the cavitation intensity is almost constant and still sufficiently high. Hence an experimental part of wool dyeing was carried out both to validate the previous results and to verify the dyeing quality at low temperatures (40-70°C) in presence of US. A prototype dyeing equipment able to treat textile samples with US system of 600W power, was used. The dyeing performances in the presence and absence of US were verified by measuring ΔE (colour variation), Re,% (reflectance percentage), K/S (colour strength) and colour fastness. The US tests performed in the temperature range of 40-70°C were compared with the conventional wool dyeing at 98°C. The obtained results show that a temperature close to 60°C should be chosen as the recommended US dyeing condition, being a compromise between the cavitation intensity and the kinetics which rules the dyestuff diffusion within the fibres.

Q:

Storing dynamic data in NoSQL

I have scenario where I need to store unstructured data but the rest of my data is structured and relational. An example of the type of unstructured data is as explained below:
User Type 1:

How do you blah blah : 5 fields

User Type 2 :

How do you blah blah : 3 fields

User Type 3 :

How do you blah blah : 7 fields

All 3 types are asked the same question "How do you blah blah" but each user type answers it using different number of fields. And there can be a lot of different user types.
For the relational data, I'm using MySQL but i'm a little confused on how to store this unstructured data:

Serialize as JSON and store in MySQL
Use NoSQL

My requirements are high reads, average updates, average inserts & no deletes. No JOINS needed. I need guaranteed writes & high availability. If I were to choose a NoSQL, it'd be a AP type according to the CAP theorem. I won't be hitting millions of records anytime soon. 
I also plan to provide a text search for this data in the future, but it doesn't need to be a real time search, so I can always index the data using Lucene periodically. But of course, document based NoSQL implementations do provide this out of the box. But I have read in a few places where people have advised against storing JSON data in MySQL. But adding a NoSQL layer could be overkill. 
What do I do & if you do advise me to go for NoSQL DB, which one should I choose?

A:

I'll answer your question in an orthodox manner, with a twist of heresy:
Orthodoxy: You shouldn't store data in a column in a relational database that isn't "atomic."
Heresy: In your specific situation, you could -- maybe -- consider this blob of JSON to be an atomic object.
Years ago, Chris Date said it like this:

"A relation is said to be in first normal form (abbreviated 1NF) if and only if it satisfies the condition that it contains scalar values only"
 Date, C.J. An Introduction to Database Systems, 6th edition (Addison-Wesley, 1995)

Later, he took a somewhat softer stance:

"1NF just means each tuple in the relation contains exactly one value, of the appropriate type, for each attribute. Observe in particular that 1NF places no limitations on what those attribute types are allowed to be."
Date, C. J. Database Design and Relational Theory: Normal Forms and All That Jazz (OReilly Media, 2012)

The "exactly one value" I'm arguing for here is "exactly one JSON object" (which could, in turn contain a JSON array).
Storing things in JSON in a column is a bad idea if you need to the DBMS to manipulate it in any way, since, of course, it can't be properly indexed like properly normalized data can be... but, arguably, if you really really really don't intend for the DBMS to do anything with what you're storing other than write and read it, the case could be made to store a chunk of JSON in a single column, claiming the JSON array of values to be a single atomic value.
The big objection, I think, to doing this, is when it's done out of a lack of familiarity with the relational model or out of laziness or naivete.  Obviously, there are a lot of ways it could be done wrong, but I'd suggest that there's nothing inherently wrong about storing a chunk of JSON in a database, As Long As You Know What You're Doing.™
And, of course, you could use a MySQL FULLTEXT index on it, now that those are supported in InnoDB as of (MySQL 5.6).



Shlomo Havlin

Shlomo Havlin (born July 21, 1942) is a Professor in the Department of Physics at Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel. He served as President of the Israel Physical Society (1996–1999), Dean of Faculty of Exact Sciences (1999–2001), Chairman, Department of Physics (1984–1988).

In 2018 he won the Israel Prize for his accomplishments in physics.

Biography

Professor Shlomo Havlin was born in Jerusalem, Israel (then part of The British Mandate of Palestine). He graduated from Bar-Ilan and Tel-Aviv Universities with Highest Distinction. He obtained an academic position at Bar-Ilan University in 1972 where he became a full Professor in Physics at 1984. During 1978–1979 he was a Royal Society Visiting Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, where he worked with Professors William Cochran and Roger Cowley. In 1984 he became the Chair of the Physics Department at Bar-Ilan University until 1988. During 1983–1984 and 1989–1991, Professor Havlin was a Visiting Scientist at NIH where he collaborated much with Drs. George Weiss, Ralph Nossal and other members of NIH. During 1984–1985 and 1991–1992 he was a Visiting Professor at Boston University, where he collaborated with Professor H. Eugene Stanley  and many others. Between  2016 and 2019 Havlin was  a visiting Professor in Tokyo Institute of Technology, where he collaborated with Profs. Misako and Hideki Takayasu.

Centers and research impact
Professor Havlin established four Centers at Bar-Ilan, the Gonda-Goldschmiedt Medical Diagnostic Research Center (1994), the Minerva Center for Mesoscopics, Fractals and Neural Networks (1998), Science Beyond 2000 – Science Education Unit (1996) and Israel Science Foundation National Center for Complex Networks (2003). He was the President of the Israel Physical Society (1996–1999) and the Dean of the Faculty of Exact Sciences at Bar-Ilan University (1999–2001). Professor Havlin had more than 200 graduate students and postdocs, and collaborated with more than 400 scientists around the globe. He published more than 700 articles and 11 books. He was in 2018 one of the two most cited Israel scientists. He is currently in the editorial board of several scientific journals: Fractals, Physica A, New Journal of Physics, Research Letters in Physics and co-editor of Europhysics Letters.

Prizes and awards

Professor Havlin obtained numerous prizes for his outstanding research, including the Landau Prize for Outstanding Research in Physics (1988), the Humboldt Award – Germany (1992), Prize for best scientific paper of 2000, Bar-Ilan University (2000) and Prize for best popular scientific paper Minister of Science, Israel (2002). He also obtained the Nicholson Medal of the American Physical Society (2006), the Chaim Weizmann Prize for Exact Sciences (2009), the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize for outstanding contribution in physics (2010), the Rothschild Prize for Physical and Chemical Sciences (2014), an Honorary Professor, Beihang University, Beijing, China (2016), the Distinguished Scientist Award, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2017), the Order of the Star of Italy, President of Italy (2017) and the Israel Prize for Physics and Chemistry (2018).

Professor Havlin made many important contributions to science. The following are descriptions of his main contributions in randomness and complexity.

Main contributions
Disordered systems that are self-similar on a broad range of length scales are ubiquitous and often modeled by percolation-type models. The laws that describe transport processes or chemical reactions in these systems are significantly different from those in homogeneous systems. The earlier works of Prof. Havlin, where he discovered several of these important anomalies, had an enormous impact on the development of the whole field and are summarized in the monograph “Diffusion and Reactions in Fractals and Disordered Systems” that he wrote together with his former graduate student Daniel ben-Avraham (Cambridge University Press, 2000). The book describes the anomalous physical laws discovered during 1980-2000 in fractals and disordered systems, many of them by Prof. Havlin and his collaborators. His review article (Adv. in Phys. (1987)) was cited more than 1100 times and was chosen by the journal's editors to be published again (Adv. in Phys. (2002)).
In 2000, Professor Shlomo Havlin and his student Reuven Cohen, together with Prof. Daniel ben-Avraham developed a novel percolation-type approach and derived the first theory on the stability of realistic complex networks such as the Internet under random breakdown (Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 4626 (2000)) and intentional attacks (Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 3682 (2001)). This study is particularly useful for optimizing the stability of networks against intentional attacks and viruses. They also derived a novel result about the “small world” nature of complex networks and found that the diameter of scale free networks is significantly smaller and therefore called them “ultrasmall worlds” (Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 58701 (2003)). Since 2010, Havlin and collaborators have focused heavily on interdependent networks. His paper with collaborators developed the percolation theory of network of networks (Nature, 464, 08932 (2010)) and initiated the current active research field of networks of networks. In 2014, he introduced with collaborators  the concept of recovery in percolation theory (Nature Physics,10, 3438 (2014); Nature Comm., 2016).

Going forward, one of the things I am going to be concentrating more on is Detroit’s neighborhoods. The places where the people actually live. I think many of these images may be predictable, but as we go through the city I think many people will be surprised at the diversity and in some instances affluence of Detroit’s great neighborhoods. This post is just a smattering from the East Side, but it is a good example of what I am talking about – clapboard two family dwellings surrounding palatial gated communities and high rise apartments. But was it always like this ? Yep, going back a a hundred years or so. My grandparents raised their family in one of these type of houses, in one of these neighborhoods. My father was born in a lower flat that my grandfather rented from family friends. A couple blocks away were several large mansions, and a gated community..

Everything that comes after , game mechanics , history and synergy between graphics and gameplay holds my attention. So i think you just can't analyze a game by separated aspects since they merge one with the other.[/QUOTE]. This.. What is the first thing you see, when you start playing a game? The graphics, of course. They get your attention and give you a first impression of what to expect. Then it's up to the gameplay to hold your attention and keep you interested.. Overall, both are needed and must be balanced carefully. If either of them are lacking the game as a whole will lose appeal. But as long as the gameplay is fun and understandable, and the graphics are coherent and consistent, then the result will be a reasonably well made game.. Also, other factors like audio, level design, story and that sort of stuff factor in just as much as gameplay and art, but this thread's only asking about those two.

Maritime Ops: Overcoming high freeboard

When making a climb, sometimes all you have is a boat

By Phillip Null

The first and most critical issue to address in any ship boarding or interdiction is how to get a team on board, a planning concern primarily decided by the freeboard of the vessel.

Freeboard is the height between a ship’s deck and its waterline, or the distance from the water to the rail. On small boats it is low and poses no obstacle to a boarding team that only needs to step across from their own boat to board. On larger vessels and commercial ships the height is significantly increased and can only be overcome from the surface by climbing.

Compliant boats will drop a Jacob’s ladder or make similar accommodations for a team to get on, but an unwilling or hostile crew can’t be expected to do the same. There are only a few methods available to make this climb, and though fast roping from helicopters gets boots on deck quicker and in more intimidating fashion, sometimes all you have is a boat.

Use What’s Available
Everyone has seen photo or video of U.S. Navy SEALS climbing chain to board an anchored ship, a tactic that illustrates the first technique teams should consider. If there is already a ladder over the side and it’s tactically prudent, use it. If capable climbers are involved an anchor chain could provide a viable substitute to a hanging ladder, but remember that once on board the team will be at a disadvantage in most cases as they have to maneuver across an open deck from the bow where the anchor deploys to the accommodation and engineering spaces where the vessel’s controls and most of her crew will be. The chain also won’t be available if the ship’s moving, and even if the anchor is set and the ship is stationary, the climb is going to be awkward and slippery.

Climbing Rope
A rope with a grapnel hook tied to its end could be used for some medium freeboard vessels, but by the time climbers make it up they should expect to be fatigued. If carrying a lot of equipment it only gets worse. Knots can alleviate some of the physical strength needed, but safety concerns persist as there is no solid point to clip in if a fall becomes imminent. Ascenders, particularly the kind with power, are available and will make the job easier, but they require additional training and equipment. Their use also limits the number of simultaneous climbers to the number of lines and ascenders available, a factor that could seriously delay embarkation.

Fixed Ladders
The marine boarding ladder, a favorite of Somali pirates, is the best method for medium freeboard heights in the ten feet or less range. Anything higher and they won’t be able to reach. The best of these are fitted with top hooks that slide over a ship’s handrails or kick plates to keep them secure. Teams lift the ladder onto a hook point, test with a pull, then climb up using rungs spaced between the uprights. More narrow pole ladders are also available, and unlike traditional ladders have their rungs leading away from a single pole rather than suspended between two. Many models are collapsible to allow easy transport and storage and some are also buoyant, preventing those nightmare scenarios where the only way onto a target sank after someone dropped it over the side.

Caving Ladder
These are flexible ladders made of two high strength cables with metal rungs spaced between. Used for highest freeboard embarkations, they come at a standard length of 32 feet, but can be custom made to extend even higher. To set them a hook is attached to the top of the ladder then a telescoping (painter’s) pole is used to raise it up to the deck and secure. These can accommodate multiple climbers at one time, but it’s not recommend until the first climber shores up the hook point with a safety runner to prevent the weight and movement from dropping the hook.

Because the painter’s pole must be extended and locked into place and the ladder and hook must be connected, the setup process can cause delays. Several companies have addressed this issue, including ResQmax which offers the VerTmax Pole, an upgrade on the original telescoping design that uses compressed air to raise and lower for faster employment. They also have a line throwing gun that can deploy climbing ropes up to 100 ft and the weight of a ladder up to 50 feet. Another model from Henriksen uses a mechanical winch similar to a fishing reel to speed extension. A top choice for caving ladders and associated equipment is Yates, a popular climbing and weight handling manufacturer with a record for quality and in stock specialty tactical equipment. The last place you need this kind of hardware to fail is miles from land and 30 feet up the side of a ship.

Opposition
Whenever discussing a high freeboard boarding the question comes up of what to do if the opposition starts trying to release or cut the ladder, rope, etc or otherwise impedes the embarkation from their elevated position on deck. Simple answer is that the bad guys are not only trying to prevent the boarding, but at this point trying to kill officers by forcing their fall. Do whatever’s needed to protect yourself and your team. One way to avoid the interference entirely is to choose the hook or embarkation point wisely. Find a spot those on board aren’t covering or won’t expect and climb on quick with solid cover backing the ascent.

Summary
As discussed there are only a handful of options for overcoming high freeboard from the water’s surface. The final decision on which method a team chooses will be based on the target vessel’s construction, the physical ability of the involved officers, and the amount of gear they need to carry on board. Ladders will take a lot of the physical effort out of the equation, but unless they’re a fixed model will require more hardware like a telescoping pole or launcher to get into action. Regardless the method, good luck and hold on tight. Remember the climb is only the first step — someone will be waiting at the top.

Here's a bit of news that might make you drop that chicken nugget midbite.

Just before the start of the long holiday weekend last Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture quietly announced that it was ending a ban on processed chicken imports from China. The kicker: These products can now be sold in the U.S. without a country-of-origin label.

For starters, just four Chinese processing plants will be allowed to export cooked chicken products to the U.S., as first reported by Politico. The plants in question passed USDA inspection in March. Initially, these processors will only be allowed to export chicken products made from birds that were raised in the U.S. and Canada. Because of that, the poultry processors won't be required to have a USDA inspector on site, as The New York Timesnotes, adding:

"And because the poultry will be processed, it will not require country-of-origin labeling. Nor will consumers eating chicken noodle soup from a can or chicken nuggets in a fast-food restaurant know if the chicken came from Chinese processing plants."

That's a pretty disturbing thought for anyone who's followed the slew of stories regarding food safety failures in China in recent years. As we've previously reported on The Salt, this year alone, thousands of dead pigs turned up in the waters of Shanghai, rat meat was passed off as mutton and — perhaps most disconcerting for U.S. consumers — there was an outbreak of the H7N9 bird flu virus among live fowl in fresh meat markets.

What's more, critics fear that the changes could eventually open the floodgates for a whole slew of chicken products from China. As the industry publication World Poultry notes:

"It is thought ... that the government would eventually expand the rules, so that chickens and turkeys bred in China could end up in the American market. Experts suggest that this could be the first step towards allowing China to export its own domestic chickens to the U.S."

The USDA's decision comes with a backdrop of long-running trade disputes over meat between the U.S. and China. In a nutshell: China banned U.S. beef exports in 2003 after a case of mad cow disease turned up in a Washington state cow. Then, when the bird flu virus broke out widely among Asian bird flocks in 2004, the U.S. blocked imports of Chinese poultry. China challenged that decision in front of the World Trade Organization, which ruled in China's favor in 2010.

And, chicken lovers, brace yourselves: There's more. A report suggests chicken inspections here in the U.S. might be poised to take a turn for the worse. The Government Accountability Office said this week it has serious "questions about the validity" of the new procedures for inspecting poultry across the country.

Basically, these changes would replace many USDA inspectors on chicken processing lines with employees from the poultry companies themselves. The USDA has been piloting the new procedures, which will save money and significantly speed up processing lines, in 29 chicken plants. As The Washington Postreports, the plan is to roll out the new procedures eventually to "most of the country's 239 chicken and 96 turkey plants."

The problem? According to the GAO, the USDA did a poor job of evaluating the effectiveness of the pilot programs it has in place.

As a result, the report concludes, it's hard to justify the USDA's conclusions that the new procedures will do a better job than current approaches at cutting down on the number of dangerous bacteria like salmonella that pop up on the birds that will later end up on our dinner tables.

Still, the USDA maintains that the changes will, in fact, boost food safety. In a commentary published on Food Safety News, USDA food safety and inspections administrator Alfred Almanza writes, "If finalized and implemented broadly, this new inspection system would enable [USDA inspectors] to better fulfill our food safety mission. Nothing in the GAO's report contradicts this basic fact."

Challenges to developing countries after joining WTO: risk assessment of chemicals in food.
FAO/WHO encourages member countries to develop national food control measures based on risk assessment in order to assure proper protection level to consumers and facilitate fair trade. This is particularly important for developing countries as WTO members because it is clearly stated in the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) Agreement that: (a) SPS measures should be based on risk assessment techniques developed by relevant international organizations; and (b) Codex standards which is based on risk assessment are regarded as the international norm in trade dispute settlement. When conducting risk assessment on food chemicals (including additives and contaminants) in developing countries, in most cases it is not necessary to conduct their own hazard characterization because the ADIs or PTWIs of food chemicals developed by international expert groups (e.g. JECFA) are universally applicable and also developing countries do not have the resources to repeat those expensive toxicological studies. On the other hand, it is necessary to conduct exposure assessment in developing countries because exposure to food chemicals varies from country to country. This is not only crucial in setting national standards, but also very important for developing countries to participate in the process of developing Codex standards. In addition to food standard development, risk assessment is also useful in setting up priorities in imported food inspection and evaluating the success of various food safety control measures.

BT believes this is the year it claims British sport

Marc Watson chats Premier League, 4K and British tech

2013 is the year that BT goes all in. Come August it will go head to head with Sky by launching its own rival sports service, BT Sport, offering 38 exclusive live football matches from the Barclays Premier League and a tonne of other sports available across its two channels. It's a market that has long been dominated by Sky, but BT has its own unique kicker - the service is free for its Broadband customers.

And despite both Setanta's and (before it was bought by BT) ESPN's previous failed attempts to break Sky's stronghold, there's an air of confidence about Marc Watson, chief executive of TV at BT Retail. "We're feeling very optimistic," he tells us. "We think there's a really big opportunity to expand the market."

He even bats away suggestions that Sky's retaliations, including offering its first free-to-air live Premiership League match on the first day of the season, are a cause for concern. "We think it's a really good endorsement of the model we've developed and we think it's a positive," he says.

"I think it's great. I think they should do more free actually. I think it's a model the customers like and we'd encourage them to roll that model out across more of their products."

BT's plan is to bring in the masses by waving the "free" banner although you'll need to be an existing BT Broadband customer to enjoy the service charge-free (and pay £3 a month for HD if you sign up after August 1). Those with Sky broadband, meanwhile, can get BT Sport for £15 a month in HD or £12 a month for standard, with a one-off activation fee of £15.

"What I'm hoping it will do is bring more customers into the market who want to watch this sport. Sky is doing one day for free. If [customers] want to watch this kind of sport going forward then there's only one company that's free all the time and that's us," says Watson.

"Only one in five households in the UK take premium sports at the moment," he adds. "And that's not because only one in five households are interested in sports, but because only one in five households can afford the premium sport that's been out there so far."

Vantage point

It's been by standing on the sidelines that BT has been able to plot its attack on the market, and now it's ready to strike. But the proof will be in the BT pudding. Although it's keeping cagey on the numbers right now, Watson is able to tell us that they're "very pleased with the progress so far" in terms of uptake for the service.

Still, Watson agrees that it remains a challenging market. "And the regulation of the UK market is very unbalanced," he adds. But BT's vision is long term, and goes well beyond the two channels it will be offering from August.

"The main difference is that [ESPN and Setanta] only had one product to sell which was the channel," he says. "We're a big business with a bulk of products to sell to customers. And the reason we're interested in sport is because we think it can help us sell our range of products to customers."

Watson is confident that BT has the upper hand

BT believes that it can use its sports service to demonstrate the power of its superfast broadband. "There's a lot of money - £3 billion almost - rolling out for superfast broadband around the UK," says Watson.

"The fastest superfast broadband anywhere in the world. That's a network that's primed and ready to go. And one of the things we can use sport for is to showcase that network. We'll be looking at features and ideas and innovations that help us to do that."

TV StandsStands & Brackets

There is something special about good music, and for some people hearing it at home on a good audio system is a relaxing pastime. The typical midi all-in-one system delivers well in a dorm room or a bedroom, but struggles to fill a good sized living room. This is where a decent separates audio system comes into its own.

Why a Hi-Fi Separates System?
A Separates Hi-Fi system typically has signal sources (CD player, tuner, Ipod interface) as separate devices. This goes into the preamplifier, which allows source selection and volume, balance and tone controls if necessary, then into a separate power amplifier. Alternatively, an integrated amplifier containing preamplifier and power amplifier in one box can be used for more modest systems.

Since the components are standalone units, this offers the opportunity to mix and match units from different manufacturers. This has the advantage of flexibility - a company that makes great CD players, for instance, may not make the best power amplifiers. It allows the buyer to spend money on just the components they will use - no need to get a radio tuner if it will never be used.

Hawai'i Pineapple Co. operates a farm on the Big Island, but most of its production comes from a partnership with Aloun Farm, in Kunia.

1993: Dole tears down its pineapple water tower after closing the cannery in '92.

1983: Del Monte ceases Hawai'i pineapple canning operations.

1968: Canning on Lana'i. Pineapple production starting to slow.

Pineapple farming in Hawai'i declined sharply in the past few years at the hands of two agribusiness industry giants, but increasing numbers of small farmers see sweet opportunity in the crop long associated with the Isles.

"Call us crazy, but let's hope we're crazy like a fox — not crazy crazy," said Craig Bowden, a farm industry veteran who partnered to start two local pineapple farm ventures three years ago and has rapidly expanded.

Bowden was one of 42 pineapple growers in the state in 2007, up from 34 in 2002 and 27 in 1997, according to the three most recent farm census reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The rise in pineapple farming involves mostly small farms, so the crop isn't about to reclaim its crown as king of Hawai'i agriculture — a title lost in 2006 to seed crops.

But the niche growth for pineapple is helping maintain agriculture's roots in Hawai'i and counters a perception for some that pineapple farming is dying out in the state.

"It's part of Hawai'i," said Mark Hudson, statistician for the state Department of Agriculture.

Plantation-scale pineapple farming in Hawai'i has suffered over several decades from competition largely from Central America and Asia where land and labor costs are cheaper. Hawai'i's pineapple production by acreage actually peaked in 1955, though the value of annual pineapple sales topped out in 1991 at $108 million.

CUTBACKS SEEN

The most recent pullbacks involved Del Monte Fresh Produce leaving the local market in 2006, and a cutback last year by Maui Land & Pineapple Co. from roughly 2,000 acres to 1,000 acres. Dole Food Co. reduced its local pineapple business in 2006 from 3,100 acres to 2,700, and remains the biggest grower in the state.

Matthew Loke, agriculture development division administrator with the state Department of Agriculture, said Hawai'i farms still supply 100 percent of pineapple for local consumption, but the changes by big producers have created opportunity for more small farmers, especially organic producers and growers of special varieties.

New growth in local pineapple farming has mostly involved very small farms, according to census figures. On the Big Island, 19 pineapple farms averaged one acre in size. On Kaua'i, 16 acres of pineapple were spread over 13 farms.

Those in the industry suspect that some of the small farms counted in the census don't produce fresh fruit for commercial sale, or may only sell at farmers markets.

Bowden is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, among the new crop of Hawai'i pineapple farmers. A graduate of Kalani High School and former manager with Del Monte who worked in the Philippines, Hawai'i and Florida, Bowden partnered with fellow Kalani alumnus and crop research specialist Tom Menezes to start Hawai'i Pineapple Co. LLC in 2006 and produce fruit under a brand named Hawaiian Crown.

The company started with a few acres of its own pineapple variety sold in Times Super Market, and has since dramatically expanded by tens of acres and added more retail outlets including Foodland Super Market, KTA Super Stores and military commissaries.

GROWTH ON BIG ISLAND

Hawai'i Pineapple Co. operates a farm on the Big Island, but most of its production comes from a partnership with large diversified crop grower Aloun Farm in Kunia on O'ahu.

Bowden said 99 percent of Hawaiian Crown pineapple is sold locally in stores typically for $1.59 to $1.79 a pound, with a few exports to places such as California, Las Vegas and even Dubai.

Bowden said plans are in the works to partner with two more existing farms on O'ahu and the Big Island that would double the size of the business.

On a smaller scale, Sweet Spirit Farms on the Big Island incorporated pineapple farming with a Kona coffee farm started in 2004 by Deb and Paul Sims after they moved to Hawai'i from the Mainland in 2003.

Deb Sims said they started planting crowns from white pineapple they bought to eat, and two years ago had accumulated enough plants to begin selling regularly at the local farmers market where the fruit typically sells for $3 a pound.

"They're easy to grow," she said. "They don't need a lot of care."

Sweet Spirit, which has about 3,600 coffee trees, has about 250 pineapple plants on one-fourth an acre, and Sims said she and her husband intend to plant more. "The supply I don't think meets the demand," she said.

Other small pineapple farmers include Phil Green, who grows organic pineapples on Kaua'i at Kaua'i Organic Farms, and James Bunten and Sharon Umbaugh of Bunten Farms who grow white pineapples on the Big Island.

The growth among small pineapple farmers, however, doesn't mean the business is easy or a sure thing. Small farmers have left the business in recent years, a reminder that farming is inherently tough with its exposure to inclement weather, pests and other factors that are hard to control.

PERSONAL PRODUCTION

On Lana'i — once the world's largest pineapple plantation operated by Dole Food — only one commercial farmer is believed to be growing pineapple, but the plants aren't for commercial production.

Alberta De Jetley farms 18 acres planted in a variety of crops, including lettuce and bananas, sold to the island's two resorts and other local businesses. De Jetley said she first planted pineapple for fun about 18 months ago with about 20 plants, and has since more than doubled plantings of crowns she receives from a hotel bakery.

Still, De Jetley, who once contemplated asking Dole for propagation material for 200 plants, intends to keep her pineapple harvests small for sharing with friends and making what she said is a fantastic fruit salad.

She is stepping up to the plate.

Credit: Instagram / @chrissyteigen; @maroney_mckayla

Chrissy Teigen is one celebrity, mother, model, and television personality who loves to speak her mind. If she has something she wants to say, she’ll say it. And apparently, she wants others to do the same.

Chrissy, along with a host of other celebrities including actress Kristen Bell, have recently declared that they are willing to pay McKayla Maroney’s $100,000 fine if she speaks up against alleged abused Larry Nassar in court.

McKayla said back in October that Larry Nassar sexually abused her for years. It all started when she was just 13 years old! Nassar faces similar accusations from dozens of athletes, including by U.S. gymnasts Gabby Douglas, Maggie Nichols, Simone Biles and Aly Raisman.

Here’s the problem though: McKayla reached a settlement over her claims and faces a $100,000 fine if she speaks at Larry Nassar’s hearing. One hundred twenty-five women and girls have filed civil lawsuits against Nassar. That’s why Chrissy and other female celebrities are stepping up to the plate and offering to help McKayla, although it might not be that easy. It also might not be something that McKayla wants. Here’s why.

Ask Our Leaders What They Will Do For Children In Care!

Some of our most vulnerable children are in care today, their voice often drowned out by other competing interests inside the system, so a recent call backed by children’s charities and support groups on our government leaders to pledge their support for these children during the Leaders’ Debate broadcast on 2nd April is a great idea.

You can read the Open Letter to our senior politicians here, which calls on the country’s leaders to tell the nation on 2nd April what they will do for children in care. Sadly, if pledges are made during the broadcast there is no way of enforcing them, but at least our politicians will be aware of what is important to the public moving forward. And we will all be watching them.

News. Nelsonville Bypass Getting New Barriers. By: Athens Messenger staff reports. Posted on:. Motorists driving the Nelsonville bypass might wonder why there are orange construction barrels lining the new highway on its western end.. A contractor will be installing cable barrier in the median of the highway, according to Alan Craig of the Ohio Department of Transportation's District 10 office.. Nationwide Construction Group, based in Michigan, has been awarded a nearly $1.54 million contract for the work, which will include the entire bypass and is scheduled to be completed this fall, Craig said.. The barrier — basically a guardrail made with cable rather than metal beams — is intended to prevent vehicles from crossing the median and hitting oncoming traffic, Craig said..

Rather that restrict traffic for the full length of the bypass at one time, it was decided to do the project in stages, Craig said.

Astronomical Society of South Australia

The Astronomical Society of South Australia (ASSA) was founded in 1892 and is the oldest society of its kind in Australia. It is the only representative body for amateur astronomy in the state of South Australia.
It holds regular general monthly meetings, frequent meetings for members of specialised groups and has available two observatories, one with a 300mm telescope at The Heights School within easy reach of Adelaide and used primarily for public viewing, and a second at Stockport with 500mm and 450mm telescopes presently in service and a larger 36-inch instrument currently being considered.

Membership
The ASSA has approximately 500 members. People of all ages are able to join.

Observatories and facilities
The ASSA has a choice of facilities available to members and guests:
Stockport Observatory - this was badly damaged  in a severe storm in 2010, but in late 2013 the Astronomical Society of South Australia was given $50,000 by the State Government to pay for half of the cost of a new dome. The observatory is used as a teaching tool, hosting groups of curious students and members the public, but it also has an impressive research record.

The question may sound strange but lately, reading immigration news, I started to wonder whether immigrating to Canada through the Quebec process was still worth it.

Indeed, prospective immigrants to Canada who are planning to settle in Quebec must go through “the Quebec process”, since the province selects immigrants to achieve certain objectives. Meanwhile, the federal government of Canada is still responsible for admitting immigrants.

So if you are planning to settle in Quebec, you must go through two distinct processes:

First, being selected by the provin­cial gov­ern­ment of Que­bec and obtain a Certificat de Sélection du Québec (CSQ). At this stage, your edu­ca­tional and work back­grounds are assessed, as well as your abil­ity to inte­grate into Que­bec.

Second, being accepted by the fed­eral gov­ern­ment of Canada. Per­ma­nent res­i­dence can be granted after a medical exam and a background check.

Those planning to settle in Quebec have long known that the additional step, obtaining a CSQ,incurred extra fees. For the principal applicant, it was CA$406 (before April 1, 2012) and for the spouse and each dependent child, it was CA$156. And each member of the family, including kids, needs a CSQ.

Yet prospective immigrants didn’t mind the extra cost and hassle for a lot of reasons:

Quebec has long favoured francophone immigrants and immigrating through the Quebec process was said to be easier than going through the federal process.

A lot of French speakers do want to settle in Quebec for linguistic or cultural reasons.

The province of Quebec heavily advertises immigrating to “la belle province” through a network of Bureaux d’Immigration du Québec (BIC) around the world that offers free information sessions.

The proof of funds required for Quebec-selected applicants is much lower than the proof of funds required for those immigrating to other provinces ($2,889 for one adult arriving in Quebec versus $11,115 for an adult settling anywhere else in Canada).

The immigration process through Quebec was said to be faster for qualified French speakers.

But lately, the Ministry of Immigration and Cultural Communities responsible for immigration matters in Quebec made a number of dramatic changes to the process.

First, on April 1, 2012, the fees levied by the Gouvernement du Québec for processing an immigration application were raised from $406 to $750—ouch! And don’t forget that the Quebec process is only half of the process, you still have the pay the permanent residence fees to the Government of Canada.

Second, to obtain the CSQ, even native French speakers (for instance, French citizens) must now take a French language test. The fees depend on where you take the test, but seem to be around €100 in France.

Third, Quebec is facing a heavy backlog of applications and obtaining a CSQ takes longer and longer. For instance, the Quebec visa office in Paris is currently processing applications it received in September 2011. For Northern Africa immigrants, processing times are much much longer: the Quebec visa office in Algeria is currently processing application received in… July 2008! You can see the processing times here for other visa offices around the world. And don’t forget that this is just one step of the process: the federal government then have to process your application!

So going through the Quebec process is now more expensive, with more hassle, and takes longer than ever—hence my initial question, “is it still worth it?”

I’m not arguing whether settling in Quebec is a good idea. I understand the province has a strong appeal for a lot of French speakers, and if you do plan to live in Quebec, you don’t have the choice, you must go through the Quebec immigration process.

But if you are hesitating between living in Quebec and living in other provinces, I’d urge you to see whether going through the federal process would be easier, faster and cheaper.

Sensitive, high-resolution observations of Galactic neutral hydrogen (HI) reveal an intricate network of slender linear features. Across the high Galactic latitude sky, this HI is aligned with the magnetic field as traced by both starlight polarization and Planck 353 GHz polarized dust emission. The structure of the neutral interstellar medium is more tightly coupled to the magnetic field than previously known. At high Galactic latitudes, where the Planck data are noise-dominated, the HI data provide an independent constraint on the plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation, and hence the local dust polarization angle. The HI data thus provide a new tool for measuring foregrounds to polarized CMB experiments. I will discuss ongoing work using HI morphology to better constrain the polarized foreground, and to better understand the nature of the magnetized ISM.. Magnetic Fields in the Interstellar Medium.

“This is not only an opportunity to invest in infrastructure and lay down the framework for what will be millions of square feet and dozens of buildings, said managing director for Goldman Sachs UIG Margaret Anadu, “but do so in a way that’s really going to benefit Baltimore residents.”

The $660 million tax increment funding (TIF) that Sagamore received last year from the city is cited as a key factor in the UIG’s decision to invest. Anadu said the TIF signified the project was supported by the city and displayed strong public-private partnerships

“With the approval of the TIF, that said the city and state were behind this,” she said. “Then you have Sagamore as the quarterback—they are relentless."

⇓ Article continues below ⇓

A key factor in the collaboration between the private and public sectors was the Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) signed last year between Sagamore, the city, and SB7—an organization that represents the South Baltimore communities of Brooklyn, Cherry Hill, Curtis Bay, Lakeland, Mt. Winans, Westport, and Port Covington. The agreement ensures that the communities in South Baltimore continue to thrive culturally, economically, educationally, and socially during the 20-year redevelopment process of Port Covington.

The $233 million investment will uphold the promise made in the CBA to invest in infrastructure—roads, utilities, and parks for the community—during all phases of the project. Goldman Sachs said they wouldn’t play a huge role in the planning process beyond the monetary impact.

“We will have a voice in the direction of the project,” Anadu said. “But we will primarily serve as investors, leaving day to day on-the-ground execution to the Sagamore team."

Plank Industries CEO, Tom Geddes, said the project would bring thousands of new jobs to the city, nearly 1.5 million square feet of office and retail space, a 200-room hotel, and apartments.

Of the 235 acres, a portion will remain untouched during the redevelopment, and that includes Under Armour’s 50-acre headquarters, as well as City Garage, Nick’s Fish House, Sagamore Spirit Distillery, and the newly opened Rye Street Tavern.

“You won’t see a lot of activity on the site over the next 12-18 months,” Geddes says. “But there will be a tremendous amount of behind-the-scenes work on planning and design going on getting the site shovel ready.”

The prospects of this new investment have Mayor Catherine Pugh optimistic about the new partnership and what it means for the city’s residents.

“This investment, especially from such a prominent partner as Goldman Sachs, means more jobs, more opportunity and more economic growth for Baltimore City,” she said in a statement. “Investors are seeing what we already know about Baltimore—we’re a city on the rise, and an economic hub with a strong, diverse workforce.”

This move comes as Sagamore is in the process of drafting a proposal to Amazon to move a second headquarters to the Port Covington development. Last week, the online retail giant released a statement requesting bids for the new location by October 19. If selected, it would bring 50,000 new jobs and a $5 billion investment in office space to Baltimore.

“We think Port Covington would be a phenomenal location for Amazon,” Geddes said. “Having the vote of confidence of an institution like Goldman Sachs is nothing but helpful.”

Geddes is hopeful that the new partnership represents progress for Port Covington and delivers on the commitment made to bring outside investments to the city.

“We could not be happier that we have Goldman Sachs as our partner,” Geddes said. “It was important to us to find an equity partner that shared our common vision for urban economic growth, job creation, and local workforce development here in Baltimore City.”

Fourteen normal subjects (18-42 y) were studied using venous occlusion plethysmography to investigate the characteristics and reproducibility of the forearm vasoconstrictor response following a prolonged venous occlusion stimulus. Upon release of the stimulus, a transient vasodilation is followed by a vasoconstriction. As the stimulus of venous occlusion pressure increased (40, 60, 80, and 100 mmHg for 5 min), there was a significant increase in maximum flow (p = 0.01). Minimum relative flow (minimum divided by control) was unchanged except at the highest occlusion pressure (0.49 +/- 0.05, 0.38 +/- 0.04, 0.47 +/- 0.07, 0.66 +/- 0.12, p = 0.04). As venous occlusion duration increased (3, 4, 5, and 6 min at 80 mmHg), there was no significant change in minimum relative flow (p = 0.73). With increasing ambient temperature (18, 23, and 28 degrees C), there were no significant changes in maximum or minimum relative flows (p = 0.40 and 0.25, respectively). Minimum relative flow was not significantly altered following occlusion with a 2.5-cm cuff vs. a 10-cm cuff (p = 0.77). Thus, the vasoconstriction response was reproducible over a range of venous occlusion stimuli and experimental conditions. We conclude that dynamic vascular responsiveness to prolonged venous occlusion can be measured by venous plethysmography and that calculation of the minimum flow relative to control flow is an appropriate and reproducible index of the vasoconstrictor response. Based on our studies and to conveniently measure these changes, we recommend a 10-cm venous occlusion cuff, with a pressure < or = 80 mmHg, for durations < or = 5 min, in an ambient temperature of 23 degrees C.

Transonic’s ELSA Monitor Featured on PerfWeb. VV ECMO, or veno-venous ECMO, primarily supports lung function. VV ECMO support can be obtained several ways. Commonly, a double lumen cannula is placed in the right internal jugular vien (right IJ people will know) or two cannulas are used, one residing in the right IJ and another in a femoral vein. The patient’s condition and age will depend on which option is used.. Recirculation is a known complication of VV ECMO that is oftentimes poorly understood and poorly addressed. To reduce this complication, the ECMO team needs an objective measurement for the optimal placement of dual-site cannulation or single dual-lumen cannulation. That’s where Transonic’s ELSA monitor comes in.. The ELSA monitor was recently featured on PerfWeb. Learn more about the monitor and how the PerfWeb panel uses it in this episode.

[Why is it so difficult to legislate on alcohol in Spain?].
Wine belongs to the Mediterranean culture. Drinking alcohol is part of our social life, and its negative consequences have often been minimised, blame being apportioned rather to the individual, who doesn't know how to drink, than to the agent causing the harm. In recent years, road accidents and binge-drinking among young people have put alcohol on the political agenda. Adolescents and young adults have increased their consumption, and a pattern of binge-drinking has developed based on the open-air 'fiesta' nightlife, where groups of young people drink large bottles in the streets and squares (botellón). Educational campaigns and material have been mounted and produced, but two consecutive draft laws on measures for the prevention of alcohol-related harm have failed to be approved, coming up on both occasions against the same vested interests. This editorial reviews the ambivalence of society towards regulations on alcohol and the current state of the art. The first draft law (2002) was about preventing alcohol problems in the general population; the second (2006) was limited to the question of prevention among minors. Nobody could oppose it, not even the industry. However, an interested bias put the accent on wine--which allegedly should be considered not as alcohol but rather as food, and consequently removed from the law--so that discussion of the draft law became a 'wine war', with predictable consequences. Once again, a draft law on alcohol was shelved sine die and tossed into a corner to gather dust. WithIn this pessimistic scene, though, there are still some positive signs. No economic or political motives should constitute an obstacle to the protection of minors, at the very least.

Ok, I am exhausted by this.. I cannot fathom the fact that Shopify fails to show prices with and without VAT properly. Ridiculous. My currency is SEK.. I downloaded Exemptify to display prices in both VAT and without. I added the snippet under the head as instructed.. Then when I look at my cart with a product, the vat prices look distorted. Absolutely ridiculous. Sorry if I sound angry but I am. Customers are not the most intelligent creatures and if they go to the checkout page and find "hidden" fees I am screwed.. I attached a picture.. I am on the same boat :-/. I will be following this topic to see if anyone has an answer.

Gravity Rush’s art draws heavily from the Franco-Belgian comic book style “bande dessinee” from the 1800-1920s, which is marked by exaggerating elements that the reader should pay the most attention to.. The art style is accompanied by a soundtrack reminiscent of the era, with strong accordion-driven scores. The result is a highly atmospheric game environment that is beautiful as much as it is addictive.

The Chief Whip said that the Congress leaders were trying to lead protests, based on lies. The only objective of the Congress party is to tarnish the image of IT Minister K Taraka Rama Rao (KTR), who has nothing to do with the incident, he added.. Dalits and Nerella victims are unhappy with the Congress party's efforts to turn a law & order issue into an issue for Vote bank politics, he observed. "The Congress's allegations of sand mafia against Minister KTR are laughable," he commented.. During the Congress regime, less than Rs 10 crores was added to the governement's exchequer, against revenue collected from the supply of sand from the 23 districts of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, Eshwar remarked. The sand policy being implemented in the state of Telangana is today, inspiring the nation, he added.. Please submit your comments.

Fish full life-cycle testing for 17beta-estradiol on medaka (Oryzias latipes).
We studied the chronic effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) on the reproductive status of medaka (Oryzias latipes) over two generations under continuous exposure to assess its hazard on this species. The exposure of parental (F0) medaka to E2 was begun on embryos within 12 h postfertilization and continued for up to 101 d; the assessment endpoints included embryological development, hatching, posthatch survival, growth, sexual differentiation, reproduction, and hepatic vitellogenin (VTG) levels under flow-through exposure to E2 at each mean measured concentration of 0.939, 2.86, 8.66, 27.9, and 92.4 ng/L. Eggs (F1) spawned from the F0 fish at 98, 99, and 100 d posthatch were also examined for hatchability, survival after hatching, growth, sexual differentiation, and hepatic VTG level until 59 d posthatch. In the F0 medaka, no concentration-related effect of E2 was observed on hatching, posthatch mortality, and growth. However, we observed abnormal sex differentiation, induction of VTG, and reproductive impairment in a dose-dependent manner. The lowest-observed-effect concentration and no-observed-effect concentration of E2 for these effects were 8.66 and 2.86 ng/L, respectively. In the F1 medaka treated with E2 at < or = 8.66 ng/L, however, dose-dependent effects were not observed in any parameter. The results indicate that E2 can have significant effects on reproductive potential of medaka at concentrations as low as 8.66 ng/L, suggesting that the ecological risk of E2 is higher than that of weak estrogens, such as nonylphenol and octylphenol.

Description: “Herbal chocolate tea made from the shell of the cacao bean.”. Review: I admit that I am a huge chocolate fan, so when MiCaco reached out to me and offered to let me try their tisane, I couldn’t say no! The tisane is made out of 100% cacao and is a blend of shell and nibs of the cacao bean.. The dry cacao was earthy and sweet, with a scent of dark chocolate, which became more pronounced when wet. The steeped liquor tasted earthy and fruity, with a lingering chocolate aftertaste. The aroma was sweet and chocolatey.. I could see this tisane tasting really nice with some additives such as milk which would make the liquor creamier. I would love to dry more chocolate teas in the future (3/5 rating).. 2 comments on “MiCacao’s Natural Cacao Tea | Tea Review”. That is one I definitely need to try!. I’m sorry! I thought I replied. I really enjoyed it. 🙂

When the grandkids come I give one of them a bandana to hold out of sight, I sneeze and tell Rocky to go find me a hanky. Of course, he gives them all the once over (to squeals of delight!) until he finds the one with the bandana. When he brings it to me he gets a treat.

The43 old tree frog used to say that it made him feel better just to see their knees coming toward him.. This tree frog is widespread in the coastal lowlands and in the Tepalcatepec Valley up to elevations of about 1200 meters.. The tree frog was also out, sitting in a cool, damp corner of125 the grass rows.. If they had but known it, the tree frog at that minute had ten legs, for six and four are ten.. The tree frog said that he remembered perfectly well when the eggs were laid on the wild cherry tree on the edge of the23 meadow.. There were screams of night birds, the long note of the owl, the tree frog beseeching stridently for rain.. You have acted as lazy as the tree frog says boys and girls sometimes do.. The leaves of this tree and especially its saplings, are favorite foraging places for the tree frog.. The tree frog and the eatable frog live in the north of Nippon.. For an answer to this the tree frog ran out his tongue, and, sure enough, it was fastened at the front end.

This just in from Pierre Lafond:. Hi,.. Santa Barbara Winery has been in its current location since 1965. We are very excited to have Lafond Winery tasting room coming to town! Customers will have a great view of the actual production. We have a glass door that leads to our bottling warehouse so they will be able to get a view of what goes on behind the scenes!. Cheers!.

Regulation of osteoclast apoptosis by Bcl-2 family protein Bim and Caspase-3.
Apopotosis of osteoclasts is regulated by the Bcl-2 family protein Bim. Bim is degraded in the course of osteoclast apoptosis, which is regulated by Caspase-3. Osteoclasts generated from caspase-3 -/- mice exhibited a shorter life span and a higher bone-resorbing activity than those generated from normal littermates. These results suggest the important role of Caspase-3-Bim axis in regulating both apoptosis and activation of osteoclasts.

Severity of acid gastroesophageal reflux assessed by pH metry: is it associated with respiratory disease?
About 50% of children with chronic respiratory diseases (RD) have "silent" gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Our purpose was to evaluate the possibility that RD in patients with GER reflects the presence of more severe acid reflux. We compared the severity of parameters from pH studies in children with chronic RD and "silent" GER, to children with signs of symptomatic gastrointestinal (GI) GER with and without RD. This study included 236 children (aged 1 month to 15 years) with abnormal 24-hr pH monitoring among 718 patients studied for suspected diagnosis of GER. Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 consisted of children with chronic RD but without any GI symptoms of GER. Group 2 was comprised of children with symptomatic GI presentation of GER such as regurgitation, vomiting, heartburn, and failure to thrive, but without any signs or symptoms of RD. Group 3 included children with prevalent RD and concomitant signs of symptomatic GER. Patients with predominant GI manifestations (group 2) had a significantly higher fraction of time with pH <4 (P < 0.01), total time value of pH <4 (P < 0.05), and longest episode with pH <4 (P < 0.05). Esophageal clearance was significantly longer in group 1 patients than in the other two groups (P < 0.05). Patients with mixed disease (group 3) were similar to patients in group 2. Patients with GI symptoms had significantly worse scores for all parameters evaluated except esophageal clearance score, compared to patients without GI symptoms. Longer esophageal clearance was the only parameter associated with respiratory signs in patients with respiratory symptoms compared to those without. In conclusion, the presence of RD in pediatric patients with silent GER is related to longer esophageal clearance, but is not related to severity of reflux.

[Ultrasonic mammography: its importance in integrated diagnosis of breast diseases (author's transl)].
Sonography of the breast is gaining in importance with the spread of diagnostic methods based on ultrasound in general and the increasing technical perfection of the equipment in particular. Over and above this, the increase in incidence of carcinoma of the breast at an increasingly early age represents a permanent challenge to achieve further optimisation of diagnostic methods. The following conclusions have been arrived at after evaluating 493 ultrasonic examinations of the breast, 212 of which were verified histologically (90 carcinomas): 1. If the indication is precise, sonography possesses a high degree of sensitivity in diagnosing any changes occurring in the breast. 2. The method offers particular advantages in patients with manifest signs having a dense parenchyma; in fact, with such patients sonography is often superior to mammography. 3. The additional use of sonography in diagnosis of diseases of the breast improves the results and often facilitates a less aggressive procedure (insofar as biopsies can be omitted). The main drawbacks are the great amount of time required for performing the examination, and the problem of documentation. This has been the major obstacle to using sonography in screening. The article discusses the indications, the typical sonographic criteria and problems of differential diagnosis in relation to the most frequently encountered diseases of the breast.

Furniture. Furniture. A piece of furniture serves two parameters – function and aesthetics within a given space. The furniture contains values of human need, it can be a human gesture, storage function or any experience dependent on the tenant and his various needs. The furniture creates a dialogue with itself as an object or sculpture in space and with furniture adjacent to it. The furniture creates a dialogue with itself as an object or sculpture in space and with furniture adjacent to it. The furniture gets a visual meaning since beyond its being a function, most of the daytime meets an aesthetic visual need.. The furniture is an object whose design is timeless and is not trendy and the thought of integrating it into space combines long-term thought. We combine three different furniture systems, which vary in size: furniture that is planned in detail by us, furniture that is purchased as new and existing furniture, which contains a dimension of obsolescence and other time.

AMD Threadripper 3rd Generation. AMD continues to impress with its new Desktop processor “Threadripper” third-generation CPU which is indeed an improvement on its predecessor.. What makes it a better performer than its 2nd gen predecessor?. The major difference between the two generations is the allocation of the memory controller. Previous gen processor allocated memory controller to certain memory die only. This resulted in the memory die without a memory controller to take an entire cycle in CPU to reach the ones with it.. Third Generation Threadripper has improved upon it by making a single I/O die which would have all the chiplets connected to. I/O die has PCX, memory access, SATA connection, and many more. Contrary to its predecessor, every chiplet can now access the memory directly and can contain 6 or 8 cores.

Q:

How to allow acces to a symbolic link in my ~/Sites/ for Apache under Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2

I need allow access to a sym-linked directory within ~/Sites from my Apache.
I Symlinked the directories like this
ln -s ~/path/to/the/source/directory/ ~/Sites/source-link-here

Now whenever I fire up a GET request I get a 403 reply
curl http://localhost/~username/source-link-here/
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
<title>403 Forbidden</title>
</head><body>
<h1>Forbidden</h1>
<p>You don't have permission to access /~username/source-link-here
on this server.</p>
...

How can I tell Apache to allow acces to the symlinked directory and how do I tell Apache
to allow this only for requests fired from localhost.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Best regards

    Allow from all
</Directory>

Edit the /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf file and make sure the line under “# Virtual hosts” is not commented out, like so:
Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

Edit the /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf file and add:

Present at the Creation: Planetary Resources, the Silicon Valley of Space

While it has been the cause of significant buzz, relatively little has been known about the company Planetary Resources other than the names of its A-list founders and backers that include James Cameron, Google's Eric Schmidt, Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Peter Diamandis, founder of the X Prize.

It's an impressive group, and that is why investor Ross Perot Jr. was not alone in his sentiment when he said "I believe in the team - betting on the jockey, not the horse."

Planetary Resources promises to be a fast horse as well. The company plans to send a fleet of droids to space to prospect the most valuable near-Earth asteroids. The project, which will require billions of investment dollars, could yield a trillion dollar reward, as precious metals exist in almost infinite quantities in space.

We learned a great deal more about the company yesterday at a public unveiling at the Museum of Flight in Seattle where the founders of Planetary Resources outlined their plan to "add tens of billions of dollars to the GDP annually."

"Since my early teenage years, I've wanted to be an asteroid miner," said founding member Peter Diamandis. "Now, the vision of my colleagues makes that dream not only a reality, but something we need to do."

Here's what Planetary Resources has done, and what they plan to do down the road.

The company has set up shop in Bellevue, WA, and currently employees two dozen engineers. "We're starting the Silicon Valley of space up here in Seattle," the founders announced. Indeed, part of the purpose of the public unveiling was to get the word out, as the company says it is looking to find "the world's best engineers."

"Not only can small groups of people change the world, it's the only thing that ever has."

If that statement has been true throughout history, Diamandis says a few important developments have enabled this specific innovation. These are:

Exponentially-growing technology is enabling small corporations using lower-cost robotics and spacecraft to do what only governments could do before.

Commercial space flight has finally arrived

Risk-tolerant investors like Elon Musk and Richard Branson have been willing to invest in space.

What this will enable Planetary Resources to do is "bring the solar system within our area of economic influence" said co-founder Eric Anderson. In other words, near-Earth asteroids in our solar system hold two enormously valuable resources in great abundance. These are:

Water: H20 is for drinking, of course, but also for propulsion. This resource will allow Planetary Resources to drastically reduce the cost of space exploration and open up "space gas stations" to support mining missions that will open up the road to deep space exploration.

Precious metals: Metals like platinum are useful in all sorts of industrial applications - from microelectronics to medical devices to catalytic converters.

So the founders of Planetary Resources clearly have their eyes on the prize -- but which prize precisely remains the question. There are nearly 9,000 discovered near-Earth asteroids to choose from, which represent 1 percent of the asteroids we believe to exist.

So the company plans to zero in on the specific asteroids they want to target, study the rotation rate, potential, and necessary support resources.

While they aren't afraid to dream big, the founders of Planetary Resources admit there's "a significant probability that we could fail, but we believe that the attempt is worth it." Indeed, they plan to live and learn from their failures, said Chris Lewicki, President & Chief Engineer of Planetary Resources.

While the task is indeed difficult, the founders pointed out that companies like Shell and others have created "fully robotic cities on the bottom of the ocean to drill for oil. This looks easy by comparison."

And what about the timeline? While the founders said "we come from the Burt Rutan school of not giving out timelines," Peter Diamandis did offer this explanation: "We aim to identify the first asteroids to prospect within the decade."

Broward Deputies Vote ‘No Confidence’ On Sheriff Israel

Broward Deputies Vote ‘No Confidence’ On Sheriff Israel

The deputies of Broward County have issued a stunning rebuke of Sheriff Scott Israel by voting “no confidence” in his leadership.

The deputies voted “no confidence” by a 534-94 margin and will ask Florida Governor Rick Scott to remove Israel from his position.

Sheriff Israel has faced intense scrutiny for the way he handled the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February.

Deputy Scot Peterson, the school resource officer on duty at the time of the shooting, waited outside when it was clear what was going on inside the school. It was later revealed that even after additional deputies arrived on scene, they waited behind their cars instead of entering the school and trying to eliminate the threat. The deputies were reportedly given an order to “stand down.” (RELATED: Broward County Sheriff Denies Mishandling Shooting Response)

Through my art, I want to reinforce the idea that it is important to take care of ourselves and reduce the risk of infection by wearing a mask. A mask is our current medicine, and I want to remind people through my art that we can reduce the risk of getting infected and instead stay healthy by wearing a mask, washing our hands, and maintaining social distance.

Farman F.160

__NOTOC__

The Farman F.160 was a heavy bomber aircraft developed in France in the late 1920s. It was essentially an attempt by Farman Aviation Works to modernise its tremendously successful F.60 Goliath design of the immediately postwar years. The most noticeable external difference was the larger tailfin of the new aircraft. Like its predecessor, it was a large three-bay biplane of conventional configuration with unstaggered wings of equal span. Initially conceived as a heavy night bomber, most examples built were float-equipped torpedo bombers for the Aéronautique Maritime, which operated some 40 of the F.165 variant and 200 of the F.168. One of the original F.160 night bombers was exported to Italy, and one to Japan. Plans to develop airliner versions did not progress past the prototype stage.

Variants
F.160 Four-seat night bomber with two  Farman 12We engines, designated F.160 BN.4 by Aviation Militaire.
F.161 One airliner with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Akx engines and one bomber similar to the F.160, powered by 2x  Farman 12Wers engines.
F.162 One prototype airliner with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Akx engines.
F.163 Airliner with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Aa engines.
F.165 Seaplane torpedo bomber with 2x Gnome-Rhône 9A  or 9Aa engines.
F.166 2x  Salmson 9Ab engines.
F.167 Seaplane torpedo bomber with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Aa engines.
F.168 Seaplane torpedo bomber with Gnome-Rhône 9Akx engines; main production version, 200 built.
F.169 Improved airliner version with Gnome-Rhône 9Akx engines.
F.268 One F.168 fitted with 2x supercharged  Salmson 18 Abs engines.
F.269 One F.169 fitted with floats and modified wings as a sesquiplane seaplane.
F.368 One F.168 re-engined with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Kbrs engines.

H. Clay Earles

Henry Clay Earles (August 11, 1913 – November 16, 1999) was the founder and chairman of the board of Martinsville Speedway, a NASCAR stock car racing track that Earles built in 1947 in Ridgeway, Virginia that was one of the circuit's first paved oval tracks and stands as one of its shortest.

Born in Axton, Virginia on August 11, 1913, Earles started making money as a five-year-old, selling unwanted leaves from his father's tobacco farm. Initially educated in a one-room schoolhouse, he dropped out of school so that he could help support his family with the 25 cents he earned each hour at a furniture factory.

His first business venture was a failed pool hall, but a gas station was successful and its profits helped pay for a drive-in restaurant in Martinsville, Virginia. The restaurant was sold to buy another gas station. Having seen the crowds attracted by car racing at temporary tracks at fairgrounds, he built a track on  of land he had purchased in 1946. The first scheduled race, predating the establishment of NASCAR, took place on September 7, 1947, drawing more than 6,000 spectators at a facility that only had 750 seats; Seating capacity had grown to 86,000 by the time of Earles' death. In its inaugural year, Bill France, Sr. provided the track with advertising and drivers in exchange for one-fourth of profits, and became the founding president of NASCAR when it was incorporated the next year. Martinsville Speedway is the only one of NASCAR's original tracks still in use.

Red Byron was awarded a $500 prize for winning the inaugural race at the track, which had grown to $170,000 by 1999. Earles began a tradition in 1964 of distributing grandfather clocks to race winners, with Richard Petty receiving a track-record of 12, and would have received three more for wins that predated the inception of the practice.

The track measures  around, with a pair of  straightaways and tight turns banked at 12 degrees, described as two dragstrips with tight turns. The track was first paved in 1955. Unlike the superspeedways, Martinsville became a track where the skill and strategy of each individual driver could overcome the big money and horsepower of the larger teams.

Earles died at age 86 on November 16, 1999 at his Martinsville home.

SIDEBAR: Strub recounts how he took activism to the streets, and the Church

by Chuck Colbert

One need not be Roman Catholic to understand that Sean Strub’s new book “Body Counts” is in no small measure fueled partly by his faith. From the very beginning, Strub calls out the Church and its hierarchical leadership on many fronts, everything from hypocrisy to hostility, as the AIDS epidemic continues to wreak havoc on gay men and others.

The preface, for example, recounts AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power’s (ACT UP) liturgical disruption, staged on Sunday, Dec. 10, 1989 at New York’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral, arguably a major power center of American Catholicism. Inside, Strub was among the protestors.

Indeed, crashing then-Cardinal John O’Connor’s Sunday Mass was controversial, if not the most controversial of ACT UP’s activism.

“After Mass, I pass through the cathedral’s heavy doors into bright sunlight, and it seems to me into the arms of my true community,” Strub wrote. “I am exultant, in a state that feels like grace, certain that if I am to die of AIDS, I will die a fighter.”

In chapter 17, Strub’s sharpened quill reminds readers that O’Connor “condemned LGBT activism, opposed anti-discrimination statutes, called homosexuality an ‘intrinsic evil,’” at the same time he “prevented groups of gay Irish-Americans from participating in the annual St. Patrick’s Day parade and kicked Dignity, the gay Catholic group, out of all facilities controlled by the archdiocese, where they had celebrated Mass for many years.”

Strub recalled how New York City’s cardinal archbishop banned church-run hospitals from distributing condoms or discussing safe sex with patients, even as staff nurses, doctors and nuns widely ignored his directive.

Most egregious perhaps, O’Connor funded a disinformation campaign, claiming on billboards, buses and subways that “condoms don’t work,” by citing discredited statistics that suggested a 50 percent failure rate or greater. The cardinal “even opposed condom use between two partners when one was known to be HIV positive.”

“At the same time,” Strub wrote, “O’Connor took every opportunity to boast the Church’s compassion toward people with AIDS who were dying in church-run hospices. His hypocrisy was galling; most of the world hated gay people when we were healthy and sexually active but accepted us as dying ‘AIDS’ victims.”

The last straw for Strub and others was the cardinal’s blocking safer-sex education via condom use in New York City schools. “We knew we had to do something,” Strub wrote, explaining in part ACT UP’s decision to disrupt Mass.

During a recent telephone interview, Stub, who for a short time thought he had a calling to the priesthood, spoke of his Irish Catholic upbringing. “I certainly grew up in a Catholic environment,” he said, noting his father’s devotion to the Blessed Virgin. Nuns raised his mother, an orphan.

And yet Strub acquired “skepticism about the Church,” growing up in Iowa City, Iowa, a college town where he was “exposed to a lot of different kinds of values and perspectives,” he said. Just as Strub absorbed Catholicism’s social justice tradition, so he learned the “you-will-do-as-we-are-told aspect of the Church,” he said.

“When I came out in the late 70s, that started a fissure with the Church that only grew over time,” as the epidemic only exacerbated the rift. With the death of his partner Michael in 1988, Strub said, “I went into a kind of hyperactive activist overdrive.”

The cover of “Body Counts” features a picture of Strub and then-partner Michael Misove.

Strub also discussed the historical significance of taking AIDS activism to a nerve center of the Catholic Church in America. Undoubtedly controversial, Strub always favored the St. Patrick’s Cathedral protest. “If one scans the list of who got arrested” — Strub was not — “half inside and half outside,” he said, “the preponderance of those inside were culturally Catholic with Irish, Italian, and Polish surnames. That explains what drove a lot of the action. A lot [of those arrested] grew up in the Church and still felt some right, some piece of ownership that we could take our redress to the Church. For me, it was the culmination of a year’s mourning.”

For all the controversy, opposition and risk, ACT UP decided to go ahead with the protest. “We did it anyway because it was so important,” said Strub, noting, from historical hindsight, its historical significance: “December 1989 was 20 years after Stonewall. While Stonewall was the first time the gay community kind of really fought back against the civil code that oppressed us, and it was landmark, opening up a floodgate of a whole generation protesting the civil code.”

By comparison, Strub continued, “The action at St. Pat’s was the first time we did that against the religious and moral code. We did the unthinkable and took it to their turf. And I think that also opened up the floodgates. Right about then marked a peak moment of influence for the Catholic Church in America. It has declined ever since not just because of that action. It was the sex scandals and all that.”

Sure enough, he said, “We took [Church leaders] down a peg, and they never recovered in terms of their political influence. In a sense, that St. Pat’s action ranks up there with Stonewall in terms of importance.”

Monosaccharide Derivatives with Low-Nanomolar Lectin Affinity and High Selectivity Based on Combined Fluorine-Amide, Phenyl-Arginine, Sulfur-π, and Halogen Bond Interactions.
The design of small and high-affinity lectin inhibitors remains a major challenge because the natural ligand binding sites of lectin are often shallow and have polar character. Herein we report that derivatizing galactose with un-natural structural elements that form multiple non-natural lectin-ligand interactions (orthogonal multipolar fluorine-amide, phenyl-arginine, sulfur-π, and halogen bond) can provide inhibitors with extraordinary affinity (low nanomolar) for the model lectin, galectin-3, which is more than five orders of magnitude higher than the parent galactose; moreover, is selective over other galectins.

Abstract. To achieve very high data rates (>109 bits/s) in optical data storage systems it is necessary to employ a large number of laser beams for parallel read–write–erase operations. Bringing all these beams to diffraction-limited focus with a high-numerical-aperture objective lens (while maintaining focus and tracking) requires techniques that are fundamentally different from those that are currently practiced in the field of optical data storage. We present two possible solutions to the problem of designing an objective lens for such systems, one involving an array of high-quality lenslets and the other based on a single, high-numerical-aperture annular-field-of-view conventional lens. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, on which we elaborate in the course of our discussions.. © 1999 Optical Society of AmericaFull Article | PDF Article

Abstract. This paper analyses the changing nature of relationships between adults and young people. Adopting aspects of the work of Frank Furedi, the question of the socialisation of children is addressed. It is argued that the problematisation of behaviour, coupled with the development of new state and institutional processes, has led to a growing spread of ‘professional’ and contractual involvement in everyday life. This is something that relates to and is accelerated by the emergence of micro-politics and micro-social policy over the last few decades. This colonisation of the lifeworld, it is argued, is increasingly formalising informal relationships and undermining spontaneous relationships between adults and young people. It also distorts the nature of professions and the relationships developed between them and young people. The real relationships between adults and young people are consequently being undermined and replaced by an ersatz form of socialisation.

Psychiatric disorders and general medical conditions: implications for the clinician.
Patients with severe mental illness have higher than expected prevalence rates of co-morbid general medical conditions, particularly metabolic and cardiovascular disease. They are also at increased risk of contracting HIV. Conversely, these and other medical disorders also increase the risk of developing mental disorders. Mental illness and general medical conditions have mutually adverse effects on long-term outcome. This interaction of diseases contributes significantly to the excess morbidity in and higher than expected standard mortality ratios for patients with mental illness. As medical practice becomes more specialized and arguably compartmentalized it may increasingly fail to integrate health care for patients with severe mental illness. In this paper we discuss the high co-morbidity of mental illness with other medical disorders as well some of the potential mechanisms involved. We furthermore argue that the bidirectional relationship between mental and medical disorders should be considered in the planning of treatment for either group of disorders. The central role of the psychiatrist in co-ordinating and integrating the health care of patients with severe mental illness is emphasized.

In order to improve viewing angle dependency of γ characteristics of a liquid crystal display device (e.g. prevent excess brightness etc. of a screen), there have been proposed liquid crystal display devices (based on a pixel-division system, see Patent Literature 1 for example) for controlling a plurality of sub-pixels in one pixel so that the plurality of sub-pixels have different luminances and displaying a halftone by area coverage modulation of these sub-pixels.
FIG. 49 is a schematic view showing an example of a pixel structure of a liquid crystal display device 1000 of Patent Literature 1. The liquid crystal display device 1000 includes a scanning signal line 1002 and a data signal line 1003 that are provided on a glass substrate 1001 and a pixel 1004 provided in the vicinity of an intersection of the two signal lines. The pixel 1004 consists of two sub-pixels 1005a and 1005b. The two sub-pixels 1005a and 1005b include transistors 1006a and 1006b and pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b connected with the transistors 1006a and 1006b, respectively, and the pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b form capacitors (retention capacitors 1009a and 1009b) with retention capacitor lines 1008a and 1008b, respectively. Although not shown, the pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b are designed such that a liquid crystal material (liquid crystal layer) is sandwiched between the glass substrate 1001 and a common electrode (counter electrode) on a surface of a substrate (color filter substrate).
FIG. 50 is a drawing showing an electrically equivalent circuit corresponding to the pixel structure shown in FIG. 49 of the liquid crystal display device 1000. The pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b shown in FIG. 49 correspond to points 1010a and 1010b shown in FIG. 50, respectively, and form liquid crystal capacitors 1012a and 1012b, respectively, with a common electrode 1011.
In the above configuration, different signals are supplied to the retention capacitor lines 1008a and 1008b, respectively. This allows differentiating potentials (pixel potentials) of the pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b from each other.

Article Text. Abstract. Suppression scotomas and retinal projection (retinal correspondence) were measured in six intermittent exotropes during deviation. Measurements used red-green anaglyph stimuli presented on a black background which could be varied from 3.4 minutes of arc to 3 degrees 24'. Results showed non-suppression of all points between the fovea and the diplopia point. Harmonious anomalous retinal correspondence was usually observed. Two subjects had spontaneous changes from anomalous retinal correspondence to normal retinal correspondence without a concurrent change in ocular position. Conventional testing resulted in more variable results in regard to retinal correspondence and suppression, suggesting that non-suppression and anomalous retinal correspondence occur when black backgrounds are used.

Effect of Wnt inhibitors in pancreatic cancer.
Activated Wnt signaling in cancer cells leads to cell proliferation. It has been shown that the Wnt pathway is activated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. Therefore, we tested the effect of Wnt inhibitors in human and murine pancreatic cancer cell lines. The Wnt inhibitors ethacrynic acid (EA), ciclopirox olamine (CIC), piroctone olamine (PO) and griseofulvin (GF) were tested in murine and human pancreatic cancer cell lines with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. We showed that the Wnt inhibitors significantly reduced cell viability in murine, as well as human pancreatic cancer cell lines. These results may lead to a new therapeutic option with Wnt inhibitors for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Motives and health-related behaviours: an investigation of equipotentiality and equifinality.
We investigated the phenomena of equipotentiality (one dispositional motive expressed through more than one behaviour) and equifinality (one behaviour serving more than one motive). In a cross-sectional survey, 244 young adults completed measures of sun-related behaviour and risky sexual behaviour, participatory motives for the behaviours and life goals (representing dispositional motives). Equipotentiality was demonstrated, in that power and diversity life goals each predicted more than one behaviour. Equifinality was demonstrated, in that sun exposure and risky sexual behaviour were each predicted by more than one life goal. Participatory motives mediated these relationships. Equipotentiality and equifinality need to be taken into account in health promotion.

Developing academic leaders in Geriatric Psychiatry with clinical/educational and research expertise is a national priority. This proposal is designed to developed the nominee's capability as an independent researcher and resource person in geriatric psychiatry at MCV/VCU. Specifically, the nominee plans to: a) pursue additional training in statistics and epidemiological research methods; b) pursue research supervision from senior faculty at the university and external experts in geriatric psychiatry; c) develop research programs expanding clinical understanding of aggressive behavior in Alzheimer's Disease patients; and d) establish a network of research at MCV/VCU to promote collaborative research in geriatric mental health.

As one of high speeding techniques of image display in an information display control system, there is a technique of using an atlas image (also referred to as a “texture atlas”) in which a plurality of images are unified into one image. Since the plurality of images can be taken out of one texture atlas, the texture atlas is created in advance, whereby a number of readout times of image files is reduced, and a readout time of image data can be shortened.
In an event of creating the texture atlas, it is a challenge to determine how to efficiently arrange the plurality of images, which are different from one another in size, on the texture atlas. In usual, since the images for use in the information display control system are rectangular, this challenge can be handled as a “rectangle packing problem” in which rectangles are arranged on a two-dimensional surface with a fixed area without overlapping one another. A variety of approximate methods are known with regard to the rectangle packing problem. For example, the Best-fit method proposed in following Non-Patent Literature 1 is an algorithm that repeatedly packs rectangles which can use gaps to the maximum.

Inhibition of aflatoxin B1-induced gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase positive (GGT+) hepatic preneoplastic foci and tumors by low protein diets: evidence that altered GGT+ foci indicate neoplastic potential.
Previous studies in this laboratory with young Fischer 344 male rats have shown that the post-initiation development of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase positive (GGT+) hepatic foci was markedly inhibited by low protein feeding, even though the energy intake was greater. This dietary effect, however, did not necessarily apply to hepatic tumor development. Thus, the present investigation was undertaken to examine this dietary effect upon the development of hepatic tumors and, is so doing, to determine the correlation of foci development with tumor development. Following AFB1 dosing (15 daily doses of 0.3 mg/kg each), animals were fed diets containing 6, 14 or 22% casein (5.2, 12.2, 19.1% protein) for 6, 12, 40, 58 and 100 weeks. Foci at 12 weeks and tumors at 40, 58 and 100 weeks developed dose-dependently to protein intake. Foci development, tumor incidence, tumor size and the number of tumors per animal were markedly reduced while the time to tumor emergence was increased with low protein feeding. Non-hepatic tumor incidence also was lower in the animals fed the lowest protein diet. Foci development indices (foci number, per cent liver volume occupied) were highly correlated with tumor incidence at 58 and 100 weeks (r = 0.90-1.00). Tumor and foci inhibition occurred in spite of the greater energy intake.

The lucky numbers were initially thought to be a way to tell the Tazos apart (i.e. 45 is the highest lucky number, so the thought was that it would be a set of 45), but this has been found to be untrue, and, if sorting Tazos based on their Lucky Numbers, then many gaps will appear in the set. There has, however been found to be only the 3 variations per Tazo, making a complete set of only 30.

Personal Information on Students Slip from Teacher’s PC onto Internet

Personal information relating to around 10,000 students slipped onto the net when a high school teacher in Ichinomiya, Aichi Prefecture, used file-sharing software on his computer that stored the records, the prefecture's board of education said on June 30, 2007.

According to assumptions, the information leaked due to a virus in file-swapping program from a computer located in the residence of the 43-year old teacher employed at Ichinomiya Technical Upper Secondary School.

The teacher said that apart from the students' information, his PC also had the list of ASDF (Association of Synchronous Data Formats) officers who retired from service. His mother had asked him to compile it. She was attached to the Self-Defense Forces, the board of education said, as reported by The Japan Times on July 1, 2007.

The board also reported that the divulged data included records on students of two different schools where the teacher worked. That comprised of 10-years records of 7,000 students from his current school and 5-years records of 7,545 students form his previous school. The information consisted of students' names, birth dates, parents' names and grades.

The exact number of students affected due to the leak is not known as some of the records were in duplicates, the board said. The leak consisted of around 14,600 pieces of information. Personal information relating to personnel of the Air Self -Defense Force's Gifu Air Base in Kakamigahara, Gifu Prefecture, was also leaked from the teacher's computer. The leaked data included rolls of retired staff and everything about the events that took place at the base.

The education board said the leaked information was actually internal data saved since the academic year 1994 at the Technical Upper Secondary School and a high school where the teacher had worked earlier. The information collected was for the purpose of assisting students in choosing their careers. Therefore, it included students' names, careers they wished, academic results, technical school and university entrance exam results, and character evaluations.

The Board said there were no reports of misuse of data so far. But it will apologize to students and their parents and will take action against the teacher.

Democratic leaders are scrambling after a hashtag went viral on Twitter by fed-up Democrats that are walking away from the party. Former Dem loyalists are tired of the far-left rhetoric and alt-left violence — and that’s trouble for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and company come November.

The #Walkaway movement was started by a registered Democrat that decided to walk away from liberalism after deciding that the party was taking advantage of its own racial, sexual, and religious minorities in America.

The campaign quickly caught on with social media users sharing their own walk away stories.

Actor James Woods joined in on the movement sharing his story behind leaving the Democratic party.

Hi, I just recently started looking at HTML5 and noticed the video tag. Neat addition. I also noticed that it as an attribute named 'pixelratio', however, as you know this is never an integer, but rather is the result of a fraction (i.e. ratio). As for proper playback of video frames, it is important to understand exact float and therefore I would suggest either expressing it as a ratio of two 32-bit integers separated by a colon (or slash) or use two different attributes. This avoids unintentional rounding. Something roughly along the lines of: <video pixelratio="10:11"> <!-- 525 composite NTSC --> <video pixelratio="59:54"> <!-- 625 composite PAL --> <video pixelratio="1018:1062"> <!-- 1920x1035 HDTV SMPTE RP 187-1995 --> <video parhSpacing="10" parvSpacing=11"> Container formats tend to store this information in a ratio like this and not in a float.

A couple of months ago, we got excited because we saw Charlton station had gained a new water fountain. It was all part of a London-wide plan to provide more drinking water taps, and reduce the need for people to buy plastic bottles of water. There was a heatwave on, it sounded fantastic.. Then a few weeks after it opened, it was covered up again. And moved. It’s still covered up today. Our refillable bottles have remained unfilled.. We asked Thames Water what was going on. A spokesperson got back to us very quickly and told us: “At the moment the water coming from the fountain isn’t of the standard we’d expect so we can’t let anyone use it until it passes all the right tests.”. Thames Water emphasises there is no issue with water in the wider area – it’s just an issue that affects the fountain.. Hopefully the fountain will be back in service soon.

Statement. My father became a street photographer when he was eighteen in the late 1960’s, and ever since he documented life around him as it is - with artistic thought, but also a quickness of catching the moment as it’s being created. I was always extremely in awe of his work and soon, when he gave me a film camera for my 16th birthday, I started following his path of catching the moments around me.

Can a hill vanish? Apparently yes!

At least that is what the Rajasthan government has told the Supreme Court. During the hearing of a case related to the illegal minings in Aravalli, the Rajasthan Government told the Apex Court that 28 out of 138 hills in Aravalli region near Delhi border have disappeared.

The Supreme Court bench comprising Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta was, however, not convinced, and asked the government if people had become Hanuman and they are running away with the hills.

The court which observed that Rajasthan has taken the issue of illegal mining "very lightly" and ordered the government to stop all illegal mining in a 115.34-hectare area in Aravalli hills within 48 hours.

The apex court also referred to a central empowered committee report that 31 hills or hillocks have vanished in the state's Aravalli area.

The court also noted that the disappearance of hills in Rajasthan could be one reason for the rise in pollution levels in Delhi.

A Message from Our CEO. Dear Guests,.. My vision is to provide a sanctuary for each and every guest in a peaceful environment that will allow for relaxation, rejuvenation and a place to re-energize ones’ spirit. We are all “caretakers” in one way or another and often we forget about the person most important – ourselves. Caretakers often forget that “self-care” is tremendously important. We must all remind ourselves that giving time to yourself is not selfish. Taking care of one’s “SELF” first, makes taking care of others so much easier.. Namaste,. Julie Nguyen

Archive Article: 1997/12/12. From Arthur Staniforth, Summertown, Oxford. The first tractor I drove was a Fordson "red-spot". It was fitted with spade lugs and belonged to the Somerset War Agricultural Committee.. A student at Reading University, my holiday job was to go round ploughing up grass fields that had been scheduled by the War Ag. I had the old road menders caravan to live in and steel bands to put round the tractor wheels for road travel.. It was good tractor and pulled a two-furrow Ransome plough. Petrol was used for start up with TVO being switched to when it had warmed up. Starting it in the morning was the hardest part – it took some swinging and had a kick like a mule: Never put your thumb round the handle.. By present day standards the seat was incredibly uncomfortable and I spent most of the time when ploughing standing up – there was just enough room for that.

Brattain–Hadley House

The Brattain–Hadley House was located in Springfield, Oregon and was formerly listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Fire destroyed much of the house in 1997, and in 2012 a demolition contractor removed the house for safety reasons.

Paul Brattain, an 1852 pioneer, obtained a 160-acre donation land claim soon after moving from Iowa to Oregon. The Brattain farm was entirely within modern Springfield city limits.

When Brattain died in 1893, his descendants built the Queen Anne style house. Paul Hadley, Brattain's grandson, was the last of Brattain's descendants to occupy the house in the 1940s. Hadley's daughter, Mary Hadley Callis, allowed vagrants to occupy the house until the 1997 fire.  The house was removed from the National Register on May 8, 2012.

I only started reading this book because my grandma gave it to me for christmas and told me that it was "a wonderful book that made me think of you". I put off reading it for about 6 months but then I didn't have any new books to read so I picked this one up. Belive me, I don't like reading non-fiction books, so it's pretty amazing that a real-life story about a cat pulled me in so fast. It's a really interesting yet funny book, so good that I made excuses to use it for my "survival" unit in school. *warning* I got a little bit tierd with all of the cat stuff as the book went on.

The ERA Toronto team recently had the privilege to head out to LA for a few days and join up with our LA team to do a few rooms in the area between our visits to Hollywood and Six Flags. One of the companies we got to visit during our trip was Xscape Pods. Xscape Pods are a relatively new company, having been in business for just over a year. They’re a small, family-owned company who have done a good job of coming up with some cool and unique room designs.

Finding our way to Xscape Pods was fairly straightforward. They’re located in a strip mall, so there was plenty of parking, and they had a nice big sign above their storefront. The lobby was very creatively decorated, with quite a sci-fi feel, some nice comfy couches, and a few unique and interesting decorations. We were given a warm welcome by the owners, after which we watched a short rules video and then we were off to play the room! The intro video was shown in the room itself; unfortunately, due to some technical difficulties, we only got to see about the first half, but it was still enough to get the gist and set the tone for the game to come.

The room itself felt slightly spartan, but this was appropriate given that it was supposed to be a generic government office. The props felt authentic enough and got the job done, although a few of them were starting to show signs of some wear and tear. One puzzle was a little bit fiddly, but another puzzle did a good job of making use of a cool, high-tech prop that really added to the atmosphere.

The immersion was decent, with background music and sound effects evoking a military base. Again, we missed out on some of the intro video due to technical difficulties, so the story was a little unclear, and there didn’t appear to be much by way of story development as we progressed. One cool reveal helped pull us back into the story for a bit, but at other times we were simply going through the motions.

Similarly, the puzzles generally felt merely competent. There were no team-building puzzles, no big “wow” moments, and quite a few coding/decoding puzzles. Most things made sense, and there weren’t any large leaps of logic required, but at a few points we found ourselves a little lost and unsure what to tackle next.

In the end, we did enjoy ourselves while playing this room, but weren’t necessarily blown away by it. There were a few cool moments, but nothing that really made it stand out. Overall though still a solid room and worth playing should you find yourself in the area.

It is common in many industries that various materials or mixtures of materials require drying at some stage of processing. One example is the drying of (i.e. the removal of water from) coal and coal wash fines in the mining industry. Traditionally, industrial drying has been accomplished through application of heat to bring a moisture laden material to elevated temperatures so that the moisture will evaporate and/or boil away from the material. This approach, however, requires large amounts of energy to produce and apply the heat. This energy is usually derived from the burning of fossil or other fuels, which is not very efficient, is not generally eco-friendly, and in fact is a pollution generator in its own right. At least partially for these reasons, the burning of fossil fuels in the coal mining industry to dry material such as coal wash fines is strictly regulated.
In addition to drying needs, there are industrial needs for transitioning a substance with a vapor pressure threshold from one phase to another phase. Examples include, distilling, mixing, desalinating, recovering oil from oil shale and oil sands, recovering purified distilled water from contaminated water, distilling alcohols from a mash or other mixture, and many others. Desalinization of seawater to produce potable water is one example of a desalinating application. Traditional techniques for desalinizing seawater have tended to require large amounts of externally generated energy in the form of heat, which, again, usually involves the burning of fossil fuels, is exceedingly inefficient, and generally is not eco-friendly. Artificial snow-making also is an industry where the making of artificial snow from water is energy intensive and inefficient, and produces a poor substitute for natural snow. Pond evaporation is another example of an industry that consumes large amounts of energy to produce heat for boiling water or other substances, pollutes the atmosphere, and is generally inefficient. The above examples represent only a few throughout various industries.
A need exists for methods and systems to perform these and many other related industrial tasks more efficiently, using much less energy, requiring the addition of little or no externally generated heat or thermal energy, and in a manner that produces little or no harmful atmospheric emissions and thus is eco-friendly. It is to the provision of such methods and systems that the present disclosure is primarily directed.

Demons Training Session

Natalie did a surprise appearance at a Demons AFL training session in Melbourne this Wednesday. In town for this weekend’s NGV Gala, she took time out to check out how the Dees were coming along in pre-season.

Apparently, Natalie’s best friend, a big Demons supporter, was the reason behind her visit. Their children took part in the warm-up with the players.

Natalie also donned an AFLW guernsey and there were plenty of fans on social media who were happy with her choice of club. As usual, Zimbio has several photos:

Effect of protein kinase C on amylase secretion and cyclic AMP production in rat pancreatic acinar cells.
The authors examined the effects of protein kinase C on secretin-induced amylase release and cyclic AMP production in rat pancreatic acinar cells. Secretin (10(-6) M) and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (10(-6) M) induced 53% and 60% increase of amylase release from the basal level, respectively during 10 min. Simultaneous addition of TPA and secretin resulted in 42% amylase release from the basal level for 10 min. Suppression of secretin-induced amylase release was evident within 5 min of pretreatment with TPA. TPA showed the same effect on cyclic AMP production; secretin-induced increase of cyclic AMP was suppressed by pretreatment of TPA for 5 min. To explore the mechanism by which TPA inhibits secretin-induced cyclic AMP production, we also examined the effects of protein kinase C purified from rat brain on adenylate cyclase activity in pancreatic acinar membranes. Basal, forskolin- and secretin plus guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]trisphosphate-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity were inhibited by protein kinase C in the presence of Ca++. These results suggest that protein kinase C might have a role in the inhibitory effect on adenylate cyclase in exocrine pancreas.

Transcendental and Optimized Digital Designing Using Reversible Logic. The approach in the reversible logic design differs significantly from the traditional combinational logic design. In reversible logic circuit, the number of input lines should be equal to the number of output lines with each output line being used only once thereby making the resulting circuit acyclic. Thus a reversible logic gate is an n-input, n-output device with one-to-one mapping. This helps in the determination of the outputs from the inputs and vice-versa, i.e. there is one-to-one correspondence between the input and the output vectors..

Lee, Rona (2009) Truthing Gap. [Show/Exhibition]Full text not available from this repository.. Abstract. Oceanographic survey offers no grounding in questions of representation, such as mapping as an expression of power, or inter-subjective relations between observer and observed. Existing practice involves the reprocessing of sonar data to create drained and illuminated, photorealistic, virtual models, over which the disembodied eye may freely roam.. Situated and ‘situationist’, Truthing Gap employed conjectural understanding, participant observation (work with geophysical modelling/mapping software and underwater vehicles/cameras), performative experiments and interventions, alongside alternative modes of data capture and making tactile cartographies, to address the role of representational vocabularies in configuring human/non-human relations and the capacity of contemporary artistic practice to re-think dominant environmental imaginaries..

I just came across an interesting article by Jeffrey Joerres on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal Europe (April 9, 2009) entitled Aging Your Work Force. The article is about the challenge of an aging workforce in Europe and says that “a loss of productivity and intellectual capital as baby boomers leave the work force could devastate some businesses. Europe’s work force will begin shrinking in the coming years and is expected to become 15% smaller within five decades, according to the OECD. The countries with the biggest threat are those with the oldest populations, particularly Germany and Italy.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering applying 25 percent tariffs on around $3.5 billion of imports from the United States if President Donald Trump carries out his plan to apply global duties to steel and aluminum, EU sources say.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

The European Commission has said it would respond “firmly” to proposed U.S. import duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.

It has spelt out it would join others in a challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and consider safeguard measures, last deployed in 2002, to guard against steel and aluminum being diverted to Europe from elsewhere if U.S. tariffs come in.

A further counter-measure under consideration would specifically target the United States to “rebalance” trade between the two, EU sources say.

The U.S. tariffs would be officially brought in on grounds of national security, but the European Union says U.S. military requirements represent no more than 3 percent of U.S. production and that the measures are really a form of protectionism for U.S. manufacturers.

EU exports of steel to the United States in 2017 were worth 5.3 billion euros ($6.53 billion) and of aluminum 1.1 billion euros.

For certain grades of steel, the United States cannot show there was any increase of imports last year, the EU sources say, meaning it would not be allowed to apply safeguard measures to them. For the EU, exports of those grades amounted to 2.8 billion euros ($3.5 billion).

Assuming U.S. tariffs fully covered EU steel, the European Union would put forward 25 percent tariffs on 2.8 billion euros worth of goods from the United States.

About a third would be steel grades, another third other industrial products and a final third agricultural products.

The list of products is set to be presented next week to EU countries, whose approval would be needed.

The “rebalancing” would have to take place within three months.

Explanation of implants is indicated for implant rupture, infection, extrusion, siliconoma, breast pain, painful capsular contracture, malposition, significant patient fear, and systemic symptoms thought secondary to implants. A number of alternatives are available for postexplant reconstruction, including myocutaneous flaps and free tissue transfers.

It's been a long journey, but puzzle platformer Yumi's Odd Odyssey, known as Farewell Umihara Kawase in Japan, will finally be available on the North American 3DS eShop on March 20th, according to publisher Natsume:

This is the first time the series has ever ventured outside of Japan in its 2-decade history, but Natsume has expressed in interviews its desire to bring the latest game to overseas fans, and that digital distribution has been seen as a good way of helping lower the risks and costs involved.

The titular protagonist of Yumi's Odd Odyssey wields a fishing line and hook, swinging, flinging, and navigating herself through a multitude of levels. The series has drawn a cult following of fans outside Japan who came across its unique style in various ways, including a playthrough of the original Super Famicom title on GameCenter CX. No official word has been given regarding a potential release of Yumi's Odd Odyssey in Europe or Australia.

Will you bite on Yumi's Odd Odyssey, or is it just not hooking you? Let us know in the comments.

Sheltair's new $25 million hangar-office complex now open

Aviation development company Sheltair will celebrate the grand-opening of its new $25 million westside office-hangar complex at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport Wednesday, Nov. 13. In October, Sheltair completed the 134,806 square foot facility on more than 11 acres of land on the west side of the airfield, as part of a three-phase development project. (Arlene Satchell)

The roughly $25 million complex marks the completion of the first phase of a three-part development project at the Fort Lauderdale facility that's expected to be done in 2015, Sheltair said.

The aviation development company, which has 20 airport facilities in Florida, New York and Georgia, provides fuel, ground handling and other services to owners and operators of corporate and leisure aircraft. It also builds and leases hangars and office space to aviation-related companies.

"Sheltair strives to be on the cutting edge of aviation construction and development, and this project coupled with the advantages and growth potential at this airport is and will be a wonderful example in the aviation community," Sheltair CEO Jerry Holland said in a statement.

Work on the 134,806-square-foot facility at 1470 Lee Wagener Blvd. was completed in October after breaking ground in April 2012. Spread across more than 11 acres, the complex is the first new general aviation facility to be built on the airport's west side in more than a decade, according to Sheltair.

Increased demand for its services, customers' expanding fleets and the Fort Lauderdale airport's rising international profile were among reasons for the expansion, company officials have said. Sheltair is also seeking to grow its business from Brazil, Mexico, Canada and Europe.

"We are pleased Sheltair Aviation has decided to expand their facilities at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport," said Kent George, the airport's director of aviation.

Beside its traditional services, Sheltair also manages the country's busiest general aviation federal inspection station for international flights here in Fort Lauderdale, George noted.

Tenants in the new facility will have access to Sheltair's round-the-clock terminal, which offers aircraft refueling, cleaning, a 24-hour U.S. Customs office, Hertz car rental, cafe and executive boardroom and other amenities. They'll also have direct access to the airport's new 8,000-foot south runway, now under construction and set to open September 2014.

I ask because I have just ordered some laying pullets expecting chicks on the 28th and today found one of my hens who has been slacking big time on the egg production on the nest. I thought nothing of it and came back later to collect her egg; She was gone from the nest but she had pulled off alot of feathers and looks like she is getting ready to brood. It's bad timing of coarse with all the chicks on the way but maybe I will put a few of my Light Brahma x silkie eggs under her and see if they will hatch. That way if she decides to leave the nest after a few days I won't be so disappointed.

ShinBit is receiving a Melarsomine injection to kill the adult heartworms. So Melarsomine is an adulticide and is the Immiticide referred to in the heartworm treatment report.. Remember the adult worms can live in the heart and pulmonary arteries which is why heartworms get their name. Melarsomine is the only medication currently being used to kill adult heartworms. Because it is injected into the muscles of the back, the injections can be painful.. Doxycycline is also used to kill the Wolbachia organism infection that often accompanies heartworm disease. This organism is thought to also provide some sort of protection for adult heartworms and may cause inflammation in the lungs of the infected animal after the adult heartworms die.. The dying heartworms can cause obstructions in the blood vessels of the lungs. Exercise can increase the risk of an embolism and serious side effects so ShinBi must be kept quiet and inactive during his heartworm treatment.

WILL I HAVE TO EAT AND DRINK THINGS THAT I DON'T LIKE AND TAKE A LOT OF SUPPLEMENTS?

No! You'll never have to eat anything you don't like. But, you'll be encouraged to discover foods that support and nourish you. Over time your taste buds will change and you will start seeking out these foods naturally. With regards to food and drinks it's about switching to healthier options that are right for your body type, as opposed to whatever it is you may have been eating before. But, it's not about perfection - you'll learn to still enjoy 'treat' foods now and again without any bingeing or guilt.

You’ll never be pressured to take any supplements that are suggested to you.

​

CAN I DO THIS IF I HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION?

​

If you have a medical condition, then I recommend sharing the information with your physician/doctor. You can always adjust the meals to accommodate your health needs.

​

Note: This is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

I AM UNABLE TO EAT DAIRY OR GLUTEN AND HAVE OTHER FOOD INTOLERANCES, WILL THIS AFFECT MY ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE?

Not at all. You can list foods that you don't like or have an intolerance to and this is all incorporated into your profile. No matter what your eating habits look like now, this plan will help you to make them better.

​

HOW DOES THIS COURSE RUN?

The first session is creating your online profile and determining your body type through bone measurements and questionnaires. This usually takes one and half hours. After that it is an hour long one on one coaching session every fortnight. We can meet in person, online or over the phone - what ever suits you.

​

WHAT IF I FEEL TOO BUSY TO DO EVERYTHING?

Response of Triatoma infestans to pour-on cypermethrin applied to chickens under laboratory conditions.
This article reports the effects of a pour-on formulation of cypermethrin (6% active ingredient) applied to chickens exposed to Triatoma infestans, the main vector of Chagas disease in rural houses of the Gran Chaco Region of South America. This study was designed as a completely random experiment with three experimental groups and five replicates. Third instar nymphs were fed on chickens treated with 0, 1 and 2 cc of the formulation. Nymphs were allowed to feed on the chickens at different time intervals after the insecticide application. Third-instar nymphs fed on treated chickens showed a higher mortality, took less blood during feeding and had a lower moulting rate. The mortality rate was highest seven days after the insecticide solution application and blood intake was affected until 30 days after the application of the solution.

Allergy and Asthma: Allergic Rhinitis and Allergic Conjunctivitis.
Allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis are among the most common conditions seen in family medicine practice. Most cases are due to seasonal allergens, such as pollens, or year-round allergens, such as dust mites, mold, and animal dander. The clinical diagnosis can be made when symptoms of nasal congestion, sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal or ocular pruritus, or eye tearing are present along with physical findings, such as clear rhinorrhea, pale nasal mucosa, or red watery eyes. Patients should be assessed for any comorbid conditions, such as asthma or eczema, and for symptoms that indicate impaired quality of life, such as poor sleep, daytime somnolence, or irritability. Prevention involves allergen avoidance and environmental controls. Monotherapy with oral antihistamines, intranasal steroids, or intranasal antihistamines are the initial management options for nasal and ocular symptoms. Antihistamine eye drops are fast-acting and safe for management of ocular symptoms; intranasal antihistamines are effective for nasal symptoms. Current guidelines recommend against combining intranasal steroids and oral antihistamines, as this provides no additional benefit. Select patients also may benefit from allergy skin testing or consideration for allergen immunotherapy.

Semiconductor chip power is typically supplied on-chip at a single, predetermined voltage level. Chip designers typically specify a single, predetermined voltage level for reasons of standardization and convenience. Accordingly, as chip standards migrate from one on-chip voltage level to another, difficulties arise during transition periods. During such times of transition, new chips designed to operate at voltage levels according to the new standard voltage level may desirably be mounted on circuit boards and be incorporated into electronic systems designed to operate at the former standard voltage level.
Unfortunately, semiconductor chips designed to the new standard voltage will not generally make provision to accommodate the voltage level previously widely recognized and followed. It is typically presumed that either the entire electronics system into which the new chip design is to be incorporated will operate at the new voltage level, or that some off-chip solution will be provided to create voltage compatibility between subsystems and chips operating at separate voltage level.
Additionally, in the general case, a chip which operates at a given voltage level is not able to recognize that it has been provided with a nonstandard voltage level. There has been a failure of semiconductor chip designers to provide an on-chip solution for power provided at an arbitrary voltage level to be automatically converted to a desired internal operating voltage level. This creates serious compatibility problems for the semiconductor industry daring a period of accelerating miniaturization.
This increased miniaturization of chip geometries in the semiconductor industry makes it increasingly necessary to develop new solutions and chip designs which can accommodate a plurality of on-chip voltage levels. One aspect of the trend toward miniaturization is the use of increasingly thin gate oxide layers for CMOS devices fabricated in the industry. This has resulted in an increased recent motivation and an urgent need for semiconductor circuits to be able to accommodate both 5.0 volt and 3.3 volt on-chip voltage levels. It is anticipated that in the near future even lower on-chip voltage levels, such as for example 2.2 volts and 1.1 volts are likely to develop into the required circuit design norm.
It is accordingly an object of the invention herein to provide an on-chip voltage conversion solution for semiconductor chips manufactured during technology transition periods in which the semiconductor industry worldwide converts from one standard internal semiconductor chip voltage level to another.
It is an object of the invention herein to develop semiconductor circuit chips which are operable at a plurality of internal semiconductor chip voltage levels.
It is yet another object of the invention herein to provide an on-chip semiconductor design approach which converts internal voltage levels from a standard 5.0 voltage level to 3.3 volts.

Q:

central limit theorem VS standard deviation of multiple group means

I understand that we can estimate confidence interval of sample mean using CLT. However, I am wondering if we could treat mean value of each sampled group data as a single data entry and estimate their standard deviation to finish this calculation? Or where is wrong about this approach? An example,
If I have the following 4 groups of measurements, which follows normal distribution with mean=30, stand deviation=10. 
    group_mean  group_sd Ob1     Ob2     Ob3    Ob4     Ob5
group1  33.43   5.92    30.24   43.15   27.49   32.98   33.30
group2  28.92   11.04   32.42   38.83   32.14   31.32   9.91
group3  26.53   7.18    19.34   22.86   33.37   35.11   21.95
group4  28.26   7.43    21.09   28.13   23.19   40.24   28.66

If I treat each group mean as a data point (33.43, 28.92, 26.53, 28.26) and the mean is 29.29 and standard deviation (sample) is 2.94.
So can I assume the confidence interval of sample mean = 29.29 +/- t*2.94??
Thanks in advance!

A:

Theoretically, the standard error is the standard deviation for the sampling distribution.  In this case, what you have proposed is to sample from the sampling distribution 4 times (obtaining 4 means). The standard deviation of these values should provide an approximation for the standard deviation of the sampling distribution...i.e., the standard error. Conceptually, if you are using the correct $t$-distribution (using the correct degrees of freedom), it seems as though this should produce a reasonable result.
Follow-up
I am not convinced this strategy will work unless the correct degrees of freedom are used for the grouped means data set. Here is a brief simulation that shows that you obtain about 2% incorrect conclusions with a 98% confidence interval treating the data as an aggregate data set. But using the group means with different critical values does not produce the same results:

### set random seed
set.seed(1234)
### formula for CI:  x-bar ± t.cv * SD/√n
### t_cv for 98% confidence interval with df=19 (and others)
t.cv <- qt(1-0.02/2,19)
t.cv2 <- qt(1-0.02/2,4)
t.cv3 <- qt(1-0.02/2,16)
### generate data sets with mean 50 and stdev 10
n.sim <- 10^5
check.TF.1 <- rep.int(NA,n.sim)
check.TF.2 <- check.TF.1
check.TF.3 <- check.TF.1
check.TF.4 <- check.TF.1
grps <- ceiling({1:20}/5)
for(i in 1:n.sim) {
   x <- rnorm(20,50,10)
   grp.Ms <- aggregate(x~grps,FUN="mean")[,2]
   CI <- mean(x) + c(-1,1)*t.cv*sd(x)/sqrt(20)

Have you ever watched how contagious a yawn is? If one person in a group yawns, the entire group joins in. This can be explained by empathy. Lack of empathy is the key characteristic that distinguishes a true, pathological, dangerous narcissist, from someone that is just really, really, arrogant.

The same area of the brain is activated in yawn contagion as is activated by empathy. Autistic children, for instance, do not show yawn contagion. Is it possible, that narcissists do not shown yawn contagion either?

I need your help with this. This is what I would like you to do.

1. In a group of average people, friends, co-workers or in line at the store, fake a deep long yawn and then pay attention to how many people yawn as well. This is the control, the first step. It is important to know that your fake yawn works with normal people.

2. If the step above does not result in other people yawning, work on your yawn until it is contagious reliably.

3. Yawn, in a way that you know elicits others to yawn with someone that you know is a narcissist. Observe their response.

4. Report back here, yes or no, whether or not known narcissists have yawn contagion.

One final appeal. This would be an incredibly useful and handy tool if it is accurate. What we don’t know right now is if it is accurate, so I would like you to try it. I know that many of you know narcissists! Please try this. If we had a simple, socially acceptable tool for pre-screening people for narcissism, think of how much simpler our lives would be.

Happy Yawning…

Doors of the European Union (EU) are open for Montenegro- this is what the President of European Parliament Antonio Tajani told in an interview with the public broadcaster of Montenegro (TVCG).

Montenegro is the leader among countries wishing to join the EU and that should happen in 7 years, Tajani also said. “We love Montenegro and we want to cooperate with it. Our doors are open for Montenegro.”

Despite challenges the EU has been recently facing (e.g. the next-year election, Brexit, migrant crisis and the enlargement policy), Tajani hopes our country will join the EU by 2025.

“We have 7 years more. Montenegro could become the full EU member state if only we worked hard. We also have to improve the stability of the EU. Montenegro is a frontrunner for 2025 EU membership,” Tajani told.

The European Parliament President emphasizes our country plays a key role for the stability of the Western Balkans, which is also very important for the stability of the EU.

Two Healthy Diets Modulate Gut Microbial Community Improving Insulin Sensitivity in a Human Obese Population.
Gut microbiota, which acts collectively as a fully integrated organ in the host metabolism, can be shaped by long-term dietary interventions after a specific diet. The aim was to study the changes in microbiota after 1 year's consumption of a Mediterranean diet (Med diet) or a low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet (LFHCC diet) in an obese population. Participants were randomized to receive the Med diet (35% fat, 22% monounsaturated) and the LFHCC diet (28% fat, 12% monounsaturated). The study was conducted in 20 obese patients (men) within the Coronary Diet Intervention With Olive Oil and Cardiovascular Prevention (CORDIOPREV) study, an ongoing prospective, randomized, opened, controlled trial in patients with coronary heart disease. We evaluated the bacterial composition and its relationship with the whole fecal and plasma metabolome. The LFHCC diet increased the Prevotella and decreased the Roseburia genera, whereas the Med diet decreased the Prevotella and increased the Roseburia and Oscillospira genera (P = .028, .002, and .016, respectively). The abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis (P = .025) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P = .020) increased after long-term consumption of the Med diet and the LFHCC diet, respectively. The changes in the abundance of 7 of 572 metabolites found in feces, including mainly amino acid, peptide, and sphingolipid metabolism, could be linked to the changes in the gut microbiota. Our results suggest that long-term consumption of the Med and LFHCC diets exerts a protective effect on the development of type 2 diabetes by different specific changes in the gut microbiota, increasing the abundance of the Roseburia genus and F. prausnitzii, respectively.

The Arabidopsis arenosa complex is closely related to the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Species and subspecies in the complex are mainly biennial, predominantly outcrossing, herbaceous, and with a distribution range covering most parts of latitudes and the eastern reaches of Europe. In this study we present the first comprehensive evolutionary history of the A. arenosa species complex, covering its natural range, by using chromosome counts, nuclear AFLP data, and a maternally inherited marker from the chloroplast genome [trnL intron (trnL) and trnL/F intergenic spacer (trnL/F-IGS) of tRNALeu and tRNAPhe, respectively]. We unravel the broad-scale cytogeographic and phylogeographic patterns of diploids and tetraploids. Diploid cytotypes were exclusively found on the Balkan Peninsula and in the Carpathians while tetraploid cytotypes were found throughout the remaining distribution range of the A. arenosa complex. Three centers of genetic diversity were identified: the Balkan Peninsula, the Carpathians, and the unglaciated Eastern and Southeastern Alps. All three could have served as long-term refugia during Pleistocene climate oscillations. We hypothesize that the Western Carpathians were and still are the cradle of speciation within the A. arenosa complex due to the high species number and genetic diversity and the concurrence of both cytotypes there.

Like many kids who grew up in the ’70s, Simon Pegg was always a fan of Star Trek. But he never imagined that one day, he would get to play a main character and act alongside one of his idols.

Simon Pegg landed the role of a lifetime when he became the new Scotty in the latest Star Trek series. But for the actor, his memories of Star Trek as a child were much different from those that others had. Pegg told MTV that he became a fan as a young boy, but not by watching the original series with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy.

The British actor said he learned to love the story through an animated series in the 1970s that came out after the original show ended.

“I was watching that before I saw the live-action show in the very early ’70s and then watching the original TV show in ’78 or ’79 when I was on holiday. BBC2 used to show it at 6 o’clock every night, so I’d watch it while I had my dinner,” Pegg said. “I used to just love it because it was this strange, odd, kind of thoughtful show that was all about sci-fi, which I love. I have very strong memories of it as a child.”

That inspired child grew up to be a successful actor and filmmaker, but nothing could compare to meeting one of his childhood heroes. Pegg was one of the only Spock fans who got to meet the actual character.

“What was weird was actually getting to act with Leonard Nimoy and acting with a character that I’ve known since I was a kid, not just the actor, but the character,” he said. “When Spock spoke to me as Spock, it was mind blowing.”

Pegg’s film The World’s End is in theaters now. He teamed up with actors he has worked with on many of his other films, including Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead.

The World’s End is about childhood friends getting older and going home again. Pegg said it came at the right time, and he is glad they waited to make the film they have been thinking about for years.

“I don’t think we could have made the film when we had the idea, because we needed another six years of living in order to say what we wanted to say,” he told The New York Times back in August.

The World’s End has already pulled in nearly $40 million worldwide. Star Trek Into Darkness is now available on Blu-ray and DVD.

"Mortal man," he said, "denounce the rulers of Israel. Prophesy to them, and tell them what I, the Sovereign Lord, say to them: You are doomed, you shepherds of Israel! You take care of yourselves, but never tend the sheep.

3
You drink the milk, wear clothes made from the wool, and kill and eat the finest sheep. But you never tend the sheep.

4
You have not taken care of the weak ones, healed the ones that are sick, bandaged the ones that are hurt, brought back the ones that wandered off, or looked for the ones that were lost. Instead, you treated them cruelly.

5
Because the sheep had no shepherd, they were scattered, and wild animals killed and ate them. 1

6
So my sheep wandered over the high hills and the mountains. They were scattered over the face of the earth, and no one looked for them or tried to find them.

7
"Now, you shepherds, listen to what I, the Lord, am telling you.

8
As surely as I am the living God, you had better listen to me. My sheep have been attacked by wild animals that killed and ate them because there was no shepherd. My shepherds did not try to find the sheep. They were taking care of themselves and not the sheep.

9
So listen to me, you shepherds.

10
I, the Sovereign Lord, declare that I am your enemy. I will take my sheep away from you and never again let you be their shepherds; never again will I let you take care only of yourselves. I will rescue my sheep from you and not let you eat them.

11
"I, the Sovereign Lord, tell you that I myself will look for my sheep and take care of them

12
in the same way as shepherds take care of their sheep that were scattered and are brought together again. I will bring them back from all the places where they were scattered on that dark, disastrous day.

13
I will take them out of foreign countries, gather them together, and bring them back to their own land. I will lead them back to the mountains and the streams of Israel and will feed them in pleasant pastures.

14
I will let them graze in safety in the mountain meadows and the valleys and in all the green pastures of the land of Israel.

15
I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will find them a place to rest. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken.

16
"I will look for those that are lost, bring back those that wander off, bandage those that are hurt, and heal those that are sick; but those that are fat and strong I will destroy, because I am a shepherd who does what is right.

17
"Now then, my flock, I, the Sovereign Lord, tell you that I will judge each of you and separate the good from the bad, the sheep from the goats.

18
Some of you are not satisfied with eating the best grass; you even trample down what you don't eat! You drink the clear water and muddy what you don't drink!

19
My other sheep have to eat the grass you trample down and drink the water you muddy.

20
"So now, I, the Sovereign Lord, tell you that I will judge between you strong sheep and the weak sheep.

21
You pushed the sick ones aside and butted them away from the flock.

22
But I will rescue my sheep and not let them be mistreated any more. I will judge each of my sheep and separate the good from the bad.

23
I will give them a king like my servant David to be their one shepherd, and he will take care of them. 2

24
I, the Lord, will be their God, and a king like my servant David will be their ruler. I have spoken. 3

25
I will make a covenant with them that guarantees their security. I will get rid of all the dangerous animals in the land, so that my sheep can live safely in the fields and sleep in the forests.

26
"I will bless them and let them live around my sacred hill. There I will bless them with showers of rain when they need it.

27
The trees will bear fruit, the fields will produce crops, and everyone will live in safety on his own land. When I break my people's chains and set them free from those who made them slaves, then they will know that I am the Lord.

28
The heathen nations will not plunder them any more, and the wild animals will not kill and eat them. They will live in safety, and no one will terrify them.

29
I will give them fertile fields and put an end to hunger in the land. The other nations will not sneer at them any more.

30
Everyone will know that I protect Israel and that they are my people. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken.

31
"You, my sheep, the flock that I feed, are my people, and I am your God," says the Sovereign Lord.

Café Yumm!

Café Yumm! is a fast casual restaurant chain with outlets in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.

Founded in Eugene, Oregon, Café Yumm! outlets focus on fast, casual, cheap, and healthy cuisine, and some menu items feature the company's original signature sauce.

History
Café Yumm! was founded in 1997 when owners Mary Ann and Mark Beauchamp converted their unsuccessful juice bar into a fast casual restaurant. Central to the new menu were the Yumm! Bowl and its Yumm! Sauce, both developed earlier by Mary Ann Beauchamp at her former restaurant, Wild Rose Café & Deli. The company opened a second location in Eugene in 1999 and a third in 2002, and in 2007 the company began to franchise. The chain grew to 15 locations by 2015, with two franchises in Bend, Oregon. 

The chain opened its 23rd location in Eagle, Idaho, in February, 2019, as part of a three-outlet plan that includes two future Boise locations.

Estimated annual revenue for the company is $10.1 million with an estimate of 54 employees.

Menu
The Café Yumm! menu consists of five categories: three sizes of rice bowls layered with organic beans, Yumm! Sauce, and Deluxe Toppings (shredded Tillamook® cheddar cheese, tomatoes, avocado, sour cream, black olives, and cilantro), sandwiches and wraps, salads, soups, and bentos. More than 50 percent of the food served at Café Yumm! restaurants is certified organic.

Yumm! Sauce 
Café Yumm! co-founder Mary Ann Beauchamp developed the recipe for Yumm! Sauce in the 1980's. The company's original signature sauce is made with a base of almonds, garbanzo beans, soy beans, lemon juice, oil, herbs, and nutritional yeast. The sauce is used on a variety of menu items at Café Yumm! restaurants and a commercial version of the sauce is sold in over 160 grocery stores throughout the Pacific Northwest and through the company's online store.

Reception and Awards

Café Yumm! has been named The Register-Guard's Readers’ Choice for "Best Lunch Bargain" and "Favorite Vegetarian" in readers' polls many times since 2009. The company was also recognized as "Most Environmentally Friendly Business" in 2009. Café Yumm! has been named in the Eugene Weekly's "Best Of" for a variety of awards including "Best Vegetarian", "Best Eats Under $8", and "Best Cheap Eats" from 2014 to 2018. 

QSR Magazine included Café Yumm! in the 2018 40/40 List of America's Hottest Startup Fast Casuals.

The basic hypothesis of this proposal is that the ability of alpha adrenergic agonists to stimulate the Na+ pump of vascular smooth muscle may be related to the activation of Na+ influx and/or intracellular Ca++ release which are alpha1-mediated events or the influx of extracellular Ca++ which is an alpha2-mediated event. The project will be aimed at investigating this hypothesis in both quiescent and proliferating cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. These culture systems may serve as a model of normal, differentiated vascular cells (quiescent) or as a model of certain disease states such as atherosclerosis or hypertension in which cells are proliferating. Cells maintained under quiescent or proliferating conditions will be characterized with respect to Na+ pump number by quantitating [3H]-ouabain binding, turnover rate of the Na+ pump by measuring ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake and numbers of alpha1 and alpha2 receptors by [3H]-prazosin and [3H]-yohimbine binding. After control values for each of these parameters have been determined, the short-term effects of selective alpha1 and alpha2 agonists and antagonists on Na+ pump rate will be monitored. The role of a particular receptor subtype or subtypes will be assesed by comparison of relative potencies of selective agonists and pA2 values of selective antagonists. A primary effect of alpha agonists in all cells possessing alpha receptors is the mobilization of extracellular or intracellular Ca++. Experiments will be performed to determine the role of Ca++ in alpha-mediated stimulation of the Na+ pump by manipulating these pools of Ca++ and observing the effects on alpha-mediated pump stimulation. An alternative mechanism may be an alpha-stimulated Na+ influx related to the activation of a membrane Na+-H+ exchanger. This possibility will be investigated by measuring changes in [Na+]i by flame photometry and [pH]i by uptake of the weak acid [14C]-DMO in the presence of selective alpha agonists and antagonists. It is also planned to assess the effect on Na+ pump parameters of long term incubations of vascular smooth muscle cells with alpha agonists. In addition, alpha receptor number will also be monitored. It is expected that significant data will be obtained regarding the control of active and passive ion movements in vascular smooth muscle. In view of the role that disturbances of ionic regulation are believed to play in hypertension, it is anticipated that these studies may contribute to the understanding of this disease process.

I've got Mongolia on my mind too.. I've spent 12 years living and studying in the US. Now I come to the conclusion that I should go back to Mongolia and contribute to its development through what I have learned in American schools. However, I am anxious about going back. One of the major fears that I have about going back is that there is a system in Mongolia that does not value academic and professional merit but promotes the power of connections and "buying" job posts. What would you advise to those like me who are contemplating a return to our homeland and pursue professional careers there? Thank you.

Joey Rosskopf (BMC Racing) won his second straight time trial title at the USA Cycling Pro Road Championships on Thursday in Knoxville, Tennessee.. The 28-year-old was strong throughout course, three laps of an 11.4-kilometer circuit totaling 34.2 kilometers. He set the fastest times at the early checkpoints and held on to finish with the day’s fastest mark of 39:46.. Sunweb’s Chad Haga finished second, 28 seconds down.. “I couldn’t have asked for better legs. It was pretty hard to match Chad Haga’s time on the first lap especially,” Rosskopf said. “I felt like I had the advantage to know the time checks, to base my own ride off of them. The only option to win is to go out and match the times and do better. If you fade, at least you tried. Luckily I felt good enough to do that.”. Brent Bookwalter gave BMC a third podium finisher, 34 seconds back.. Aevolo Cycling’s Gage Hecht delivered the fifth fastest time, two minutes down on Rosskopf, to finish as the day’s best-placed under-23 rider.

I.). Bueno, welcome to my new design! Hopefully, you’ll get to like it as I have. I based it on the theme called "Identity". The original, however, wasn’t fully compatible with WP2.5 — and it looked rather plain as is — so I had had to do some major recoding on the templates.. I did love my old theme very much ("Subtle for WordPress" by GluedIdeas), so here’s a tribute to it: a screen-capture of the blog just before I started upgrading WordPress and installing & tweaking the new theme.. Congrats Kuya Blogie.. Anyway, check out your screenshot’s MyBlogLog widget; I’m your latest visitor!. Hahaha.. Thanks, Mikko!. @Mikko – di ah.. ako ang latest.. check mo ulit.. hehe. ay sa screenshot pala. sorry ^_^

Epic are releasing a massive update to Fortnite’s Battle Royale map, splitting it up into different biomes and adding new types of play spaces, such as multi-story buildings and labyrinthine tunnel networks.

The map update is coming this week, but Epic can’t say which exact day it will arrive yet.

You can see some footage of the updated map in the developer diary posted last week:

Epic launched Fortnite’s Battle Royale mode back in September with a map the team knew they could improve. “One of the things we wanted to do to make it better was to add more points of interest to the map,” lead level designer David Spalinski tells me. “Points of interest act as areas for players to congregate and meet and fight over various weapons and other types of valuable loot. They’re also an opportunity to add unique elements of gameplay, specific to that particular point of interest.”

Spalinski isn’t talking about adding in new systems and mechanics, but how spaces themselves can drive different kinds of play. “We have a new point of interest called Tilted Towers that is a city area, [which adds] a unique style of gameplay by having taller buildings and a higher density of locations. Each building is kind of like a labyrinth and they’re all close to each other.”

Another lead level designer, Sidney Rauchberger, points to a new area called Shifty Shafts that “adds a contrasting kind of gameplay.” Rauchberger explains that is “essentially an underground mine. It’s very windy, it’s got a lot of close quarters, tight angles, it’s darker. It’s frantic.”

These new kinds of spaces will infuse the Battle Royale mode with a greater variety of play and, considering the way the map closes down as the circle of death shrinks, this can significantly affect how the late-game plays out. “Because the circle is going to determine where you will end,” Rauchberger says, “you’re going to be pushed into some interesting scenarios that will force you to adapt your style of play – games ending in the maze are going to be very tense.”

The new biomes, which see the map split into swamp, grasslands, farms, and mountains, aren’t just to give more visual variety, but also to give players the tools to better orientate themselves.

“You start to gain a little bit of memory,” Spalinski says, “like ‘Oh, I’m in the mountain area, that means I’m on the western side of the map’, or ‘I’m in the swamp areas, that means I’m on the southern side of the map’. It helps give you a sense of place.”

The team also took the opportunity to redress the current points of interest on the map. “A lot of that refreshing came from playing the game with the community, listening to their feedback, reading on the internet what people had to say about certain areas that they may love or hate,” Spalinski says. “People like to go to certain areas a lot of times or stay away from others, and we like to see why that is and try to make them a little it better.”

With that feedback in mind the team made minor adjustments to a number of locations, making them more appealing. “It could be as small as ‘Hey, this area doesn’t have enough ammo, it would be great if I didn’t have to leave it to keep fighting other people’. We listened to that kind of feedback and looked at and balanced the areas so they’re creating the kind of gameplay that our users desire.”

Epic say the update is only possible because of improvements they’ve made to how the engine streams in content. “Before we had to fit everything in at once,” Rauchberger says, “now we’re able to allocate more resources because we’re able to split up the world better.”

It also means that there is the possibility that Epic will do a similar scale of update to the map in the future. “We’re always trying to see if there’s space to continue to improve,” Spalinski says. “When we released initially, internally, we felt without our new streaming technology that there were certain things we were incapable of doing […] and there were certain things we didn’t know needed to be done until it was out there […] and the community had played it and it was just going to take a little it of time to collect the things we didn’t know.

“This map update addresses some of the things that we wanted to do and some of things we learned along the way. We’re most likely going to be able to repeat that process of learning about what we’re about to release and where the opportunities as a result of that and the community will be able to inform us to some degree.”

Sober Blood

Twenty-two years for a plastic chip
That says how long ago I quit
Don’t tell the truth that’ll never change
I still want to everyday

I gave up what was once my life
A family–my kids, my wife
And don’t you know not a day goes by
When I ain’t trying to make it right

If I’d only known all of the things that I know now
I can’t help but wonder how my life would have turned out
I might die alone although the papers may not show
That the sober blood of a good man is gone

I ain’t missed one of them meetings since
The day that I signed up for this
But the lessons learned won’t ever heal the pain
Of a family still suffering

On my knees, I ask the Lord
Questions that He’s heard before
Just what can I do for forgiveness now?
I ask of You this final hour

If I’d only known all of the things that I know now
I can’t help but wonder how my life would have turned out
I might die alone although the papers may not show
That the sober blood of a good man is gone

Here I stand at Heaven’s doors
Wondering why, not really sure
Then I hear a voice calling out my name
I guess it’s true that Jesus saves

If I’d only known all of the things that I know now
I can’t help but wonder how my life would have turned out
I might die alone although the papers may not show
That the sober blood of a good man is gone

Robert Kugler, with Bella

Robert Kugler, with Bella

Cruising through the streets of Philadelphia and exploring the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.

Rolling around a park in Cleveland.

Watching the water flow at Niagara Falls.

Standing atop a rock in the Adirondack Mountains in New York.

Hanging out at Harvard; chilling in front of Boston's Fenway Park.

It was the worst possible news you could get about your best buddy.

Bone cancer, so a leg is amputated. But it gets worse. The cancer’s spread to the lungs. Now it’s a terminal condition.

So what do you do?

Robert Kugler decide to take his best friend — a three-legged chocolate lab named Bella — on one last, legendary ride.

“This is one of the biggest connections I’ve ever had to another living being. I don’t care that it’s a dog,” said Kugler, who’s from Broken Bow, Nebraska.

A devastating diagnosis

Kugler found out last year that Bella was dying of cancer. He had adopted her as a puppy nine years ago and wasn’t anyway ready to let her go.

“I just didn’t want her to be gone one day when I came home,” he said.

So Kugler began with Bella a trip of a lifetime. Kugler’s a Marine vet, so they headed off to Chicago back in November to the Marine Corps Ball.

His social media feeds — Twitter, Facebook and Instagram — documented their travels as they headed from there to points east and south:

Bella posing in front of a mural in Detroit

getting petted by some Salvation Army bell ringers in Bowling Green, Kentucky

checking out the sunset over Lake Erie

rolling around a park in Cleveland

Watching the water flow at Niagara Falls

standing atop a rock in the Adirondack Mountains in New York

hanging out at Harvard; chilling in front of Boston’s Fenway Park

cruising through the streets of Philadelphia and exploring the Lincoln Memorial in Washington

Bella and Kugler have either camped out in his Toyota 4Runner or couch-surfed with his friends along the way. Kugler’s doing this trip, not just for Bella, but for others too.

“I want to inspire people to get outside and live,” he said. “Love each other for who we are and make friends.”

They’re now in Florida, on the Gulf coast side, enjoying St. Petersburg and the white sand beach in Siesta Key. Well, not totally enjoying them, since the Sunshine State’s intense heat is pretty rough on Bella.

“The cold is easier to combat with a dog than the heat,” Kugler joked. He says the waters are so warm in Florida right now that they’re not exactly “refreshing” to her.

So now Kugler’s thinking of heading west, stopping for a bit back home in Nebraska before introducing Bella to the nation’s majestic national parks, like Yellowstone and Yosemite. He hasn’t really planned it out with too much detail. And that’s part of the charm of this long goodbye.

“Continuing to move and see the country is a good excuse to spend time with my dog,” he said. Being spontaneous can sometimes be a headache, since it means spending a huge amount of time “figuring out where we’re going to sleep,” but it also means enjoying unplanned little adventures.

“You come across a little gravel road and wonder, ‘where does this go?'” So you make the turn and find out, Kugler said.

The greatest gift

Doctors gave Bella just six three to six months left to live last year; she’s survived much longer than that, but Kugler knows Bella’s time is drawing short. He said a few weeks ago, he watched her, playing in the waters on a beach and envisioned a peaceful end for her.

“Some days I’m completely prepared. I pictured her just swimming out to sea,” he said. “But there’s other days when I’m like, oh my God, I can’t bear the thought of it.”

But whenever and wherever it happens, he’ll be with her. It’s part of the job of being best buds with a dog.

“We take on these animals, which means we’re gonna take on their life and their passing,” Kugler said. “To be there with them when they pass is the greatest gift you can give anybody.”

When Bella’s gone Kugler said he’ll volunteer more, like he has in the past for organizations that help veterans, like Team Rubicon and Team Red, White & Blue. And yes, he’ll continue to hit the open road.

“I want the freedom to travel. I don’t want a home that’ll keep me in one spot.”

Until then, Kugler thinks we should all be a little more like Bella: “Wag more; bark less.”

My work stems from process. I enjoy learning new techniques and manipulating them in new ways. I work on a broad range of projects including clothing, upholstery, restoration, jewellery, painting and sculpture. I find that by keeping my practice broad different ideas feed into each other to produce more interesting results.. I also aim to make my work as sustainable as possible. I want my products to be cherished and cared for and to make people feel happy. I feel that texture and attention to detail play a part in this as they help people to feel connected to an object. Quality is also a major factor in the life span of a product so I try to ensure the best workmanship in all that I make.. I grew up on Telegraph Hill and I enjoy the chance to take part in community projects such as the Hill Station.

Tasting Notes. Opici Homemade Style Barberone White is a full bodied wine made from a blend of white grapes. The wine has a full, slightly sweet floral aroma.

The Lawi overshoes made from lycra provide the cyclist with an aerodynamic advantage. The overshoes are very light weighted and due to the used fabrics, the shoe cover fits perfectly around your cycling shoe. On the underside of the product, a recess is applied to let the heel and the cleat come out of the overshoe.. In addition, to provide an aerodynamic advantage, the product also protects your cycling shoes against dirt. This is ideal for mountain biking or cycling during bad weather conditions. The product is therefore easy to wash out.

. Step over the stile into a world that no one knows exists. A world that overturns everything you know about the goodness of people and creates a mirror image of evil. Five years about I found this true story haunting, today I find it just as compelling. What you will see is the worst catastrophe you can imagine. When a young girl comes into a police station and claims her father is having sex with her, the authorities have no idea how big this situation is and how pervasive it is in the culture of a group of people that call themselves the Goler Clan. And it is not just a single act on one person but a whole series of crimes committed generation to generation. Truly there is no explanation that can be found, no escape from the depravity. The idyllic charm of the Annapolis Valley is penetrated by Evil so strong you can taste as you read. It enters your heart and mind never to let it go.

Construction News

A proposal to build a new 120-bed hospital in Albuquerque may be altered to allow for a smaller facility due to budgetary considerations.

After months of review and discussion, members of the University of New Mexico’s Board of Regents last summer agreed to let a project to build a new hospital advance to the design phase.

As proposed, the project would also include half a dozen operating rooms and clinical offices.

Initial plans additionally called for the hospital to be built on land owned by UNM just northeast of the University Boulevard and Lomas Boulevard intersection.

But now, some seven months after that vote, Dr. Paul Roth, UNM Health Sciences Center’s chancellor, has suggested a smaller facility may be more in order.

During a recent regents’ meeting, Roth said that although the need for more hospital beds remains unchanged, the university should conduct further studies before proceeding with what is anticipated to be a project that could cost as much as $250 million.

So far, the school has reserved some $200 million to build the hospital.

The project was earlier regarded as only the first phase in the eventual construction of a $684 million hospital with just over 400 beds.

UNM officials have long maintained that a new hospital is especially needed not just because it would provide more bed space, but also because the current structure built in the 1950s is no longer adequate for the hospital’s needs.

Telomere length and its relationship with chronic diseases - new perspectives for periodontal research.
The ageing process is accompanied by a variety of cellular modifications, and telomere shortening is a common finding. Large epidemiological studies have reported an association between shorter telomere length in peripheral leukocytes and several inflammatory diseases of the elderly including diabetes, atherosclerosis and, recently, periodontitis. The primary aim of this study was to critically discuss available evidence regarding the potential mechanisms relating shorter telomeres to periodontitis. A narrative literature review was performed to report evidence relating shorter telomeres to the ageing process and inflammation. Then, we searched MEDLINE (1950 to May 2012) and ISI WEB OF SCIENCE (1950 to May 2012) databases for the combination of the terms 'telomere' and 'periodontitis'. Although these associations suggest a possible role of telomere attrition in the onset or evolution of chronic inflammatory diseases, only two studies addressed the relationship between telomere length and periodontitis. We suggest that the chronic inflammatory burden observed in people with chronic periodontitis could represent the driver of telomere shortening. However, further evidence is needed to confirm whether inflammation is the cause or the consequence of the shorter leukocyte telomere length observed in people with periodontitis.

Pharmacokinetic changes of ipriflavone in rats with acute renal failure induced by uranyl nitrate.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of ipriflavone were compared after intravenous (20 mg/kg) and oral (200 mg/kg) administration in control rats and in rats with acute renal failure induced by uranyl nitrate (U-ARF rats). It was expected that the time-averaged nonrenal clearance (Cl(nr)) of ipriflavone in U-ARF rats could be significantly slower than in the control rats, since it was reported that ipriflavone was metabolized via the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1/2 and 2C11 and the expression and mRNA level of CYP1A2 were not changed, but those of CYP2C11 were decreased in U-ARF rats compared with control rats. Unexpectedly, after intravenous administration in U-ARF rats, the Cl(nr) of ipriflavone was significantly faster than in the controls (40.8 compared with 29.0 ml/min/kg). This may be due to an increase in the glucuronide conjugate formation of ipriflavone metabolites in U-ARF rats. After oral administration of ipriflavone in U-ARF rats, the AUC(0-24 h) was significantly smaller (194 compared with 295 microg min/ml) than in the controls.

Americans were voting in numbers unprecedented since women were given the franchise in 1920. Secretaries of state predicted turnouts approaching 90 percent in Virginia and Colorado and 80 percent or more in big states like Ohio, California, Texas, Missouri and Maryland.Though the exact numbers won't be determined until all the votes are counted in the next few days and weeks, a history-making high percentage of Americans voted, according to CNN and the Wall Street Journal:

More than 30 million voters had already cast ballots before Tuesday in early voting. Nearly 100 million more were expected on election day. Hundreds of thousands of voters waited from long before daybreak or for hours on end to make their choices known.

Michael McDonald, a politics professor at Virginia's George Mason University, predicted nearly 65% of the electorate would have voted by the time all polls closed -- matching or eclipsing the turnout in the presidential election of 1960 featuring candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Not since 1908, when the U.S. was convulsing through a shift from the machine party politics of the 19th century to the free-for-all of modern campaigns, has so large a proportion of Americans participated in a presidential election.

It was a good job! I'm glad you noticed. Maybe once you veer out of fantasyland you'll be able to see just how good a guy is that we just elected - smart, honest and articulate, all the things that the last President was not.

Grand Central Theatre. 33 Grand Central Terminal,. New York,. NY. 10017. 33 Grand Central Terminal,New York, NY 10017. 4 13 comments). Auditorium with 242 seats pictured in this 1937 trade report: Boxoffice. The April 1, 1937, issue of Motion Picture Daily said that the opening of the newsreel theater being built inside Grand Central Station had been set for May 3.. I passed by it many times but never went in. (In the early 1970’s, when I was going to college and Amtrak trains on the old New York Central lines were still leaving from Grand Central, I had to change stations in New York.) I distinctly recall that on one occasion, oe of the last times I saw the theater in operation, the program was the 1971 documentary “The Hellstrom Chronicle”, so the end must have come around 1973 or thereabouts.. Another thing: it probably was an inspiration for a strip in the comic series “Julis Knipl: Real Estate Photographer”, which takes place in such a theater.

New home, same life

New home, same life

My family and I finally moved into our house in the Diamond New Housing Scheme. I can’t say that I like it nor can I say I hate it. The traveling is hard and the morning traffic is harder but the place has a certain quietness to it that I like.

It’s been a long time since my mother, younger brother and I have shared a home together. At my age, I think I’ve spent too much time chasing life and chasing causes and not enough time seeing the people I love. A big part of loving people is witnessing their lives and caring about what you witness. I’ve been working on it.

And of course, I’ve got some interesting neighbours and naturally I’ve got that one neighbour that’s the epitome of jackassifiyishness. Almost every weekend they vibrate my windows with their huge music box while their battalion of children back-ball and juk the floor, the wall and each other. Sigh. I’m trying hard to mind my own business.

Just before the rain started this morning, I helped my mom wash. We used blue-soap, hard-brush and scrubbing-board. These days I look forward to washing with mom. I’ve seen her age these last few years and it forced me to accept that my time with her is not endless. Time is not endless for us.

I wait up for my brother at nights now and we do dumb things or watch pointless TV. I’m watching him become a man and I know that I won’t always be around to witness his life first hand. There’s no telling where life will take us. My mother’s eldest sister has lived in another country for most of their lives and they haven’t seen each other in years. One day, distance may stretch between my brother and I and we’ll fill that space with memories and Skype and annual visits.

This is also the first time in more than 15 years that I haven’t lived with Nani. She is there in her house and I am here in mine. Sometimes, it feels as if our worlds are not the same and never were and never could be but every now and then we meet and we laugh. Laughing makes everything better.

Life will never be perfect and happiness is not constant. But who wants that? Seriously, perfect and constant are predictable and boring.

Facial Implants. Bergen Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery in Hackensack, Westwood, Ridgewood NJ. Facial implants are used to enhance certain features of your face, including your cheeks or your jaw line. The surgery may be elective, or part of the reconstruction of the face due to an accident or illness, or needed as the result of prior surgery on the face. Through a facial implant, a maxillofacial surgeon can aesthetically improve facial contours.. Depending on your medical history and your overall objectives of this surgery — our doctors can recommend several courses of action. Surgery can be done with local anesthesia with an oral sedative to help you relax or general anesthesia which means you’ll be put to sleep. The length of surgery will depend on which part of your face is affected, but it commonly lasts between one to two hours. You may want to consider lower jaw, cheek or chin implants.. -.

(Reuters) - Hudbay Minerals on Tuesday vowed to appeal a court ruling that barred the Canadian miner from building a major copper mine in the United States after losing its bid to have a judge revisit the decision.

U.S. District Judge James Soto late on Monday said there was no basis to reconsider an earlier ruling that overturned approvals for the company’s contentious Rosemont project in southeastern Arizona, delivering a setback for Hudbay as it seeks to revive plans for the stalled $1.9 billion open-pit mine.

Hudbay’s director of investor relations, Candace Brule, said the company was disappointed with the decision and would proceed with an appeal as it studies next steps for the project.

“This ruling confirms that the court continues to misinterpret decades of precedent and the federal regulations and mining laws that govern the Rosemont project,” she said.

At issue is the validity of mining claims that would allow the company to dispose of mine waste on public lands adjacent to its operations.

The U.S. District Court for Arizona in July overturned approvals issued by the U.S. Forest Service for the mine, siding with environmental and tribal groups opposed to the plan.

Hudbay in August said it would appeal that ruling but it first asked the court to reconsider the decision on grounds it overstepped its authority.

However, Soto said there was no basis to reopen the case, according to a copy of the decision seen by Reuters. “Mere disagreement with a previous order is an insufficient basis for reconsideration,” the judge wrote.

Hudbay had planned to start construction of Rosemont by the end of this year, with first production expected by the end of 2022.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto says Texas' decision to deploy National Guard troops along the border is "unpleasant" and "reprehensible."

Last month's deployment had previously drawn Mexico's ire. It says the border should not be militarized and issues should be solved jointly.

In an interview with the newspaper El Universal published Friday, Pena Nieto said Texas' move could affect bilateral relations.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry has criticized border security and suggested last month that Islamic terrorists could be entering the U.S. from Mexico, a charge Mexico has dismissed as "absurd."

Texas says it needs to deploy National Guard troops to stop drug traffickers. The number of Central American migrants entering Texas also spiked earlier this year, but the flow has since declined.

NEWS. September 2013 High-Efficiency Ducted Steerprop Azimuth Propulsors for three vessels to be built in China. High-Efficiency Ducted Steerprop Azimuth Propulsors for three vessels to be built in China.. In late August and early September 2013, Steerprop Ltd. signed contracts with Chinese customers to deliver main propulsion azimuth propulsors for three offshore support vessels due to be built in China in 2014. All three vessels will be equipped with two 2000 kW SP 25 D Ducted Azimuth Propulsors. The propulsors will be delivered in mid-2014.. All of these propulsors will be equipped with the Steerprop HJ3 high efficiency nozzle. These high efficiency nozzles are hydrodynamically optimized to improve bollard pull without compromising free running efficiency. This combination of thrust and efficiency is sometimes very important in vessels that require both high bollard pull and efficiency such as Platform Support Vessels or other Offshore Support Vessels.

Q:

How do I find out which processes are causing the most disk activity?

I am hoping to find a way to do more performance monitoring--specifically, I hope that monitoring disk activity on a per-process basis will help me decide which programs are causing the most trouble (aside from the AV).   I'd rather avoid a shotgun approach.
For windows XP, is there a process monitor that can give me a solid idea of which processes are slowing me down by causing the most page faults, etc?  Thanks!

A:

Perhaps enabling the I/O reads and writes in the task manager (ctrl+shift+esc).  When looking at the processes in task manager select View then Select Columns.  Look for the I/O read optiona nd I/O write option and click them.  
This is what I get:

A:

While I prefer the accepted answer, there is another way with the existing task manager.

Task manager > Performance (tab) > Resource Monitor (button) > Disk (tab)

A:

I like the freeware Process Explorer.  It provides a bit more detail than the Windows Task Manager, including per-process I/O graphs.  Great for immediately spotting processes doing a lot of disk I/O.

Efficient infection from cDNA clones of cucumber mosaic cucumovirus RNAs in a new plasmid vector.
Full-length cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV) cDNAs were cloned into a new plasmid vector containing a modified plant virus promoter designed to transcribe the inserted sequence from its first nucleotide. cDNA copies of CMV strain Q (Q-CMV) genomic RNAs 1, 2 and 3 cloned into this vector were infectious when inoculated together, producing symptoms indistinguishable from those caused by wildtype Q-CMV infection. The infectivity of the clones could be substantially increased by excision of the viral insert together with the transcriptional promoter and terminator prior to inoculation. A diagnostic but silent mutation was introduced into the RNA 2 cDNA and found to be stably maintained in viral infection, allowing distinction of the recombinant virus from native contaminants. The infectious cDNA clones supported the replication of CMV satellite RNA when co-inoculated with biologically active Q-CMV satellite RNA transcripts. Using the infectious cDNAs described, it was found that a newly-identified overlapping gene (2b) encoded by Q-CMV RNA 2 was not essential for either systemic viral infection of Nicotiana glutinosa or replication of the satellite RNAs.

Jennifer Hinton at the Guardian:. The issue of austerity versus stimulus is often framed as the entire debate – if you don’t support one, you must support the other, because there are no alternatives. This is the same binary debate that has been going on for more than 100 years between the state versus the market. Yet, these dichotomies distract people from thinking about what’s really important – the goal of these policies, which is to grow the economy.. No analysis I’ve read thus far has questioned the damaging role that the endless quest for economic growth plays. Neither austerity nor government stimulus will ever be able to address the debt crises and recessions of the twenty-first century because what we’re dealing with here is an inherent contradiction of capitalism.

Q:

Was Michael Fassbender actually under the head for most of the movie?

In Frank (2014), the titular character Frank wears a big fake head for most of the movie. Is it Michael Fassbender who's under that head most of the movie? Or did he just act in the scenes in the last 15 min of the movie?

A:

I follow Jon Ronson (the writer of "Frank") on Twitter, and he has answered that question a few times, reporting that Fassbender did wear the mask all the time. There is a Q&A with the cast of the movie on the Collider website, and Michael Fassbender gives more details.

FASSBENDER: Yeah, I found it really liberating.  The only thing that
it took a bit of getting used to – or never really getting used to –
was when we were doing the performances, the sound in there.  You
know, I would go away and I was learning an accent and I’m practicing
it like this and then once you put the head on, there’s a reverb thing
that’s going on in there and it kind of puts the hearing off a little
bit, and it’s hard to sort of locate some stuff, but that was it.
The
rest was a lot of fun.  It was really cool.  It was like, as soon as I
put the head on it gave me an element of mischief.  It gives it sort
of the anarchic quality of Chris Sievey’s original Frank Sidebottom
character.  I think [he] really sort of came out in that.
And also,
it’s exactly what Lenny was saying.  For the other actors, it never
mattered that I couldn’t make eye contact really with other actors
because Frank is Frank and Frank lives in his own universe, and so I
was hoping for them, it would be the same.  Is he listening?  Is he
not listening?  Did he hear that?  They’re used to him anyway.  Except
for Domhnall’s character, which is a new introduction, everybody’s
used to Frank with the head on.  ‘Oh, that’s just Frank doing his
thing,’ or whatever it is.  Whether I was engaged or not engaged, both
times I think it was a help for me and hopefully for the other guys
that were responding to him.

And later, from the same interview:

FASSBENDER: It was hot and sweaty in there sometimes.  If you’re
running around in there, you can’t breathe as easy as you would
without it, but like I say, I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed having the head
on.  I actually wanted to bring it on to my next job.  They wouldn’t
let me.  [Laughs]

Although, they did have a second head for the stuntman. The only time Fassbender wasn't wearing it.

GLEESON: There’s another one for the stuntman that had little bits cut
out.  The one time it’s not Michael is when the guy gets knocked over
by the car.

This is why I find LORAC’s new $28 Ready, Set, Splash kit appealing…

That, and the quick-drying, waterproof formula.

The set’s four twist-up pencils come in colors that work well with most of my favorite summer eye looks.

Ultra Black, Navy, Charcoal and Jade will take you from poolside to dinner party in the blink of a cat eye, and when I want a smudgy vibe, I can just flip one over, and use the sponge tip on the back side.

From the left: Ultra Black, Charcoal, Jade and Navy

All of them are waterproof along the lash line. I just have to remember to keep my hands away from my eyes — no rubbing! Otherwise they start to disappear.

When I use these, I always try to remember to use short strokes, because they’re a little on the hard side. If I’m not careful, they’ll skip and look uneven.

If you’re hoping to wear these along your water line, you might want to pause (or as Tabs says, “paws”) first. I need from 3-4 layers to get the formula to really stick there, giving it about a minute between layers to dry.

Best for: Matte finish eye liner fans with a hankerin’ for a waterproof pencil to wear along their lash lines. And glide, these don’t, so you probably should be okay with harder textures.

Wow, love the colors! And like you said, I do love the look of the double color wing. All set to go and buy ’em, and then I noticed you said they “do not glide”, boo hop, I guess I’ll pass on these pretties after all.Allison recently posted … Guerlain Le Top Coat Gel: Manicure Savior?

6 Ways Monthly Meal Planning Can Save Money!

Have you tried Monthly Meal Planning? It can save you time, money, and your sanity, for real!

It’s the fifteen minute countdown for you to come up with an answer before you are sure to hear: “Mom! What’s for dinner?”

But, you haven’t had time to even think about dinner, much less plan for it and you know if you don’t come up with something fast – you’re going to be consumed by hungry little monsters… well, you know what I mean! lol

The next thing that pops in your mind… and theirs? Fast food… it’s just easier and faster, everyone will be happy and you won’t have to wash dishes after. But, stop and think: now you’re about to spend FOUR TIMES what it would have cost you to make a meal at home.

Let’s talk about how to fix this problem, save you money, and lower the stress of dinnertime.

Once you learn how to effectively meal plan you will become completely infatuated with MONTHLY meal planning! Weekly planning is great, but. monthly planning takes your stress levels down to an all time low! One more thing off your plate (no pun intended) means more time for other important things in your life.

Don’t be overwhelmed by the thought of becoming a monthly family meal planner! Even if you’re a weekly meal planner, all you’ll need is a couple hours, one day a month, to plan for the next month. Get out your planner, favorite recipes, and of course Pinterest, and start making your menu and grocery list.

You can also save a good amount of money with weekly planning. Once you give monthly planning a try you’ll be shocked that you can actually lower your grocery budget by as much as 50% and more!

Let’s look at these 6 ways monthly meal planning will save you even more money:

Skip The Drive Through

The very first thing monthly planning is going to eliminate is the urge to hit the drive through. Since you already know what you will be making for dinner each night, you already have the ingredients ready to go, it really is a no brainer!

Every time you buy fast food you’re spending about four times the cost of making your meal at home. That certainly adds up!

No Last Minute Store Runs

How many times have you been halfway through preparing dinner and realize that you are missing a key ingredient? Quickly you try to scramble up the kids (who are already hungry remember?) and make a run to the grocery store.

Not only is this super stressful, chances are you are not going to strictly buy that one ingredient you needed in the first place. It’s a little scary how the costs of a few extra items each time you are at the store add up. Monthly meal planning is going to drastically reduce the number of times you go to the store each month and as a result minimize this extra spending saving you even MORE.

Save That Gas

It’s simple. The less you have to drive your car the less gas you will use and the less money you will need to spend on gas. Once you start monthly meal planning you can save as much as over $100 each month on gas!

Making less last minute trips to the store and doing one large shopping trip at the beginning of the month are both ways you are going to save money on gas.

No Waste

You know what I mean, that moldy old produce in the back of the fridge. It’s enough to make you sick (in more ways than one) when you have to throw out food. That’s just like throwing money in the trash.

When you monthly meal plan there isn’t going to be any moldy veggies hiding in the crisper since you will only be buying exactly what you need. No more impulse buying because you think that you need an extra head of lettuce because maybe you will use it for a meal this week. No more throwing your money away!

No More Dinnertime Stress

Are you a stressful spender? You might not even realize it yet but you might be. When the last minute dinner stress sets in, you are bound to spend more money than necessary.

You will be amazed at how getting an entire month of meal planning out of the way is going to lower your stress levels and more than just at dinnertime! You will be freeing up more time in your week, and as a result you will have more time to think about all the other things that need your attention. You’ll be spending less money on groceries and gas meaning less stress paying the bills because you’ll have more to apply elsewhere. Monthly meal planning equals less stress!

Glasgow

This Scottish city is big on space and full of creativity.

Perched on the River Clyde is Scotland’s biggest city. Glasgow is actually the third largest city in the UK, with a population of 600,000 people. Here you’re walking through one of the Industrial Revolution’s pivotal districts. With a rich history in engineering, textiles and shipbuilding still evident wherever you wander.

Today, Glasgow is also famous for its arts and culture scene. With the School of Art, Zaha Hadid’s award-winning Riverside Museum, and Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum all making waves. Visitors also flock to Hampden Park for a taste of football history.

And with plenty of space and a curious population, it’s no surprise Glasgow has the nation’s second highest retail spend after London.

Scaramouche opened its doors on February 28, 2009 with the group exhibition, "The Practice of Joy Before Death; It just would not be a party without you" which brought together an eclectic and exciting group of artists living and working in the New York area.. The gallery is dedicated to the bold and enlightening journeys of both the emerging and established artist. Working in a variety of media, from the traditional to the more unusual and innovative, these artists explore contemporary reality through site-specific installation, with particular emphasis on conceptual and identity-based painting, photography, video and performance work.. It is Scaramouche’s mission to introduce artists from around the globe, often premiering their first U.S. solo exhibitions. In addition to showing the work of gallery artists, Scaramouche regularly produces group exhibitions comprised of diverse artists representing a broad range of work.

For as long as I can remember, sport, athletics and fitness have been an integral part of my life. From competing in track and field and soccer at an early age in Trinidad, and then moving onto baseball when I moved to Canada. In high school I joined the football and rugby teams,I remember and to this day still love the feeling that comes with competing. The validation of the practice, and hours alone spent training. The camaraderie amongst you and your teammates after a tough win, and tough losses. People often say that sports are a great tool for teaching life lessons. In my case they were a tool that i used to develop confidence, self awareness, and build life long friendships. It also taught me discipline, commitment, and accountability.

I really didn’t feel like doing this today. I’m in a bad mood for a fucking good reason. Hope everything sorts out.. But. It is the last day of March so here it fucking goes.. I’ve wanted this type of shorts/skirt dark blue with dots (stars) since last year, and I finally found it. Second-hand. I paid 25 kunas for it (4,50 $) but it is to big so I will have to do a little re-do with a sewing machine. No problem.. The shirt is sleeveless and I loooove the material. That was less than a dollar in a sale in textile house.. Sorry for all the “fuckings”, I can’t be in a good mood all the time.. Sometimes only the F-word will do 🙂. Hopefully you will have days ahead where the F-word will turn into an H-word (whatever is a “happy” word for you) 🙂

Duct Tape - a Doom 3 mod

Under the crazy presumption that a roll of duct tape has to exist somewhere on the Mars facility, the Duct Tape mod sticks flashlights to your machinegun and shotgun. In order to preserve the atmosphere, these new lights are much narrower (and a little brighter) than the standard flashlight, and are only available on the basic weapons. The pistol is not equipped with a flashlight, so as not to spoil the early sections of the game.

Download

A readme.txt within the archive contains installation instructions. Note that the file now contains files for both Doom3 1.3 and Doom3: Resurrection of Evil. For Doom3 1.3, copy the pak008.pk4 file into your /base folder, for Resurrection of Evil, copy the pak002.pk4 file into the appropriate folder (no idea what it's called as I don't have it). Be careful not to overwrite your existing /base/pak002.pk4 folder.

Misc/FAQ

Duct Tape was downloaded over 80,000 times in the first 24 hours of its release (not including downloads from the mirrors at various mod sites).

A toggle to turn the light on and off is coming. Perhaps.

The smaller cone is intentional (see above); if you want it as large as the flashlight, either use Duct Tape 0001 or replace lights/flashlight6.tga in pak005.pk4 with lights/flashlight5.tga from pak001.pk4

Not adding the flashlight to all the weapons is also intentional (see above).

The Doom3 SDK is not available - all you need to create mods like this is in the .pk4 files (use an unzip utility on them).

It's a mod - that it changes the game to something not intended by id is a given. Most find the game more fun using it, you may not.

Q:

Do NSArrays stay sorted when saved then retrieved from a plist

Simple question do NSArrays stay sorted when saved to a plist and then retrieved? 
I am having a sorting issue when i retrieve my array from my plist so i was curious.
I think it may also be a problem with this line. Do these maintain the order from titles followed the order of titleArr?
NSMutableArray *allTitles = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
[allTitles addObjectsFromArray:titles];
[allTitles addObjectsFromArray:titleArr];

How I save to plist
imageInfo = [[NSMutableArray array] init];

    NSMutableArray *Listing = [NSMutableArray array];
    [imageInfo addObject:Listing];

    NSDictionary *Images = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                            allTitles, kKeyTitle,
                            allMediaUrls, kKeyThumbUrl,
                            allWidths, kKeyThumbWidth,
                            allHeights, kKeyThumbHeight,
                            nil];
    [Listing addObject:Images];

    NSArray *sysPaths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory ,NSUserDomainMask, YES);

    NSString *documentsDirectory = [sysPaths objectAtIndex:0];

    NSString *filePath = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"image.plist"];

    NSLog(@"Plist File Path: %@", filePath);

    BOOL didWriteToFile = [imageInfo writeToFile:filePath atomically:YES];

    if (didWriteToFile) {
        NSLog(@"Write to .plist file is a SUCCESS!");
    } else {
        NSLog(@"Write to .plist file is a FAILURE!");
    }

A:

Yes if titles and titleArr are sorted than allTitles  will also be sorted. 
First all objects of titles will be added and than at all objects titleArr will be added as addObjectsFromArray method starts adding object array towards the end of receiving array.
Here is more info from Apple Docs

Adds the objects contained in another given array to the end of the
  receiving array’s content.

So yes plist  will have sorted array.

If you get a server of your own, it will work independently, so it will have its own Os and you could later install server side apps directly or script-driven sites via a hosting Control Panel. While keeping the Operating System updated is not always considered an absolute necessity, it can be a rather important task for a variety of reasons. A more modern OS version may have better support for certain hardware, so you could get better performance for the internet sites and web apps you install. Your server shall also be more secure since updates normally include security patches that resolve small problems which may enable unauthorized people to access your content. Last, but not least, more modern script versions, which are also released for both enhanced security and for additional features, may require a later version of the Os in order to work correctly and with their full capabilities.

Blazers. Blazers. The Blazers is one of the most versatile and wearable garments in a man’s wardrobe.

Justification of exclusion criteria was underreported in a review of cardiovascular trials.
Ethical guidelines for human subject research require that the burdens and benefits of participation be equally distributed. This study aimed to provide empirical data on exclusion of trial participants and reasons for this exclusion. As a secondary objective, we assessed to what extent exclusion affects generalizability of study results. Review of trials on secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. One hundred thirteen trials were identified, of which 112 reported exclusion criteria. One study justified the exclusion criteria applied. Ambiguous exclusion criteria due to the opinion of the physician (28 of 112 = 25%) or physical disability (12 of 112 = 11%) were reported. Within groups of trials that studied similar treatments (ie, beta-blocker, clopidogrel, or statin therapy), baseline characteristics differed among trials. For example, the proportion of women ranged between 23.1-47.4%, 2.1-38.9%, and 10.6-50.6% for the clopidogrel, beta-blocker, and statin trials, respectively. Nevertheless, no evidence was found for heterogeneity of treatment effects. Almost none of the articles justified the applied exclusion criteria. No evidence was found that inclusion of dissimilar participants affected generalizability. To allow for a normative discussion on equitable selection of study populations, researchers should not only report exclusion criteria but also the reasons for using these criteria.

Q:

Removing emails from all mailboxes with certain text in subject

So, we had an errant program kick off about 15,000 emails to our users.  I have our spam filters now blocking these on the edge until that gets resolved, but now I would like to clean our our users' mailboxes for them.  Is there anyway with Exchange 2007 to remove all emails with certain text in the subject line?  It would need to be a partial match because the subject changes slightly for each email.
I am trying to do this with Forefront's manual scan job + content filter, but it does not seem to like partial matches on the subject.

I haven't used it myself, but the export-mailbox PowerShell command should be what you need using the -Deletecontent option along with the -SubjectKeywords option.  Here's the link from MSDN on export-mailbox.  I also found this blog post with some good information.

The present invention relates to a handheld spraying device adapted for at-home kitchen use and, more particularly, to such a device employing a quick disconnect feature that allows the user to replace the spraying mechanism with mechanisms of different shapes, sizes and spraying features without having to replace the connecting hose assembly.
Handheld spraying devices are becoming increasingly popular for in-home kitchen use for a variety of applications ranging from dishwashing to the spraying of vegetables. For different applications, different nozzle sizes and shapes and spraying patterns are preferred. While a variety of quick disconnect mechanisms have heretofore been developed to permit quick and easy disassembly of a spray nozzle for cleaning or replacement, such mechanisms are often relatively complicated and thus are relatively expensive to manufacture and difficult to use and/or require the use of separate tools. As a result, such devices have not met with widespread acceptance. It would be highly desirable if a disconnect assembly could  be incorporated into a handheld spraying device that was of simple construction, inexpensive to manufacture and could be easily utilized to change the spraying mechanism without having to replace the connecting hose assembly and without the need for tools or complicated multi-step procedures to provide a plurality of spray features for different applications. The present invention provides such an assembly.

Intermountain Healthcare Teams with GE Healthcare in Effort to Reduce Patients' CT Radiation Dose by up to 50 Percent

Salt Lake City–Intermountain Healthcare today announced a joint effort with GE Healthcare to help further reduce radiation dose in Computed Tomography (CT) procedures at its facilities by up to 50 percent*. Intermountain and GE Healthcare will collaborate to further reduce patients' radiation dose through the GE Blueprint for low dose, a comprehensive solution combining technology, people and processes. The GE Blueprint program will include a special focus on reducing radiation during pediatric imaging procedures, and was announced today at Intermountain's Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City.

CT imaging is a critical tool in helping physicians diagnose disease and has positively impacted millions of adults and children. Through collaboration with GE Healthcare and implementation of innovative imaging technologies and system-specific solutions, Intermountain will continue to lead in further reducing radiation dose while maintaining exceptional image quality in diagnostic procedures. The program will include a focus on the unique needs of pediatric patients, leveraging technologies and protocols to help doctors match body size and type to appropriate scans.

"Ensuring high quality images at the lowest possible radiation dose is a priority in every diagnostic imaging procedure at Intermountain, including an emphasis on the specific needs of children in our care," said Dr. Keith White, medical director of Imaging Services for Intermountain Healthcare. "Through our work with GE Healthcare, we continue to invest in the very latest solutions to optimize imaging, delivering the highest standards of care to all patients."

"GE Healthcare has long been committed to working with health care providers, including the nation's leading hospitals, to help them continuously reduce radiation dose in CT imaging," said Steve Gray, vice president and general manager of CT & Advantage Workstation for GE Healthcare. "We look forward to collaborating with clinical leaders at Intermountain Healthcare and building upon GE's announcement last year of more than $800 million of investment in low-dose technologies over 15 years."

Traditionally in CT, high-image quality often required greater patient exposure to diagnostic radiation, and conversely, lower dose levels for the patient usually meant lower image clarity. Over the last four decades, CT technology and processes have evolved. Together with GE Healthcare, Intermountain is helping change the equation by continuing to lower radiation dose while maintaining diagnostic image quality - in adult as well as pediatric imaging.

* GE Blueprint's goal is to work with healthcare providers to reduce their average patient exposure by up to 50 percent, based on longitudinal tracking of average dose. The dose reduction goal is the result of a comprehensive program covering a full array of dose reduction principles. It is not solely based on equipment features. Individual site achievement will vary and any percentage reduction is dependent on the initial baseline for that site. In all cases diagnostic image quality must be maintained.

Q:

Bash beginner: Edit value and add new values

I have a group of files (of varying line number) that always finish like this
[ molecules ]
; Compound        #mols
Protein_chain_A     1
SOL             12161

What I'd like to do using bash is subtract 2 from the value for SOL and add a new line like so within the file (the ideal would be with two tabs between the SOL and CL and their respective values)
SOL       12159
CL        2

I've tried bits and pieces with awk and sed but it keeps bugging on me. Would it be best to just use something else like Python?

A:

I would use the language I know the best (Perl in my case). But bash and its tools can serve you well, too:
{
    head -n-1 "$file"
    read sol num < <(tail -n1 "$file")
    echo $sol$'\t'$((num-2))
    echo CL$'\t'2
} > "$file".new

TEMECULA: City wrapping up review of wireless antenna plan

The city is getting ready to wrap up what has turned into a
monthslong review of Houston-based
Crown Castle
International's
plan to install a huge wireless antenna system
across a wide swath of Temecula.

Since March, the city Planning Commission has approved 35 of the
39 antennas that will make up the system, which initially will be
used by
MetroPCS
to enhance
its local coverage.

Many of the antennas, which are nodes in a grid that covers the
majority of the city's southern and eastern reaches, are light
poles with antennas attached to the side.

In areas where city residents didn't want extra light, they will
just be poles with antennas that look like stereo speakers attached
to the sides.

Stuart Fisk, city senior planner, said Friday that Crown Castle
is working with residents on placing the final four nodes and he
expects that the commission could consider the last batch in
November.

Illustrating the challenges Crown Castle has faced as it has
worked to find places for its nodes, Fisk said a resident who lives
near Crowne Hill Drive asked for a pole that had been approved to
be moved away from her home, to
Crowne Hill and Pauba Road.

The commission was set to look at that new location this week,
but the item was postponed because residents who live near the
corner were concerned about the antenna.

So it's back to the drawing board for Crown Castle, a company
that last year bought New Path Networks Inc. to boost its wireless
infrastructure business.

Fisk said some of the other issues to be worked out are
relatively minor. Crown Castle is working to secure permission to
use an existing wood utility pole in one location instead of
installing a new metal pole, and it is looking at moving a pole
near the clubhouse in the
Paseo
del Sol neighborhood.

As the commission has reviewed each of the nodes in the past few
months, it has heard from residents worried about radiation that
will be emitted from the devices.

The commission, however, cannot consider those types of concerns
when approving or denying the application because of federal law.
It can only rule on narrow issues such as aesthetics.

Other residents have asked why the city needs more wireless
coverage, especially in neighborhoods already wired by large
carriers.

Patrick Richardson, director of planning and redevelopment, has
responded by saying the city has to treat Crown Castle as a
utility, and utilities are allowed to use the public right of way
---- in this case, sidewalks and the like ---- to install
infrastructure for the public good.

As for how the city would handle applications by other companies
looking to follow in Crown Castle's path, Assistant City Attorney
Bill Curley said that the city would ask future companies to work
with existing infrastructure rather than build new poles.

Along those lines, Crown Castle reps have said that the system
will be able to handle additional carriers in the future, such as
AT&T, Verizon and Sprint.

Ceramide stimulates prostaglandin production by human amnion and decidual cells.
To determine whether ceramide regulates prostaglandin (PG) production by cultured human amnion cells and decidual cells independently of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Cells were grown in monolayer culture and then incubated with varying concentrations of ceramide, IL-1 beta, ceramide in the presence and absence of IL-1, and control media. Production of PGE2 was determined using a specific radioimmunoassay. Ceramide induced a significant concentration-dependent increase in PGE2 production by amnion cells and decidual cells. However, PGE2 production induced by IL-1 beta was significantly more than with ceramide alone, and there was no potentiation of PGE2 production with coincubation of ceramide and IL-1 beta. We suggest that term human amnion cells and decidual cells are responsive to ceramide independent of IL-1 beta and that generation of these substances in response to an infection in the uterus may lead to increased PG production by human gestational tissues, indicating that there are several mechanisms leading to PG production by these cells.

[Anti-tetanus vaccination after 3 cases of tetanus in a basic rural health area].
a) To find the prevalence of anti-tetanus vaccination in a health district, and b) to detect difficulties in the implementation of corrective measures, after the appearance of three cases of tetanus in 6 months. An observational descriptive crossover study. Primary care. Rural health district with 18266 inhabitants. People of both sexes over 14 from the 3 population nuclei, which had the best records of attendance and vaccination in the health district. Vaccination coverage at the start and end of the intervention for 328 people chosen by systematic randomised sampling. clinical records. At the start of the intervention there was less vaccination coverage among males, over-50s and people living in small nuclei of population. During the study period vaccination coverage increased more in the nuclei where there had been a tetanus case. Vaccines were lacking at the start of the intervention. A low use of clinical records in the health district was detected, which posed difficulties for the research. Except for one of the population nuclei, very few people at the start of the study were recorded as correctly vaccinated. It is seen that the health service responded slowly to such serious cases as these. It is suggested that primary health care activities should be programmed more in accord with the health problems prevailing in each area. With an illness like tetanus we should not wait for a case to occur before acting.

[Mycobacterium kansasii infection after liver transplantation].
Infections are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients because of treatment with immunosuppressive agents. Infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are infrequent but may be a major cause of morbidity. Treatment is associated with therapeutic limitations due to drug interactions with immunosuppressive agents and enhanced toxicity. Treatment of NTM infection most commonly involves surgery, reducing the doses of immunosuppressive medications and/or therapy with antimycobacterial medications The American Thoracic Society recommends isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol. The current duration for treatment of pulmonary disease caused by Mycobacterium kansasii is 18 months. We describe the case of an immunosuppressed liver transplant recipient with poor outcome due to acute cholangitis who also developed concomitant infection with an uncommon organism, M. kansasii, in the late posttransplantation period.

The survival of foot-and-mouth disease virus in raw and pasteurized milk and milk products.
The Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus (FMDV) is not a public health threat, but it is highly contagious to cloven-footed animals. The virus is shed into milk up to 33 h before there are apparent signs of the disease in dairy cows, and, in extreme cases, signs of disease may not appear for up to 14 d. During this time, raw milk can serve as a vector for spread of the disease both at the farm and during transport to the processing plant by milk tanker. Raw milk and milk products fed to animals have the potential to cause infection, but the potential for pasteurized milk products to cause infection is largely unknown. Current minimum pasteurization standards may not be adequate to eliminate FMDV in milk completely. The purpose of this paper is to assess the literature on the thermal resistance of FMDV in milk and milk products, to identify the risks associated with ingestion of pasteurized products by animals, and to lay a strategy to prevent the spread of FMDV from contaminated milk.

Hyundai says it will set a new standard for the lower end of the electric-vehicle market with its line of Ioniq EVs. The automaker says it will also launch an all-electric EV with a 200-mile range by 2018 and within two years of that will sell an EV with a range of 250 miles. The 2016 Hyundai Sonata PHEV plug-in hybrid is the brand’s first model to run on battery power alone, but the company promises much more to come. Hyundai has already said its Ioniq hybrid model would top the current industry leader, the Toyota Prius, in terms of efficiency. The Ioniq will be offered in three versions: a gas-electric hybrid; battery electric; and a plug-in hybrid.. Hyundai says that the new Ioniq (pictured) is just the beginning of electrification for the company. Next up is an entry-level battery electric with a 200-mile range, not unlike the current Chevrolet Bolt. (PHOTO: HYUNDAI)

Q:

Are expectation of with replacement and without replacement same? When?

I have $k_1$ red balls and $k_2$ green balls in a box. These balls are select by a uniform distribution. Randomly select $n$ balls from the box. Let $X$ be random variable that counts number of red ball after $n$ trails. What is expected number of red ball after $n$ trails if

These balls are uniform randomly select with replacement
These balls are uniform randomly select without replacement

Are these expectation similar? When?
This is what I did:
For with replacement case, I followed the answer at What is the probability that selects $i$ red ball and $n-i$ green ball, with replacement? and got the result as
$$E_1(X)=n \frac{k_1}{k_1+k_2}$$
In case of without replacement, I follow the Hypergeometric distribution 
$$E_2(X)=\sum_i^{k_1}  \frac{\binom{k_1}{i}\binom{k_2}{n-i}}{\binom{k_1+k_2}{n}} i$$
Thanks all 
This is MATLAB simulation for two cases. I saw that these expectation are same. Why?.
k1=8;k2=8;n=13;
%% With replacement
sum_E1=n*k1/(k1+k2);
%% Without replacement
sum_E2=0;
for i=0:k1
    if ((n-i>k2)|(n-i<0))
        continue;
    else
        sum_E2=sum_E2+i*nchoosek(k1,i)*nchoosek(k2,n-i)./nchoosek(k1+k2,n);
    end
end
sum_E1
sum_E2

A:

Actually, no, it is not a uniform distribution. I hope you found out that in case 1, $X$ follows a binomial distribution with $n$ trials, and $p = k_1/(k_1+k_2)$. You should be familiar with the fact that
$$E[X] = np.$$
Further, you seem to be familiar with the fact that in case 2, $X$ follows a hypergeometric distribution with $n$ trials, $N = k_1+k_2$ total balls, and $G = k_1$ red balls. You should be familiar with the fact that
$$E[X] = n\cdot \frac{G}{N}.$$
Notice that $n\cdot G/N = n\cdot k_1/(k_1+k_2) = np$. The most you can draw in case 2 are $k_1+k_2$ balls, so the two will be the same when $0\leq n\leq k_1+k_2$. Also, I assume that "These balls are select by a uniform distribution." means that you draw the balls fairly/impartially from the box, not that there is some underlying uniform distribution that is not revealed.

Or Kachlon could be the latest Israeli to attend the renowned Juilliard School of dance, drama and music in New York. The winner of last month's Born to Dance reality television series can now be found overseas auditioning for a spot in the school's Dance Division. The auditions in New York began on March 3 and ended yesterday. Among the Dance Division's alumni are the celebrated choreographers and dance company directors Lar Lubovitch, Paul Taylor, Bruce Marks, Susan Marshall, and Martha Clarke. While Kachlon found fame through his participation in the Channel 2 TV show, he made it known that his choosing to be a dancer was not easy socially. In Hadera, kids in his class called him the "gay nerd". The handsome 18-year-old was a favorite from day one of the contest. Although other reality TV winners, especially those from Born to Sing, have gone on to be local celebrities, Kachlon made it clear that he just wants to dance. In the coming days, we should know if Kachlon is headed to the top of the dance world.

Precious metals investment terms A to Z

CBOT (Chicago Board of Trade)

Chicago Board of Trade, established in 1848, is a commodity exchange and a designated contract market that offers traditional commodity and other financial instruments to traders, subject to the exchange rules and regulations.

In 2005, CBOT transformed from a non-profit organization to a for-profit organization with an IPO on the NYSE, listed as CBOT Holdings Inc. (Ticker: BOT). In 2007, the exchange merged with Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to form the CME Group. Now CBOT, along with CME, NYMEX and COMEX, operates as a designated contract market (DCM) of the CME Group.

Although the exchange dealt with only agricultural commodities in the initial days of establishment, now it offers options and futures contract on precious metals, energy and even U.S. Treasury bonds. The exchange was an open auction market for decades; however, it has added electronic futures trading facility in recent years. Enormous market volume in commodity related contracts ranks CBOT as one of the top exchanges in commodity space.

In the Salento countryside, shaped for centuries by olive trees, members of the Farmers’ Cooperative Agricola Nuova Generazione extract only the best parts from the olives using increasingly modern tools and methods that nonetheless respect past traditions. The experience of those who manage the various processing phases guarantees the quality of the products, which reach the market directly by means of leading transport companies without passing through intermediaries, which sometimes alters the products’ characteristics. In 2006, the Cooperative opened a factory for processing table olives, thus increasing the range of their product offerings. The farmers’ cooperative, established in Martano in 1979 by a group of 20 young farmers, currently comprises 1400 members to whom it tries to offer maximum profitability from the work and maximum productivity from the land with permanent employment in agriculture. In February 2010 the Cooperative carried out a merger and incorporated two other cooperatives, the Cooperativo di Corigliano D’Otranto oil mill and the Cantina Campi Latini di Seclì, thus expanding their product offerings with wines and becoming a food farming reference point for the Salento area. If you visit the farm from October to January, you can participate in the olive harvesting and pressing and you can take home the oil you make.

I’ve been extremely curious about Sweetpea & Fay’s J’Adore Les Levres liquid lipsticks for a while now–well over a year, actually–but I didn’t decided to order from them until this past Black Friday. I was initially intrigued by their sizeable line of colors, including unusual ones like blue and yellow. They usually sell for $9.99, but with the Black Friday sale I paid $5.99 for each. I ordered three colors:

Nordic, described on the site as “an opaque greyish blue matte shade”

Ukulele, described on the site as “a pastel pink/purple shade with a completely opaque look”

and Nantes, described on the site as “a stunning dark rose color with maroon undertones”

My natural lips:

Nordic:

Ukulele:

Nantes:

Arm swatches (Nantes, Ukulele, Nordic from top to bottom):

(All photos were taken in natural light with no editing.)

After swatching all of the colors on my lips, I feel like all of the descriptions are pretty accurate*. I do think that the site describing some of the shades as “opaque” is somewhat redundant, as all of the colors appear to be designed as opaque shades, but I can understand why they would want to restate it in lighter colors where natural lip color might show through. The lipsticks are very opaque and thick; while they are described as “liquid”, they wear more like a cream lipstick. The texture is very soft and doesn’t feel drying at all. Their staying power seems to be about the same as other lipsticks of similar textures: they’ll last a few hours if you’re not eating, but won’t hold up too well against greasier foods (I tested this with Trader Joe’s Mac n’ Cheese, which is delicious but not very lipstick-friendly). They are described as having “a soft french vanilla flavor,” which I find to be true, although they do still have a slight cosmetic scent underneath–they smell pleasant, but you can tell it’s a lipstick.

You really need to use a lip brush to apply these; if you try to apply straight from the tube, it would be very messy. Luckily, a lip brush is included in every order. You simply squeeze some product onto the brush, then begin in the center of the lower lip and spread outwards. I find these easy to work, particularly when compared to other liquid lipsticks, due to the more solid nature of the product. However, they do take more time than a traditional lipstick; each swatch took me about five minutes to get right.

Final verdict: 8/10 stars. I like the thick texture and opacity of the lipsticks, although I know that it isn’t going to be everyone’s cup of tea. I think that there are enough color options that everyone could find something that they would like, too. However, they can be untidy to apply (as seen in my lip swatch of Nantes) and I noticed that Nantes did stain my arm after the swatch, which should probably be expected of the darker colors in their line. *I would also like to note that the images on the site aren’t always representative of the actual colors, even though the descriptions are accurate. While my Nordic and Ukulele are pretty close to those shown on the site, my Nantes is noticeably darker than the site swatch. I would recommend looking around for swatches of specific colors on blogs if you’re considering buying.

Overall, I would repurchase these lipsticks.

Briefly, a cinemagraph may be described as a still photograph in which some repeated movement action occurs within a portion of a scene within the photograph. Cinemagraphs may be considered as something between a photograph and a video that seeks to capture a moment of action within an otherwise still photograph. In some aspects, a cinemagraph appears to the observer somewhat similar to an animated Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) image, a motion Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) image, or other video format. In these example motion images, a motion of some aspect of the image is perceived as a repeating or continued motion between images in the sequence of images.
While cinemagraphs provide for interesting animations, present approaches often require that the process of compositing the cinemagraph from a video sequence be performed manually using sometimes complex image editing software, often involving significant user interactions; and/or the use of tools which can only run on a personal computer or server, thus requiring the offloading of the captured video from the camera or mobile device to said computer—a burdensome and time consuming requirement. Many people may be reluctant to attempt to create cinemagraphs. Thus, there is a desire to provide improved mechanisms for creating of cinemagraphs, in a way which is both automatic and quick, providing the user with the result immediately on the camera without further intervention. Therefore, it is with respect to these considerations and others that the subject innovations have been made.

Dear readers,. I would like to create 15 Pdf's and 15 Mp3's for 15 different band instruments (Flute, Clarinet, Oboe, etc.) of "Row Row Row Your Boat" from one official version of sheet music.

Technology in the Classroom. Posted: Tue Jun 05, 2012 11:14 pm. As a future ESL teacher, I have come to realize that there is a huge shift in education to incorporate more technology into lessons and in the classroom. In my undergraduate education classes, I am required to include technology components into my lesson plans. I think it is important to find the right balance with how much technology you use in your lessons. I'm not sure how much technology would be considered too much, but you also want to make sure you use it enough to keep students engaged and are keeping up with the technology shift. What are some pros and cons with a constant use of technology? Also, what are some creative ways to use technology besides the standard PowerPoint presentation. I am new to the ESL field and don’t know how to be creative with technology. I also am concerned about cultural differences and students not knowing how to use certain technologies.

The later addition of a second sighting vane of another length, with a second scale calculated for it, provided a means to determine if the stave was in fact correctly placed relative to the eye by setting both vanes to the same angle marks on their respective scales and comparing them. But this could not actually be done during a sighting. A second problem was that the scale was not linear; the divisions are wide apart at low angles when the vane is well forward on the staff, but compacted when the vane is closer to the eye when high angles are being measured. These defects were inherent in the design of the instrument, and no later attempts at improvement could completely address them.

TOKYO — A former US nuclear regulator says cleaning up Japan’s wrecked Fukushima plant is a bigger challenge than the work he led at Three Mile Island and that ongoing radioactive water leaks are a minor part of that task.

Lake Barrett was appointed this month by plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. as an outside adviser for the decades-long decommissioning process. He led the Three Mile Island accident cleanup for nearly a decade as part of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

He said that the meltdowns in three of the reactors, massive radiation leaks, and the volume of contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, on Japan’s northeast coast, make it a more complicated cleanup.

‘‘In comparison to Three Mile Island, Fukushima is much more challenging, much more complex a job,’’ Barrett told a Tokyo news conference.

Compared to the magnitude of that task, the leakage problem is a ‘‘very low health impact and not a concern,’’ he told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview later Friday. The attention on the contaminated water leaks is ‘‘out of proportion,’’ and is hurting the overall cleanup process by slowing things down, he said.

The 1979 core melt accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania involved one reactor. All the radioactivity was contained in one building, where 8,000 tons of contaminated water were trapped.

In Fukushima, the catastrophe was precipitated by a massive earthquake and tsunami, whose aftermath are further adding to the difficulties of containing and cleaning up after the meltdowns of the three reactors. Moreover, buildings at the Japanese plant were destroyed or damaged by hydrogen explosions, which released massive radioactive elements into the air and sea.

But despite worries over the massive quantities of water needed to cool the reactors, the risk of radiation-contaminated water to public health is minimal, Barrett said.

Ringwood, Queensland

Ringwood is a locality in the Lockyer Valley Region, Queensland, Australia.

Geography 
Ringwood is located on the Warrego Highway which forms its southern boundary. The southern half of the locality is about 110–130 metres above sea level and is predominantly used for crops and grazing. The northern half is more rugged rising to an unnamed peak at 340 metres at the locality's north-western edge; this land is undeveloped bushland. The locality is almost entirely freehold land.

WASHINGTON — Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, could lose his seat to Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke because he is not likable enough, Office of Management and Budget Director suggested at a meeting of Republican National Committee donors in New York Saturday.

"Do people like you? That's a really important question," Mulvaney said, according to a person who was in the room. "What we have is a very real possibility we will win a race for Senate in Florida and lose a race in Texas for Senate. Ok. I don't think it's likely, but it's a possibility. How likable is the candidate? That still counts."

Some of his remarks were first reported by the New York Times on Saturday. Cruz's office did not immediately respond to NBC's request for comment.

"What we have is a very real possibility we will win a race for Senate in Florida and lose a race in Texas for Senate," Mulvaney told donors. "I don’t think it’s likely, but it’s a possibility. How likable is the candidate? That still counts.” Jacquelyn Martin / AP

Mulvaney, who did not use Cruz's name, was making a larger point that he believes the battle for control of Congress will be decided on a state-by-state and district-by-district level rather than the force of a political wave benefiting Democrats.

"Is this going to be the same thing for the Democrats as it was for the Republicans in 2010," when a Tea Party wave helped him win a House seat and gave Republicans control of the chamber. "I say this at the risk of giving the wrong answer to the question: the answer is no. It’s not."

Mulvaney said Democrats aren't bringing new voters into the process.

"It’s hard to bring new people in to a movement of hate," he said. "Anger doesn’t really attract people."

The other reason he doesn't see a wave, he said, is "we had a signature piece of legislation to run against. We had Obamacare. What is the signature piece of legislation that they’re against? The tax bill?"

Mulvaney said Republicans will win some races in which Democrats are favored and vice versa.

"What is going to be the distinguishing factor between those two outcomes?" he asked rhetorically. "Our candidates."

He pointed specifically to Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who lost a special election last year amid allegations of decades-old sexual misconduct.

"The president asks me all the time, why did Roy Moore lose?" he said. "That’s easy. He was a terrible candidate."

Blockbuster is losing big when it comes to at-home videos, so they are cutting back on expenses and on advertising in the U.S. to make up for it.. US same-store sales fell 15.9% in the 4Q and revenue dipped 18% to $1.08 billion compared to last year.. By closing its 500 weakest stores, the video-rental company hopes to reduce expenses by $200 million, the Financial Times reports.. Jim Keyes, chief executive officer, said the company was working with Rothschild, its financial advisors, on ways to increase its liquidity, including a possible recapitalisation.. Under Mr Keyes, Blockbuster is seeking to establish its brand in rapidly emerging new channels such as digital downloads and vending kiosks.. But they've already been beat to the punch. Netflix and Redbox dominate market share when it comes to digital downloads and vending kiosks, and Blockbuster will have a difficult time growing in those segments..

Patrick's pick for judge backs out. WBZ-AM. An Arlington attorney criticized for failing to disclose donations he made to two embattled politicians has withdrawn his candidacy to be a judge.. David Aptaker sent a letter to Gov. Deval Patrick Friday stating “an honest mistake on my part has become too much of a distraction in the approval process.”. Patrick had nominated him to be an associate justice of the Middlesex Family and Probate Court.. Aptaker donated $350 to former Middlesex Register of Probate John Buonomo and $200 to former state Sen. James Marzilli. Buonomo has since been convicted of theft and Marzilli resigned after being charged with sexual assault.. Judicial candidates are required to detail donations on a questionnaire.. The governor’s legal counsel, William “Mo” Cowan, says Patrick understands and respects Aptaker’s decision.

"`Feminism and Feminist Issues' is an anthology in which the ideas, observations
and perceptions of a set of esteemed authors are showcased in the form of research papers.
The papers deal with various aspects of feminism and feminist issues. Both feminism as
well as feminist issues are the topics of hot discussion in the global scenario. Wether in
an Indian village, across India, across the continent or across the globe, the status of
women remains the same. Woman is a vulnerable target for crime. The more of world tries
for empowering woman, the worse is her status in the world. It is quite shocking that
despite all the efforts by the Governments, NGOs and other organizations to ensure women
safely and to empower them, the rate of crime against women rockets up without any
restriction. Why? It remains as a puzzle. This anthology Feminism and Feminist Issues
deals with the status of women as it was, is and should be. It would be really an
eye-opener to all those who still keep an underestimated view about woman. It enlights the
readers with the innovative vision about woman and about how a society is expected to
treat its women. The esteemed authors of this anthology are from reputed institutions
across India. Their deliberations in this book give wider scope for aspiring youngsters to
explore deeper for effective research work."

Buried deep beneath the city’s main football stadium, the dance floor is an Olympic swimming pool (the DJs are at the deep end), Bassiani feels like the epitome of post-Soviet clubbing. It regularly attracts internationally famous artists, and has fostered its own line of Georgian DJs too (it even has its own record label). It's queer-friendly, dark and loud, though the place has some serious face control so don’t come in a suit. 2 Akaki Tsereteli Avenue

Diclofenac epolamine (Flector) patch: evidence for topical activity.
This review focuses on previously unpublished clinical and pharmacokinetic data with the diclofenac epolamine (diclofenac hydroxyethylpyrrolidine) patch supporting the hypothesis of a topical effect of this formulation. Previous studies have shown that 1 or 2 weeks of treatment with diclofenac epolamine provides pain relief for various localized musculoskeletal conditions such as ankle sprains, epicondylitis and knee osteoarthritis. The reduction in pain after application of the first patch in 155 patients with painful knee osteoarthritis was significant at the 1-hour time point and was superior to placebo at the 3-hour time point and at all time points thereafter. Comparable results were found in a study of 274 patients with acute ankle sprains, in which pain relief was also significantly superior to placebo at the 3-hour time point. Corresponding single-dose (patch) application for 12 hours in ten healthy volunteers demonstrated that diclofenac first appears in plasma at a mean of 4.5 hours after application (range 2-8 hours). Hence, the patch provided pain relief at a time point at which no diclofenac is assumed to be in plasma, which demonstrates local action in terms of tissue diclofenac accumulation under the patch. This is further supported by an apparent plasma diclofenac half-life of 9-12 hours after patch application, which implies the presence of a tissue reservoir, as the half-life after oral intake of diclofenac is 1-2 hours.Steady-state plasma diclofenac concentrations are present before 3 days' application (two patches/day) and are in the order of 1-3 ng/mL. The bioavailability in terms of systemic exposure from the patch compared with oral intake (75 mg/day) is in the order of 1%. Such low diclofenac concentrations are without systemic effects, as demonstrated by the fact that no drug-related gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers or cutaneous events characteristic of Steven-Johnson syndrome have been reported during 15 years of diclofenac epolamine patch use.These data provide support for the notion that diclofenac epolamine patch provides pain relief through accumulation of diclofenac under the site of application, without any evidence of systemic effects.

Quantitative shunt imaging in the evaluation of therapeutic surgery in a patient with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.
A case of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) in a 32-year-old woman who underwent successful left upper lobectomy is presented. A whole-body technetium-99m-labeled macro-aggregated albumin scan was used to demonstrate intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt, and shunt fraction was calculated as 39%. The patient underwent a follow-up scan after the operation; shunt fraction was calculated to be within normal limits (5%). The whole-body technetium-99m-labeled macro-aggregated albumin scan seems to be a simple and noninvasive test in the demonstration and quantitation of the degree of the right-to-left shunt in pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. The whole-body technetium-99m-labeled macro-aggregated albumin scan may also be useful for evaluation of the hemodynamic changes after surgical treatment and follow-up of the patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.

alloy article has a protective layer thereon, either in the form of an environmental coating or a the bond coat for a thermal barrier coating system. The protective layer has a high content of hafnium and/or zirconium to improve the adherence and properties of the protective layer. To introduce the hafnium and/or zirconium into the protective layer, the nickel-base alloy substrate, to which the protective layer is applied, is prepared with an initially elevated content of the hafnium and/or zirconium. A conventional bond coat is applied to the substrate. In an interdiffusion treatment performed during coating and/or subsequently, hafnium and/or zirconium diffuses from the substrate into the bond coat.

CA 125 in the management of endometriosis.
CA 125 is expressed by eutopic and ectopic endometrium. In women with advanced endometriosis, plasma concentrations are increased towards the end of the luteal phase and during menstruation but not during the follicular and early luteal phases. In women without endometriosis, such cyclic changes of CA 125 in plasma are not observed. In women with cystic ovarian endometriosis, plasma CA 125 concentrations are markedly elevated. Measurement of CA 125 in ovarian cyst fluid is the method of choice to differentiate a cystic corpus luteum from an ovarian endometriotic cyst, a frequent and difficult clinical problem. CA 125 can be used to diagnose deeply infiltrating endometriosis with a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 87%. These figures underestimate the clinical importance, since plasma CA 125 concentrations are mainly important for the diagnosis of deeply infiltrating endometriosis types II and III, which are the most severe forms and which are clinically easily missed. Because of the strong association of deep endometriosis and pelvic pain, the assay of CA 125 in plasma may be advocated in all women with unexplained pelvic pain as an aid in the diagnosis of deeply infiltrating endometriosis. Following surgical excision of endometriosis, CA 125 can be used to monitor the completeness of surgery.

It’s commonly found in curry. Curcumin occurs naturally in the spice turmeric and gives it that characteristic yellow color. People have been using curcumin in ancient Ayurvedic medicine for over 1000 years due to its wide-ranging health benefits. Curcumin is also commonly used in curries and cooking throughout Asia.. It’s safe to take. Unlike many modern medicines, the health benefits of curcumin are not tempered by problematic side-effects. Curcumin has low toxicity, and at worst, high doses have been known to cause stomach upsets.. It improves brain function. A recent long-term study has shown that a supplement of curcumin taken daily over 18 months improved cognition and recall ability in those over 50. It is thought that curcumin may work by breaking down the “gunk” that forms in the brain and which is thought to play a critical role in the development of Alzheimer’s.. The supplements were also shown to …

Worcestershire farm saved from £300,000 tax bill

A farm in Worcestershire has been saved after tax specialists successfully negotiated tax relief worth up to £300,000.

The land was owned by a mother and father but farmed by their son, who was at risk of being forced to sell when his parents both died within a short period of each other.

Gary Priest, partner at Midlands law firm mfg Solicitors, had been working for the family before the parents passed away.

Mr Priest reviewed the family’s complex position on inheritance tax to help them claim agricultural property relief (APR) which would otherwise have been denied due to the ownership arrangements.

The father and son went into business as partners, but the father needed to survive for two years for relief from inheritance tax.

He passed away within the two-year period. After he died, the mother and son went into partnership, but she also tragically died within two years of becoming a partner.

However, she inherited her late husband’s business activity, which added together, exceeded two years allowing the relief to be claimed.

Mr Priest said: “This was a complicated case underpinned by a family tragedy – the loss of two loving parents within a few years of each other.

“The APR to which the family should have been entitled was worth a colossal sum of money – potentially £300,000 - and if we had not acted while both parents were still alive, the entitlement to the money would have been lost forever.

“They were a genuine, hard-working farming family who just happened to have a business out of step with the rules until they sought the right legal advice.”

and

and two similar queries
select *
from news
where companyid = 1
    and date >= '01/01/2010'
    and date <= '01/31/2010'
order by date;

select *
from stockprices
where companyid = 1
    and date >= '01/01/2010'
    and date <= '01/31/2010'
order by date;

and I am getting two completely different actual execution plans
Query1: Relative to the batch: 86%  

SELECT (COST 0%) <- Nested Loops (Inneer Join)(Cost 0%) <- Index Seek (NonClustered) [News].[IX_Date](Cost 1%)
                                                          <- Key Lookup (Clustered) [News].[IX_CompanyId](Cost 99%)

Query 2: Relative to the batch: 14%  

SELECT (Cost0%) <- Sort (Cost 33%) <- Clustered Index Scan (Clustered) [StockPrices]IX_CompanyId

I am not sure why? Can you advice something?

A:

The first one is using a seek on a non covering clustered index in date order and a key lookup to get the remaining columns for rows matching companyid = 1.
The second one is doing a scan on a covering index and then sorting the filtered result. 
This is a cost based decision depending on what proportion of the table is estimated to match and the width of the two indexes (some example calculations here). 
Key lookups are expensive as each one requires performing a clustered index seek to locate the page and row concerned. This means multiple pages must be read for each row found by the nonclustered index seek (as many pages as the depth of the clustered index). Moreover the clustered index page found for one row may very likely not be correlated to the page for the next row, entailing lots of random IO.
As a result the tipping point before the plan switches to an index scan can be a very low proportion of the table. The fact that the non covering index can avoid a sort in this case may make the tipping point a bit higher than otherwise.
Look at the estimated rows from each. Also consider that the News table contains various string columns and likely fits less rows on a clustered index page than the numeric values in the StockPrices table - so a full clustered index scan on News may well be relatively more expensive and cause a higher tipping point.

Independent Co-Educational Day & Boarding School for Ages 2 - 18. The Best of British Boarding by the Sea.. Fantastic Year 6 transition day art lesson. Two groups of Year 6 students had short ‘taster’ lessons in art today as part of their experience in the Senior Department.. They learnt about the paper ‘cut outs’ by Matisse, and after reviewing and understanding the images, and use of formal elements such as shape, colour and composition, students responded by creating their own collages, inspired by natural, organic coral and leaf shapes.. Each student’s work has been combined together to produce two large scale pieces.. The groups worked very well and showed good potential as future artists! Hope they enjoyed their day!

Lansdowne Station. Baltimore, MD. - 3 Levels. - 641 Parking Spaces. Lansdowne Station is a new redevelopment project just inside the Baltimore beltway on Washington Boulevard (Route 1). The redevelopment project includes over 400,000 sf. of retail space, 55,000 sf. of office space and a new parking structure.. KEC was the engineer of record for design of the entire garage from foundations through the roof, including integral retaining walls. One unique aspect of the garage is that it is designed to incorporate retail space at the ground level with parking above. With 60 ft by 27 ft. typical bay sizes, the design using post-tensioned concrete provides expansive column-free space for retail businesses at the ground level. The store front is built integrally with the concrete frame without the need for additional steel framing for the stores.

Isotropic blackbody cosmic microwave background radiation as evidence for a homogeneous universe.
The question of whether the Universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic on the largest scales is of fundamental importance to cosmology but has not yet been answered decisively. Surprisingly, neither an isotropic primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) nor combined observations of luminosity distances and galaxy number counts are sufficient to establish such a result. The inclusion of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in CMB observations, however, dramatically improves this situation. We show that even a solitary observer who sees an isotropic blackbody CMB can conclude that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic in their causal past when the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect is present. Critically, however, the CMB must either be viewed for an extended period of time, or CMB photons that have scattered more than once must be detected. This result provides a theoretical underpinning for testing the cosmological principle with observations of the CMB alone.

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of isoeugenol (CAS No. 97-54-1) in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice (gavage studies).
Isoeugenol is one of several structurally similar phenylpropenoid compounds produced by plants. It has been extracted from calamus, savory, basil, ylang-ylang, clove, tuberose, jonquil, nutmeg, tobacco, sandalwood, dill seed, mace, gardenia, petunia, and other flowers. Isoeugenol can also be produced by isomerization of eugenol, which occurs naturally in clove, pimento, bay leaf, and cinnamon. As a fragrance with a spicy, carnation-like odor, isoeugenol is incorporated into numerous household and personal hygiene products, including perfumes, cream lotions, soaps, and detergents. As a flavoring agent, isoeugenol is added to nonalcoholic drinks, baked foods, and chewing gums. Isoeugenol was nominated by the National Cancer Institute and was selected for carcinogenicity testing because of widespread human exposure through its use as a flavoring and fragrance agent and because of its structural similarity to phenylpropenoids such as safrole, isosafrole, eugenol, methyleugenol, estragole, and anethole, most of which are known rodent carcinogens. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were administered isoeugenol (99% or greater pure) in corn oil by gavage for 3 months or 2 years. Genetic toxicity tests were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study except one 600 mg/kg male and one 37.5 mg/kg female that were killed in dosing accidents. Mean body weights of all exposed groups of males were significantly less than that of the vehicle control group; however, only the decrease for the 600 mg/kg group exceeded 10% and was considered related to isoeugenol exposure. Liver weights were significantly increased in 300 and 600 mg/kg females. The incidences of minimal atrophy of the olfactory epithelium of the nose were significantly increased in 150 mg/kg or greater males and in 300 or 600 mg/kg females. The incidence of atrophy of olfactory nerve bundles was significantly increased in 600 mg/kg females. Minimal to mild periportal hepatocellular cytoplasmic alteration occurred in all 300 or 600 mg/kg females. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. The mean body weight of 600 mg/kg males was significantly less (12%) than that of the vehicle controls. Liver weights of 300 and 600 mg/kg males were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. Minimal to moderate atrophy of olfactory epithelial tissue and nerve bundles was observed in 600 mg/kg males and females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 105 weeks. Survival rates of exposed male and female rats were similar to those of vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 300 mg/kg male rats were 9% greater than the vehicle controls at the end of the study. The general lack of toxicity and nonneoplastic lesions indicates that rats might have been able to tolerate higher doses. Two male rats in the 300 mg/kg group had rare benign or malignant thymomas, while two other males in this group had rare mammary gland carcinomas. Low incidences of minimal atrophy and minimal to mild respiratory metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium were increased in 150 mg/kg males and 300 mg/kg males and females. Similar incidences of minimal to mild olfactory epithelial degeneration in 300 mg/kg males were also increased. Incidences of keratoacanthoma of the skin were decreased in 150 and 300 mg/kg males. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 104 (females) or 105 (males) weeks. Survival of 300 mg/kg males was significantly decreased compared to the vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 300 mg/kg male and female groups were less than those of vehicle controls at the end of the study, 10% and 15% less, respectively. In all groups of exposed males, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly greater than those in the vehicle control group; incidences of multiple hepatocellular adenoma were also significantly increased. Incidences of clear cell focus were significantly increased in 75 and 150 mg/kg male mice. There was a significant positive trend in the incidences of histiocytic sarcoma in females, and this neoplasm occurred in multiple tissues. Incidences of respiratory metaplasia in olfactory epithelium in all exposed groups and of atrophy and hyaline droplet accumulation in all exposed groups except 75 mg/kg females were significantly greater than those in corresponding vehicle control groups. Incidences of minimal to marked hyperplasia of Bowman's gland were increased significantly in all exposed groups. Incidences of minimal to mild necrosis of renal papilla and mild to moderate necrosis of renal tubules were increased significantly in 300 mg/kg females. Incidences of forestomach squamous hyperplasia, inflammation, and ulceration (males only) increased with exposure and were significant in the 300 mg/kg groups. The incidence of glandular stomach ulcers was low but significantly increased in the 300 mg/kg groups. Isoeugenol was not mutagenic in two independent assays in bacteria (S. typhimurium and E. coli) conducted with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S9 liver enzymes). Neither did it induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9 activation. Frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were not increased in peripheral blood of male mice exposed to isoeugenol by gavage for 3 months; however, an increasing trend and a threefold increase in the 600 mg/kg group indicate a positive result for this test in female mice. Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of rarely occurring thymoma and mammary gland carcinoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in female F344/N rats administered 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined). There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of histiocytic sarcoma. Exposure to isoeugenol resulted in nonneoplastic lesions of the nose in male and female rats; of the nose, forestomach, and glandular stomach in male and female mice; and of the kidney in female mice.

So the postman came a little while ago..... Amongst the crap there were two things of note. Firstly a letter confirming that I had been unsuccessful in a job interview earlier this week. Second the new Howies winter catalogue arrived :o). Regular readers might have notices that my posting frequency has been rather low over the last few weeks. Truth be told, this whole job thing has been playing on my mind. It's been something I've been thinking about a great deal, but I've not really wanted to share about it on here. As I like my writings on here to be about stuff that I'm currently thinking about, I've kinda opted for not sharing much at all.. Sorry.. Anyway, life goes on, I'm just off into our local secondary school to have a chat with the head of R.E., and then I'm helping out at their new after-school club. I get to play with computers and things. Tis a hard life I know.

District nursing origins can be traced back to 1859 when philanthropist William Rathbone pioneered the provision of nursing within poorer communities. 1887 saw the Queen’s Nurses established and in 1889 a training institute was set up in Edinburgh. For over 100 years, Queen’s Nurses promoted health and wellbeing in the communities of Scotland. Today, the Queen’s Nursing Institute Scotland promotes excellence in community nursing to improve the health and well-being of the people of Scotland. Dr Alison O’Donnell (RCN History of Nursing Society) and Clare Cable (QNIS Chief Executive and Nurse Director) will explore the fascinating history of the QNIS, focussing on the role which Queen’s Nurses adopted in health promotion. This presentation will draw on materials from the QNIS Archive, maintained by the RCN.

Gatorade: Oswaldo Vizcarrondo Campaign. All soccer fans know that Oswaldo Vizcarrondo is famous for his attitude towards hard work and perseverance. Those are two values that our client, Gatorade, relied on to tell the story of one of the most important athletes of Venezuela's national soccer team in the last decade.. While recording this video in Argentina and Venezuela we discovered exactly how serious and determined an aspiring soccer player has to be to make the leap to the International level. The focus of Gatorade during this documentary was to capture people’s attention and to inspire them to be like Vizcarrondo.

Step 11: Darken the shapes of Pluto's eyes, and draw a long oval inside each eye for his pupils. Shade in the pupils except for a small circle on the top that represents glare.. Step 12: On top of Pluto's eyes, draw a curved line that resembles the lowercase letter m. This is Pluto's brow.. Step 13: Move on to drawing Pluto's jaw. Inside the U shape below the top part of his muzzle, draw two of lines to create the inside of his mouth. Then at the bottom of it, draw a couple of curved lines make Pluto's tongue.. Step 14: Finish drawing Pluto's lower jaw by following the initial line as a guide and curving it all the way up to his ear.. Step 15: To draw Pluto's ear, simply darken the shape and close the curve at the top with a rounded curve. Draw a couple of curved lines on top to represent folds of skin.

The Yankees have sold Triple-A first baseman Steve Pearce to the Baltimore Orioles for cash after he exercised a June 1 opt-out clause in his contract, according to Chad Jennings of the Journal News.. Pearce, 29-years-old, absolutely crushed the ball at Triple-A this season. In 52 games he had an amazing line of .321/.422/.574/.996. Usually a line like that would at least get a team to give you a chance in The Show, but the Yankees were set at first base and with Eric Chavez healthy it didn’t make a lot of sense to promote him.. So they sold his rights to the Orioles rather than lose him for nothing. Hard to blame them for that, but hopefully it doesn’t come back to haunt them as he will join the O’s Major League team.

NE 45th Street Viaduct

Seattle's topography has always been a challenge to transportation, especially along west to east routes. A concerted effort in the 1930s to ease automobile traffic led to a series of bridge projects including construction of the NE 45th St Viaduct that would provide a direct route from Sand Point Way and Laurelhurt to Highway 99. At that time, the land at the base was mostly farmland. The project was approved in 1935 by Ordinance 65629 with major community support from the University Commercial Club. Construction did not begin until 1938. (The street designation was E 45th Street until 1961 when the directional designation was changed to NE.)

The viaduct was funded with a combination of federal Public Works Administration (PWA) dollars ($103,550), state gasoline tax revenue ($200,000), and a small appropriation in 1939 from the City Street Fund ($8,000). Other PWA-funded projects in 1938 included the Montlake Boulevard pedestrian overcrossing, 24th Avenue Southwest paving, East Madison Street repaving, and the Ballard Bridge.

The project was completed in September 1939 with great fanfare. A celebration luncheon was held at the Edmond Meany Hotel on September 28, followed by a parade that included the Husky Marching Band. The procession made its way from the Meany to the dedication ceremonies where Mayor Langlie cut the ribbon in front of several thousand spectators.

In 1955, funds were approved to widen the viaduct from two to three lanes; construction took place in 1956-1957. The construction was estimated to cost $192,000 and the funds were approved as part of a $10 million traffic improvement bond issue approved by Seattle voters in 1954. Additional funds for this project were approved in 1956, increasing the appropriation from $218,000 to $248,000. A 1956 scale of wages shows that carpenters earned $2.80 per hour in that year. The additional funds in 1956 were for a bus stop and for approaches to University Village. During the construction, traffic was limited to one lane eastbound. Westbound traffic was asked to detour to Blakely Avenue and Ravenna Place. Once the construction was finished, two lanes were designated for westbound traffic and one for eastbound. By the mid-1950s, the farmland was gone, but a Carnation plant and Shell station could be seen on NE 45th.

During a 1972 Engineering Department survey of bridge needs, it became evident that the wooden trestles on the east end of the viaduct were compromised by a 1966 fire and needed to be replaced. After two public hearings, it was determined that there would be no big changes to the viaduct. Work began in January 1976. Federal funds were used to help fund the project, and additional funds were approved in 1976 for rail replacement. In 1976, carpenters earned $8.90 per hour. For various reasons, mostly related to the pilings used and the noise of the pile-driving machine, the work took longer than expected. Neighborhood groups and businesses, as well as the University of Washington, made their concerns about the delay known to the City. The viaduct was closed from January to October 17th, 1976.

In 1983, City funds were approved for deck rehabilitation on the viaduct. Adverse weather and an initial unavailability of specialized equipment needed for the project required the completion date to be postponed until the spring of 1984. A temporary asphalt overlay was installed to enable the viaduct to be used during the time construction was stopped and restarted.

After a fire in January 1996, the viaduct was briefly closed so an inspection could be made of the supports on the west end.

In 2010, the viaduct was closed again for several months for a major project to replace the west approach. Portions of the approach dated back to 1938 and needed to be replaced for safety reasons. The project was budgeted at $30 million and was expected to last about six months.

Rising to the Challenge for Alzheimer’s. GEW’s UK Sales Manager, Chris Nuttall, has recently successfully completed the arduous Three Peaks Challenge in aid of charity. Chris and his teammates took on the challenge on 29th June, which unfortunately for them also turned out to be one of the hottest days of the year. Nevertheless, they persevered and completed the course in only 11 hours and 48 minutes.. In what can only be described as blistering heat, they set out on the 26-mile challenge across the three highest peaks in Yorkshire, all in aid of a great cause. The training they had put in stood them in good stead, although Chris commented afterwards that ‘his feet told a different story’.. Chris thanked everyone at GEW for their sponsorship and support, which contributed to the highly impressive total sum raised… Chris’s NuttyBullers Team raised a massive £3,093.42 for The Alzheimer’s Society.

Effect of interaction with coesite silica on the conformation of Cecropin P1 using explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulation.
Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out for the antimicrobial peptides (i) Cecropin P1 and C-terminus cysteine modified Cecropin P1 (Cecropin P1 C) in solution, (ii) Cecropin P1 and Cecropin P1 C adsorbed onto coesite -Si - O - and Si - O - H surfaces, and (iii) Cecropin P1 C tethered to coesite -Si - O - surface with either (PEO)(3) or (PEO)(6) linker. Low energy structures for Cecropin P1 and Cecropin P1 C in solution consists of two regions of high α helix probability with a sharp bend, consistent with the available structures of other antimicrobial peptides. The structure of Cecropin P1 C at low ionic strength of 0.02 M exhibits two regions of high α helix probability (residues AKKLEN and EGI) whereas at higher ionic strength of 0.12 M, the molecule was more compact and had three regions of higher α helix probability (residues TAKKLENSA, ISE, and AIQG) with an increase in α helical content from 15.6% to 18.7% as a result of shielding of electrostatic interactions. In the presence of Cecropin P1 C in the vicinity of -Si - O - surface, there is a shift in the location of two peaks in H - O - H density profile to larger distances (2.95 Å and 7.38 Å compared to 2.82 Å and 4.88 Å in the absence of peptide) with attenuated peak intensity. This attenuation is found to be more pronounced for the first peak. H-bond density profile in the vicinity of -Si - O - surface exhibited a single peak in the presence of Cecropin P1 C (at 2.9 Å) which was only slightly different from the profile in the absence of polypeptide (2.82 Å) thus indicating that Cecropin P1 C is not able to break the H-bond formed by the silica surface. The α helix probability for different residues of adsorbed Cecropin P1 C on -Si - O - surface is not significantly different from that of Cecropin P1 C in solution at low ionic strength of 0.02 M whereas there is a decrease in the probability in the second (residues ISE) and third (residues AIQG) α helical regions at higher ionic strength of 0.12 M. Though the total α helical content of adsorbed and tethered Cecropin P1 C was lower for hydrophilic Si - O - H surface compared to hydrophobic -Si - O -, hydrophobicity of the surface did not significantly affect the α helix probability of different residues. The conformation of Cecropin P1 C in solution is closer to that of tethered to -Si - O - with (PEO)(6) than that tethered with (PEO)(3) as a result of less surface interaction of tethered polypeptide with a longer linker. At low ionic strength of 0.02 M, tethered Cecropin P1 C to -Si - O - is found to exhibit lower α helix (13.0%) compared to adsorbed (15.6%) for (PEO)(3) linker with this difference being insignificant for larger (PEO)(6) linker molecule. Experimental values of % α helix inferred from circular dichroism spectra of Cecropin P1 in solution as well as in adsorbed state on silica surface compared well with the corresponding values obtained from MD simulation thereby validating the simulation procedure.

Structure and thermal expansion of the tungsten bronze Pb₂KNb₅O₁₅.
The structure and thermal expansion behavior of the tetragonal tungsten bronze oxide Pb2KNb5O15 were investigated by neutron powder diffraction and high-temperature X-ray diffraction. Below the Curie temperature, T(C) (orthorhombic phase, T(C) ≈ 460 °C), the cell parameters a and c increase with temperature, while b decreases. The thermal expansion coefficients are α(a) = 1.29 × 10(-5) °C(-1), α(b) = -1.56 × 10(-5) °C(-1), and α(c) = 1.62 × 10(-5) °C(-1). Temperature-dependent second harmonic generation (SHG), dielectric, and polarization-electrical field (P-E) hysteresis loop measurements were performed to study the symmetry and electric properties. We show that the distortion and cooperative rotation of NbO6 octahedrons are directly responsible for the negative thermal expansion coefficient along the polar b axis. It is suggested that Pb-O covalency, especially in the large and asymmetric pentagonal prisms, may be related to orthorhombic distortion and abnormal spontaneous polarization along the b axis. This study shows that tungsten bronze families are possible candidates for exploring negative thermal expansion materials.

So let’s get out of the weeds and talk about some high level scenarios that might resonate for your organization.. Employee appreciation is normally one of the biggest drivers of employee engagement. Employees want to be recognized for doing a good job, making an extra effort or just solid and steady performance as a dependable team member. So what can be done? Here are a few ideas:.

First prize!. Just heard that Flip has won the 2012 Immanuel College Book Award, voted for by pupils at the independent school in Hertfordshire . . . my first prize as a teen/YA author! (I was starting to get twitchy – from 13 shortlistings and longlistings, FLIP hasn’t won any of the seven prizes that have declared so far.). I’m especially flattered to have won this one, given the strength of the shortlist – Gregory Hughes, Patrick Ness, Garth Nix, Delphine de Vigan and Carlos Ruiz Zafon. My spy in the camp tells me Flip pipped Mr Ness’s excellent A Monster Calls by eight votes. I am very grateful to all the pupils who voted for my novel and to Ethan Cohen, in Year 7, who nominated it in the first place.

The business of a contact center is to provide rapid and efficient interaction between agents and customers, or prospective customers, using various interaction methods and media, including phone, fax, e-mail and messaging. A manager in a contact center typically uses force management software (FMS) to produce a schedule that includes agents assigned to work activities for specific time periods. During the workday, the FMS produces staffing statistics. The manager uses staffing statistics to adjust the number of agents assigned to particular activities when the contact center performance is either above or below contact center goals (e.g., a desired service level.) If performance exceeds the goals, the manager can reduce the number of agents. If performance does not meet goals, the manager can add more agents to the schedule.
Skills-based routing attempts to find the best available match between the needs of the customer and the various proficiencies or skills of available agents. Providing staffing statistics in a skills-based environment is difficult. One problem is providing an accurate count of agents. A multi-skill agent could be counted against more than one (skill) queue. A conventional FMS simply counts an agent with multiple skills against all queues, resulting in an miscount. Furthermore, a conventional FMS reports one combined count, rather than a count for each skill-related queue.

Hu arrives in Sudan

Hu's visit comes amid hopes he would push Khartoum to co-operate with the UN on Darfur.

02 Feb 2007 10:25 GMT

Hu Jintao, seen here in Liberia, is on an eight-nation Africa tour [AFP]

"I am extremely happy to visit Sudan at the invitation of president Omar al-Bashir," Hu said in a statement at the airport.

"Although the distance between China and Sudan is great, the friendship between the two people is deeply rooted."

'Bilateral relations'

A small crowd of Chinese residents and Chinese UN peacekeepers here waved Chinese and Sudanese flags as the two leaders reviewed a presidential guard.

Officials in Khartoum said Hu's visit was geared toward "bilateral relations and other important issues of common interest," without specifying if these would be commercial matters or would include human rights issues.

But Beijing has raised expectations that Hu may bring some pressure on Khartoum to show flexibility in ending Darfur's bloodshed.

Chinese officials ahead of Hu's visit urged Sudan to cooperate in finding a solution in Darfur in rare public pronouncements under China's traditional refusal to interfere in what it considers other countries' internal affairs.

"This visit is going to be a great boost for the distinguished Sudanese-Chinese relations in various fields," al-Bashir said on Thursday.

China, which is the biggest foreign investor in Sudan and buys two-thirds of the country's oil exports, has used its veto-wielding status at the UN security council to prevent harsh measures against Sudan over the Darfur conflict.

Sudan has refused demands it allow UN peacekeepers into the region, calling "neocolonial" a UN security council plan to replace an overwhelmed African Union force in the region with some 22,000 UN peacekeepers.

Dental caries, sugar-eating habits and toothbrushing in groups of 4-year-old children 1967-1997 in the city of Umeå, Sweden.
Four-year-old children in the city of Umeå, northern Sweden, have been the subjects for studies of dental caries at regular intervals between 1967 and 1997. Similar methods and criteria were used in all studies and the children were selected from the same catchment areas. The results of this study signified a shift in the trend towards a declining caries prevalence among 4-year-old children. There was a slight non-significant increase in the number of children with caries as well as in the mean dmft and dmfs values between 1992 and 1997. The mean dmfs value was 7.8 in 1967 and declined to 4.5 in 1971. It was 2.9 in 1976 and 2.0 in 1980 and 1987, 1.8 in 1992 and increased to 2.0 in 1997. Ten percent of the children were immigrant or refugee children in 1997 compared to 6% in 1992 and they had a significantly higher caries prevalence than children with a Swedish background (p<0.001). In 1997, 58% of the children had one or more daily intakes of sugary snacks such as buns, cakes sweets, soft drinks, etc. There was an increasing consumption of sweets and soft drinks between 1987 and 1997.

The Tokyo Sky Tree is a broadcasting tower under construction in the Narihirabashi/Oshiage area of the Sumida ward in Tokyo, Japan. After the construction completes, it will be the tallest artificial structure in Japan at a height of 634.00 m (2,080 ft). The present Tokyo Tower (333 m) is not tall enough for complete digital terrestrial television broadcasting coverage due to the construction of many high rise buildings in the central part of the Tokyo Metropolis..

The group drove out of the airport with $5 million in cash before police arrived. Nobody was arrested.. “Everyone who passes through the Viracopos Airport is at the mercy of thugs,” said Alberto Carvalho, a director at the National Union of Airport Workers, who has documented several instances of muggings, carjackings and kidnappings of employees in the vicinity of the airport. The highway that leads to the airport is notorious for crime, and several kidnapping attempts on the road made headlines here in recent years. “The airport is completely unprepared to deal with these risks,” Carvalho said.. The heist is part of a crime wave that has made transporting goods in Brazil particularly dangerous...”. Read more:

Half of the American electorate now agree with President Trump about special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia collusion investigation.

The results from a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll released Monday show 50 percent of registered voters agree with Trump's claim that he is the target of a "witch hunt" and that he has been subject to more investigations than his predecessors due to politics.

Forty-seven percent of respondents disagreed, while 3 percent had no opinion.

The poll was conducted following reports in recent weeks indicating Mueller was winding down after 34 people and three companies have been indicted or taken guilty pleas as part of the investigation, none having to do with Russian collusion. However, the special counsel's office said Friday former Trump campaign official Rick Gates is still helping "several ongoing investigations," indicating the probe still has a ways to go.

The poll also took place after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort got sentenced to roughly seven and a half years in prison for conspiracy and fraud, far less time than what Mueller's prosecutors recommended.

The newly released phone survey of 1,000 voters was conducted Wednesday through Sunday as Trump tweeted more barbs at Mueller, including one on Friday that asserted Mueller should not have been appointed and there should be no report from the special counsel. "This was an illegal & conflicted investigation in search of a crime," Trump said.

The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, showed a stark partisan divide, with 86 Republicans agreeing Trump is the victim of a "witch hunt." Among Democrats, the number was significantly lower, 14 percent, but among independents 54 percent agreed, while 42 percent did not.

[Byron York: With Mueller office emptying, dramatic predictions remain unfulfilled]

Bayalaata

Bayalāṭa  or Bayalāṭada () is a form of Yakshagana found in southern Indian region of Karnataka featuring stories from Indian epic poetry and the Puranas rendered as dance and drama. Bayalāṭa literally means open theater drama and marks the end of harvest season. The most popular theme for bayalāṭa is the story of Kōṭi and Cennayya, which has deep-rooted significance for the people of Tulu Nadu. There are generally five types of Bayalayas -Dasarat,Sannata,Doddata,Parikatha and Yakshanaga .Parijat and Yakshagana are narrated by single sutradhar while other three forms are performed in corus of three-four, aided by Vidhushaka.

The Yakshagana stage is set before the village temple on a sandy beach or in open fields. A low platform about 16' 10 20' with bamboo poles at each corner garlanded with flowers, plantain and mango leaves, and roofed with matted palm leaves. At sunset the sound of a chande, a high pitched drum, announces forthcoming performances.

Browsing Medical Oncology by Subjects. Now showing items 1-1 of 1. - Imaging in gastrointestinal stromal tumours: current status and future directions.Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) have distinct biological and treatment-related features posing challenges for imaging. In this review the importance of imaging in different stages of patient management is discussed, emphasizing the unique characteristics of GISTs. Potential pitfalls of using the standard response criteria on conventional imaging have been highlighted. These include size measurements, which may not adequately reflect response rates, pseudo-progression, and spurious new lesions. Furthermore, the role of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in early response evaluation and in the detection of both primary and acquired resistance is explored. The current role and future directions of use of both conventional and metabolic imaging in the management of GISTs are discussed.

Don't get so caught up in SAT scores and grades+ READ ARTICLE. In an era of rising tuition and worries about “paper classes,” it’s easy for students (and parents) to get overwhelmed about making the right decisions during the college admissions process.. Admissions expert Pamela Donnelly, author of the recently published 4 Keys to College Admissions Success, offers several tips for families looking for a way to stay sane.. The process “is a blip on the chart of a much larger movie called life,” Donnelly says, encouraging students to not get so caught up on SAT scores and grades that it becomes overwhelming. Once applications are in, Donnelly wants students to “let it go” and celebrate the completion of the process rather than stressing about where they may get in.. Catch more of her tips in the video above.

Q:

How to input password to git pull command?

I have written scripts for Windows and Linux to essentially set up a new users workspace with all the git repositories from our server.
I would like the user to enter the password for our server once, store it in a local variable, pass that variable to each git pull command, then erase the password variable and exit.
How can I input the password when the git pull command requests it? Both for Windows batch file and a Linux shell script.
Here is code from the Linux script:
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter password: "
read pswd
clear #No screen peaking

#This is repeated for each repo
location=folderName
mkdir $location
cd $location
git init
git remote add origin git@<server>:$location.git
git pull origin master 
#Above prompts for password & is where I want to automatically input $pswd

I've tried various things recommended on SO and elsewhere, such as piping, reading from .txt file, etc. I would prefer to not need anything more than plain old windows cmd and Linux terminal commands. And as this script is just for set up purposes, I do not need to securely store the password permanently with something like ssh agent.
I'm running Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.10, but this script is meant for setting up new users, so it should ideally work on most distributions.

A:

Synopsis:
git pull "https://<username>:<password>@github.com/<github_account>/<repository_name>.git" <branch_name>

Example:
git pull "https://admin:12345@github.com/Jet/myProject.git" master

Note: This works for me on a bash script

A:

I would really recommend to not try and manage that password step, and delegate that (both on Linux and Windows) to git credential helper.
See:

"Git http - securely remember credentials"
"How to use git with gnome-keyring integration"

The user will enter the password only once per session.

This valley is a strange 196-mile (315km) scar that sits almost right in the middle of the Martian equator on the northern edge of the Valles Marineris canyon, almost 8 km-deep trough stretching 315 km in an east-west direction and 125 km from north to south at its widest point.

Q:

Git repo access issue

I have added ssh key to my git repo through below command and now getting below error:
CMD git config --global url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf https://github.com/

 Error : User1’s-MacBook-Pro:untitled folder ndpiparava$ git clone  https://github.com/XXX-Asft/XXXX
Cloning into 'XXXXX'...
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

I have realised that I have made mistake by setting up ssh instead of Https.
Is there any way that I can remove my ip from ssh list for my remote git and start using https?

A:

git config --global url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf https://github.com/

This means any url starting with https://github.com/ will be rewritten with ssh://git@github.com/.
There is no "ip from ssh list for my remote git" to remove.  
You can simply delete that global config setting.
git config --global --unset url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf

And you can remove your public key you set on your GitHub account.



Written by the B&B Crew. Thursday, 29 July 2010 15:00. Trusted Fully Cycle and Reprazent member Krust is about to launch his label Rebel Instinct. Krust himself sees it more of a "creative hub, an outlet for all of his own creative projects", but that's pretty much the definition of a label now isn't it?. Next to being an outlet for all or Krust's own creative projects, the label will also function as a breeding ground for new talent. The label is said to be a hub where likeminded people can work on their ideas alone or together. "Krust: At its heart it is an entertainment company with social implication."The coming months will see Krust releasing his own material on the label as well as a book titled Look Before You Leap which will feature additional music from George Kurtz, Mark Day and Krust's own band The Rules..

Efficacy of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage (PTCD) in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.
For patients with pancreatic cancer who suffer from obstructive jaundice, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage (PTCD) is the treatment of choice. However, there are no standards for palliative care for patients undergoing this treatment. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of post-palliative treatment in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer who were previously treated with PTCD. The 47 patients included in this study had unresectable pancreatic cancer, presented with obstructive jaundice, had no prior history of chemotherapy, and underwent PTCD. They were divided into two groups. Group A was composed of 21 patients who received post-palliative treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, or chemoradiotherapy). Group B consisted of 26 patients who were under best supportive care (BSC). We compared the median overall survival time between the two groups to evaluate the efficacy of post-palliative treatment. The median overall survival time (MOST) of patients undergoing PTCD was 7.19 months. MOST was 9.07 months for patients in group A (P = 0.017 vs. group B) and 5.52 months for those in group B. Among the patients receiving post-palliative treatment, 12 (57% of patients) received only a single therapy (either chemo or radiation), and 9 (43%) received chemoradiotherapy. Their median overall survival times were 8.31 and 11.15 months, respectively (P = 0.325). Post-palliative treatment in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer previously treated with PTCD is more effective than only best supportive care alone. Patients receiving both chemo and radiation may benefit more in terms of overall survival compared to patients receiving only one or the other.

The other day, one of the buddies of Governor Doug "Cup or Waffle Cone" Ducey was quoted as saying that Arizona needed to get rid of Common Core and instead institute "Arizona" standards for education.. What makes this so funny is that Arizona has no education standards. We've proved this for many years now. Many of our elected officials are proud of this fact. Indeed, they run on a promise of maintaining it. And since they continue to be elected and re-elected, the typical Arizona voter must agree with them.. We also have no standards for political candidates. We prove this on a daily, if not hourly, basis, too.. Obviously, these two missing standards go hand in 29, 2015. Today's Chuckle

(VIDEO) How to Improve PPC CampaignsWritten by Pace Lattin. September 23, 2013 # 9:27 am # Expert Guides, Specials #. Great article I agree with all of the above. Only bit I’d add is a clear focus on the call to action itself. A PPC or Pay-per-action campaign can be great tools, but the action itself better be something that converts those leads into customers or you’re still going to see that high bounce rate.. Particularly liked the competitor idea, I hadn’t thought of that strategy in the Adwords environment..

Oxfam’s new report, ‘Reward Work, Not Wealth,’ reveals how the global economy enables the wealthy elite to capture vast wealth while hundreds of millions of people struggle to survive on poverty pay.. Eighty two percent of the wealth generated last year went to the richest one percent of the global population, while the 3.7 billion people who make up the poorest half of the world saw no increase in their wealth. This research includes the stunning new finding that the economy created a new billionaire every other day over a period of one year. The report is being released as political and business elites, including President Trump, are heading to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum..  as Reward Work, Not Wealth.

Mechanism of the inhibitory action of linoleic acid on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
Linoleic acid, but not stearic acid, inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 8325. Growth inhibition was associated with an increase in the permeability of the bacterial membrane. The presence of a plasmid conferring resistance to penicillin (PC plasmid, e.g. pI258blaI-) increased the growth inhibitory and membrane permeability effects of linoleic acid. Under growth inhibitory conditions, linoleic acid was incorporated into the lipid of both PC plasmid-containing and PC plasmid-negative bacteria and there was little difference between these cultures in the uptake or fate of linoleic acid. Experiments using a glycerol auxotroph of S. aureus suggested that free linoleic acid, rather than lipid containing this acid, inhibits growth. Linoleic acid probably inhibits growth by increasing the permeability of the bacterial membrane as a result of its surfactant action, and the presence of the PC plasmid increases these effects.

Effect of processing parameters on the electrophoretic deposition of carbon black nanoparticles in moderately viscous systems.
Polymer-melt-based manufacturing processes for nanostructures offer high-rate, environmentally friendly, and commercially viable alternatives to solution-based methods. In this work, electrophoresis of a model carbon black and polystyrene system with moderate viscosity was used to investigate the viability of adapting nanoassembly processes to the high viscosity environment of polymer melts. The presence of polystyrene did not prevent deposition of carbon black, but deposition rates decreased at shorter deposition times; deposition was not linear with increasing applied voltage; and greater solution concentrations reduced the critical voltages (i.e., the voltage at which the rate of deposition changed). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results and comparison of experimental data with Hamaker's model showed that about 1.6% of the available polystyrene was initially deposited with the carbon black. At voltages above the critical voltage, the deposited mass was less than the Hamaker prediction, indicating the formation of electrically insulating layers on the electrodes. The overall behavior suggests that polymer melt-based processes could be employed for high-rate fabrication of nano-optical devices, biochemical sensors, and nanoelectronics.

Something familiar - I hope. The grid produced by Romek Marber for the standard penguin paperback jacket. Consistency and an underlying structure are the watchwords for the book project. Marber's grid was the skeleton for hundreds of book jackets it enabled variety and diversity whilst maintaining a visual/branded consistency that made the appreciation of difference all the more acute - arguably the grid creates opportunity for the Illustrator/Designer. So thinking about a 'system' for the book products when considering option 1 bear in mind that a visual structure, like the underlying grid, gives you a certain secure freedom.

Because salmon is packed with so much protein, it is extremely easy to digest and only takes about 12 hours to do so. There are other types of seafood such as shrimp and calamari which can take up to 24 hours to digest and they are considered to be the â€œheavyâ€ types of seafood.. Red meat can also take a long time to go through the digestive tract which is why it shouldnâ€™t be consumed on a regular basis but rather in moderation. There are a number of great things about salmon, including the high amount of omega-3 fatty acids in it which can do all sorts of great things for the brain.

The pick-up sensors are characterised by extreme long life due to their non-contacting and therefore almost wear-free mode of operation. Measurements are carried out by scanning a gear tooth or pulse wheel. The speed sensor is placed at a particular distance above the wheel.. Pick-up sensors use the Hall effect to capture driving speed. Rotational direction can also be determined. Two Hall elements are arranged in a relative geometrical position to one another within the pick-up sensor so that both revolution and rotational direction can be determined. The output levels of both receivable signals, galvanically separated from each other, are processed for a wide range of supply voltages.

Milyika Carroll

Milyika Carroll (born 1958), also known as Alison Carroll, Alison Milyika Carroll, or "Windlass" Carroll, is an Aboriginal Australian artist. She is also a community leader on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia.

Life
Milyika was born in 1958, in Ernabella, northwest South Australia. At that time, it was a Presbyterian mission for Aboriginal people. After finishing primary school here, she went to high school in Alice Springs, at Saint Philips College and Yirara College. She moved back to Ernabella after finishing school. She briefly worked at the community's craft centre, making hand-painted bookmarks and gift cards. She also learned to use batik methods, which had been introduced to the community in 1971.

After about one or two years of working at the craft centre, Carroll decided to become a health worker. She did her training in Adelaide, and then went back to Ernabella to work in the clinic. She still worked at the craft centre sometimes, learning under her mother.

Carroll is married to Pepai Carroll, and they have five children.

Community work
Carroll has been involved in the administration of Ernabella Arts for several years. She served as its chairperson from 2001 to 2003, as its manager from 2004 to 2007, and then as chairperson again from 2007 to 2010. She was also the chairperson of Aṉanguku Arts and Culture Aboriginal Corporation from 2004 to 2006, and then became its director. Aṉanguku Arts is the organisation that coordinates and supports development of the art economy on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands. Her husband Pepai has also served as the organisation's chairman.

In April 2008, Carroll was chosen to attend the Australia 2020 Summit in Canberra, where she and Makinti Minutjukur represented the APY communities. She has since been involved in school administration in Ernabella, including serving as the chairwoman of the Governing Council of Ernabella Aṉangu School since 2011.

Artwork
Carroll is known for painting, printmaking, batik, ceramic and textile works. She uses several printmaking methods, including lithographs, etchings and screen printing. Her painted designs are called , which are designs and symbols that mean something to her. They represent her identity and her own view of the world, and are associated with her family's Dreaming legends. The designs are abstract, and come from ancient ceremonial designs (historically painted on the body or rock).

Carroll has had her works held in many public and private galleries both in Australia and other countries. Example of her batik works are held in the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, the State Library of South Australia in Adelaide, and the British Museum. The National Museum of Australia and the National Gallery of Australia both contain multiple examples of Carroll's printings, etchings, batik works, and textile paintings.

One of her earliest works, a painting done on paper, was chosen as one of the finalists for the first National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 1984. In 2011, Carroll's uncle, Dickie Minyintiri, became one of the oldest people to win the award.

Recognition
Carroll won the Premier’s Award for Lifetime Achievement at the South Australian Ruby Awards in 2018.

The Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation (RIRRC) was awarded a gold medal in the Solid Waste Association of North America’s (SWANA) 2013 Excellence Awards for their retrofitted Materials Recycling Facility Tuesday in Long Beach, Calif. The award was for the national competition in the Recycling Systems category and the quasi-public organization was honored at SWANA’s WASTECON conference.

“It means a lot to us,” said RIRRC Executive Director Michael OConnell, adding that SWANA is the premiere association in the country and this is considered the best award one can receive. “It’s not a small task. We’re really happy about it.”

According to a press release from SWANA, awards recognize “outstanding solid waste programs and facilities that advance the practice of environmentally and economically sound solid waste management through their commitment to utilizing effective technologies and processes in system design and operations, advancing worker and community health and safety, and implementing successful public education and out reach programs.” In order to win awards, programs must also be fiscally and environmentally responsible.

RIRRC entered the competition in May, providing great detail about their new facility. Beginning in fall 2011, the process began to transition the facility from a dual stream system to “a highly automated and efficient 50 tons per hour single stream facility.”

“It allows us to separate plastics we couldn’t separate before,” said OConnell about the new facility, which was completed in spring 2012 and just finished it’s first fiscal year of operation.

OConnell believes they won the award because it was a large task to complete, they remained operational during the retrofitting and the project was completed with no issue.

“I’ve never seen something so complex turn on and be able to work properly,” said OConnell about the retrofitting of the facility. “We were not only able to fund this internally without taxpayers funding, we were also on time, on budget and meeting all of the special requirements.”

OConnell also said the size of the Johnston-based operation could play a part in its success.

“We’re a big facility,” said OConnell, adding he believes the RIRRC facility is one of the biggest in the world, processing almost 100,000 tons of materials each year. The property is 1,100 acres and the facility serves nearly 1.05 million Rhode Islanders.

The retrofitting of the 77,260-square-foot Materials Recycling Facility was also cost-effective. An evaluation was completed prior to the transition to determine what equipment could be re-purposed, which reduced the cost and maximized the investment. OConnell said the $16.9 million cost of the project was funded internally.

“We had been saving and planning for a number of years,” said OConnell.

According to their application, by refitting the existing building and not starting from the ground up, the proposed cost was cut in half.

OConnell also pointed out that the single stream system has proven incredibly successful and the tonnage went up 11 percent in FY13 after the system became operational. According to their application to SWANA, baled product shipments have increased by 15 percent because of more materials coming in, lower loss of recyclable to residue and continuous inbound tonnage increases.

“It’s considered easier for consumers because they don’t have to separate [recyclables]. It’s also easier for businesses because they only need one dumpster,” said OConnell. “The message to the consumer is to make it simple.”

He added that the simplicity of using a single stream system would lead to continuous increases in recycling across the state over the years.

“This is really the way everyone’s been going,” said OConnell of the single stream system.

OConnell added that communities that have made the move over to the automated system with the larger receptacles have seen an increase of 15 to 20 percent in recycled materials.

The application also states that the facility has seen improved performance in all areas including improved product quality, operational efficiency, reliability, diversion and safety.

Updates were also made to the education center to reflect the transition to the new system. One feature is a virtual tour featuring 12 flat screen monitors with videos detailing the steps in the recycling process.

“I think if you came in and saw it, it would speak for itself,” said OConnell.

Former midfielder Mohamed Aboutrika was voted the greatest player in Egyptian history in a FIFA poll, overcoming the likes of Mohamed Salah, Mahmoud Al-Khateeb, and Hossam Hassan.. Aboutrika topped the poll with a sweeping 56 percent, followed by Salah taking 36 percent of the votes. Khateeb gathered 6 percent of the votes, while Hassan took 2 percent.. Aboutrika, now retired, led Egypt’s national team for nearly a decade and is widely considered to be the most admired Egyptian player in his generation.. During his career, Aboutrika plates for Al-Ahly, and led the team to five CAF Champions League trophies. The club also won the Egyptian League five times and the Egyptian Cup twice with him on the team.. Aboutrika is currently resides in Qatar. He was accused in 2017 of funding the banned Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt’s government designated as a ‘terrorist’ organization.. In 2015, a government committee which was established to seize and manage Brotherhood properties and funds froze Aboutrika’s assets.

There are many situations in which businesses request information from suppliers, customers and potential customers, for example to obtain contact details, to understand customer requirements to enable targeted marketing, or to obtain feedback on existing services so that improvements can be made. Electronic forms may be completed and sent on-line to a business when ordering products and services, or to provide requested information. There are problems associated with the use of electronic forms, and each of the other known ways of obtaining requested information also has problems.
A service provider or product manufacturer may publish an order form on their Web site to enable customers to order products and services. Hyperlinks to the order form may be provided within other Web pages, or the URL for accessing the form may be published in a magazine or newspaper. A potential customer can navigate to the location of the form on the Web and then fill in the form on-line or download the form over the network for later completion. A reliable network connection is necessary for accessing and submitting on-line forms. Users of bandwidth-limited wireless devices are often reluctant to spend time navigating through a Web site to find the appropriate form, and so any requirement to locate a form via a network reduces the number of people completing the form. If storage space is limited, the device user may also be reluctant to save multiple forms onto their device. Any requirement for users to manually enter long URLs introduces the likelihood of errors.
Another option is for a corporation to transmit a form to their customers' mobile telephones or other devices when requesting information. A number of projects have proposed specifications and languages for Web-based forms (such as the W3C's XForms, the Extensible Forms Description Language (XFDL), the Form Automation Markup Language (FAML) and Wireless Markup Language (WML) forms) and some are compatible with low-bandwidth devices with a small user interface. Forms have the advantage of controlling the format in which data is entered and hence limiting the scope for user errors when entering data.
However, a broadcast solution has the problem that the form may be received correctly only by a subset of the target audience (such as, in the case of WML, users of WAP-compliant telephones that are currently switched on and accessible via the network). Even if correctly received, the recipients may still choose not to save the forms onto their devices, for example because the recipient has no interest in the form at the time they receive it, and possibly also because of concerns about wasting storage or unwillingness to incur the costs and delays of communicating with a WAP server. If a form is imposed on a mobile device user at a time when it is not convenient to complete the form, there is a high likelihood that the form will be deleted. There is a need for data collection methods which are very convenient for end users to increase the proportion of end users willing to participate.
Some corporations have attempted to collect information from potential customers via Short Message Service (SMS) text messaging. SMS messaging has the advantages of convenience and low cost, and the possibility of asynchronous message delivery by telecommunication network providers gives scalability and a degree of reliability of communications. A corporation running a competition or advertisement may invite competitors to submit entries by text messaging for these reasons, or a corporation may wish to target advertisements at young people (who often use text messaging extensively). For example, television broadcasting corporations sometimes invite viewers to use SMS messaging to vote on the outcome of a program, hoping to boost ratings by encouraging a sense of audience participation.
However, errors often arise because text messaging users fail to comply with the data format requirements of the data requester. A corporation may require responses from its customers in a particular format to enable accurate automated addition of responses to a database, and so the corporation may provide format instructions. For example, spaces between a customer's answers and commas between sections of the customer's address may be treated as delimiters within a transmitted data string that are used to control how the information within a response is entered into the corporation's database. A great many users fail to follow the instructions correctly and either enter their information incorrectly or give up because of the effort involved. These issues, and the limited screen size of many mobile devices, mean that the information requester may not solve the problem by publishing detailed instructions.
Let us assume that a corporation requires address details to be entered in a format such as ‘number street name’, ‘district’, ‘city’, ‘postcode’ (or zip code), ‘country’, to enable the information to be automatically entered into the correct database fields. However, the address “21 Belvue Road, Chariton, Southampton, SO19 3YT, UK” is entered by a user as “21, Belvue Road, Chariton, Southampton SO19 3YT, UK”. In the absence of address validation and automatic correction, the address may be interpreted as follows:
‘number and street name’ = ‘21’‘district’ = ‘Belvue Road’‘city’ = ‘Charlton’‘postcode’ = ERROR‘country’ = ‘UK’
The example shows how minor errors in data entry can result in database errors or input data being rejected as invalid. In this example, the ERROR message appears if ‘Southampton SO19 3YT’ is recognized as an invalid post code but is not automatically corrected. This example is representative of a very common problem for corporations wishing to obtain information via text messaging. The combination of formatting errors and users' reluctance to invest much time and effort typically results in a much smaller number of valid responses than the data-requesting corporation hoped for.

Weekend reading: a State of Politics article about proposed legislation for a WPA-style jobs program in New York State. Jeremy Cohan recently sent along a short article from State of Politics about a recent bill introduced by New York State Assemblywoman Pat Fahy, aimed at helping Millennials laid off from their jobs due to the COVID-19 shutdown. The legislation would create a new WPA-style program that would provide employment in fields like “contact tracing, conservation and climate mitigation.” In the article, Fahy says:. “Nearly one-third of those under 35 are out of work with the majority in low-wage, retail sector, or gig-economy jobs […] Creating the WPA-PR would provide young New Yorkers with good-paying jobs in the creative economy and bolster the state’s arts and cultural institutions. A bold investment like the WPA-PR would help create and train a new state green workforce, build clean-energy infrastructure, and reinvigorate the promise of the American Dream in NY.”.

Price Adjustment within a Framework of Symmetric Oligopoly. An Analysis of Pricing in 380 U.S. Manufacturing Industries 1958-71. AbstractThis paper is concerned with the generation and testing of predictions on price adjustment from a model of symmetric oligopoly. Two types of industry demand regimes are considered, linear and iso-elastic. It is shown that these can be distinguished by a simple test, and linear demand is given strong support. It is then shown that the industry conjectural variation may be treated as a function whose properties can be established by non-linear estimation of the price adjustment 253..

RECALL: Chunky Monkey Among Two Flavors With Possible Allergen. A consumer goods company based in London has issued a U.S. recall of two types of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream.. Unilever has recalled Ben & Jerry's Coconut Seven Layer Bar and Chunky Monkey Ice Cream flavors as of April 15, according to an announcement on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration website. The recall is of the 2.4 gallon tubs of the Coconut Seven Layer Bar, and the pint-sized containers of Chunky Monkey.. The decision to pull the products was based on the discovery of potentially undeclared tree nuts on the packaging, which could potentially result in a life-threatening allergic reaction. UPC codes, and other specific information pertaining to the items recalled, can be found on the FDA website.. No reports of illnesses as of yet have been made public. The recalled ice cream brands are commonly found in stores across the country. For more information on the Ben & Jerry's recall, consumers can call 833-236-1237.

Electrical connections between an integrated circuit device formed at one substrate and another integrated circuit device formed at a different substrate can be achieved by stacking one of the integrated circuit devices on top of the other backside-to-frontside to create a ledge at the bottom device. When stacked in this manner, wire bonds can be formed between interconnects at the ledge of the bottom integrated circuit device to interconnects at the top integrated circuit device or at an underlying substrate, such as a package substrate. Alternatively, direct face-to-face flip-chip bonding between two integrated circuit devices can be achieved by forming conductive bumps at one of the devices, and bonding the devices together face-to-face. In yet another embodiment, direct back-to-front bonding between two integrated circuits can be achieved by forming through-wafer vias that include conductive bumps at the back-side of one of the devices and bonding the devices back-to-front. Current practices of forming through-wafer vias include forming a metal plug surrounded by an insulating layer through the substrate of the integrated circuit, whereby the insulating layer isolates the metal plug from the surrounding semiconductor substrate material. During operation a signal is provided between the backside of the integrated circuit's substrate to a frontside of the substrate through the metal plug. Forming metal through-wafer vias such as these can require a number of difficult processes, and create material miss-match stresses that can damage a single crystal substrate, especially when elevated temperature are used subsequent to formation of device structures at the frontside of the integrated circuit. Therefore, a device and method overcoming these issues would be useful.

Intensive cytosine arabinoside therapy in small cell carcinoma of the lung.
Cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) 100 mg/m2/d was given by continuous infusion to patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung in two simultaneous studies. In a first study, 10 patients who had failed prior therapy were treated with Ara-C alone. No responses were seen in these heavily pretreated patients and toxicity was severe. In a second study, Ara-C was added to the known active combination of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and vincristine (CAV) in 25 patients with extensive-stage small cell carcinoma with no prior treatment. Despite a clinical response rate of 52% (28% complete remissions, 24% partial remissions), the median survival was 169 days. This aggressive therapy approach produced substantial toxicity and no therapeutic benefit over previous regimens. Continuous infusion Ara-C (100 mg/m2/d X 3 days) used alone, or combined with CAV is not a useful agent for cell carcinoma of the lung.

The etiology of arthrogryposis (multiple congenital contracture).
In laboratory animals, prenatal contractures have been induced by viruses, neuromuscular blocking agents, toxins, insecticides, hyperthermia, and limb immobilization. In agricultural animals, prenatal contractures are related to pregnant animals foraging on plants containing toxic alkaloids. Epizootics of prenatal contractures in cattle have been related to Akabane viral infections, which can now be prevented by vaccination. Human arthrogryposis (multiple congenital contracture) may occur in any synovial joint in a large variety of combinations. Several lethal syndromes commonly associated with prenatal contractures (Pena Shokeir 1 and 11, Potter's) provide supportive evidence for the following concept of prenatal contracture etiology. Evidence is provided that indicates that the following multiple etiologic factors are related to production of human arthrogryposis: mutagenic agents, mitotic abnormalities, toxic chemicals or drugs, hyperthermia, neuromuscular blocking agents, and mechanical immobilization. These multiple factors mediate their effect via the central nervous system (craniospinal motor neuraxis), motor end-plates, or by primary degeneration of muscle. The resultant effect is loss of muscle mass with imbalance of muscle power at the joints, which provokes a collagenic response (Law of the Connective Tissue). The collagenic response consists of partial replacement of muscle volume and collagenous thickening of the joint capsules. The latter process leads to joint fixation.

Bhattacharya, even when he was most powerful, chose to stay out of the spotlight and had almost managed a successful disappearing act.

Before Robert Vadra, there was Ranjan Bhattacharya, the foster son-in-law of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who reportedly pulled strings from the background while his father-in-law was Prime Minister and managed to evade attention, until Arvind Kejriwal chose to target famous son-in-laws.

Bhattacharya isn't easily described, primarily because he chose to actively shun the spotlight. Married to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's foster-daughter, Namita, Bhattacharya even while occupying his seat of power in 7 Race Course Road maintained a low profile at all times, including while on political tours, something Vadra has found it more difficult to adhere to.

"Robert's flamboyance, his Page 3 habits, put him in the firing line of those gunning for the Gandhi family. Ranjan did not exist for Vajpayee enemies," a political observer was quoted as saying in a Times of India report.

A graduate with economics honours from Delhi's Shri Ram College of Commerce, Bhattacharya reportedly met his wife while studying. He then joined the Oberoi Group and became the a general manager of the group's hotel in Srinagar, a Rediff column on Bhattacharya stated.

Bhattacharya reportedly lost both parents while he was still young and it brought him closer to his wife's family and Vajpayee, who he referred to as 'Bappaji'. His devotion was proven when he toured the nation with his father-in-law voluntarily in 1996, but was careful even then to ensure that none in the BJP could accuse him of mooching off his in-laws.

Appointed an Officer on Special Duty, while his father in law was Prime Minister, Bhattacharya stuck to the shadows but quickly became known as the man to go to in the PMO, but never over stated his power and ever affable, as the Rediff columnist noted:

His detractors complain he has a hand in every deal that goes through these days; from the Maruti settlement to Surjeet Singh Barnala's decision to not import sugar. But most concede that such allegations are part of a smear campaign against his father-in-law. Ranjan is more practical. Tell him this and he'll laugh and come up with three more allegations against him: 'There's also a rumour about me in some telecom scandal as well. How come you haven't heard that one?' he'll ask; and offer you some more coffee at his office in Delhi's Greater Kailash.

He could reportedly be found relaxing with ministers over a drink in the middle of the day, while his father-in-law met with foreign delegations, and at times even had a say in who would become the next finance secretary.

In his memoirs, A Lucknow Boy, former editor of Outlook Vinod Mehta spoke of how the magazine had flagged off various deals in which Bhattacharya reportedly had a more than important role to play:

Topping the list was the Rs 58,000-crore national highways project which had been moving at a frenetic pace because of the extra push being given by the PMO. The first lot of contracts had been awarded to a clutch of seven dubious Malaysian firms. The Rs 20,000-crore Reliance Hirma power project, referred to earlier, was also on Ranjan’s radar. He and the PMO were pushing the Reliance case for a counter guarantee which amounted to a gift for Reliance.

Mehta also wrote of how the PMO had decided to allow a telecom policy, allegedly pushed through by India's biggest industrial houses, which had led to ally Samata Party writing to the Prime Minister seeking to check Bhattacharya's influence.

However, Mehta soon discovered that Bhattacharya was out of bounds when Vajpayee told him in no uncertain words that Bhattacharya's conduct was as "pure as snow". It was followed by a series of IT raids on the proprieter of Outlook.

Bhattacharya's name also featured briefly during reports of the UTI scam and in the sale of government hotels, but the allegations never stuck, at least never long enough to matter, the Times report noted.

Bhattacharya quietly vanished once his father-in-law lost power and faded away from the political limelight. If it weren't for the Niira Radia tapes scandal and Kejriwal, who chose to drag him back into the spotlight, it might just have been a perfect disappearing act.

Conventional thermoplastic resins, for example, vinyl chloride resins such as polyvinyl chloride; acrylic resins such as polymethyl methacrylate; aromatic vinyl resins such as polystyrene and styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer; carbonate resins such as polycarbonate; amide resins such as Nylon 6; polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate; olefin resins such as polypropylene; and polymer alloys of those resins, for example, alloy of styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer and polycarbonate, alloy of .alpha.-methylstyrene-acrylonitrile copolymer and polyvinyl chloride and alloy of polystyrene and polyphenylene oxide are inherently low in impact resistance. In order to improve impact resistance of those resins and alloys thereof, generally there have been widely employed methods for adding, to rubber particles, graft copolymer particles obtained by graft-copolymerizing various monomers. Though the degree of improvement of impact resistance by the addition of the graft copolymer particles is remarkable, for further improving the impact resistance efficiently, there have been made many proposals of improving graft copolymer particles. The methods disclosed in those proposals are a method of lowering Tg of rubber particles (JP-A-2-1763, JP-A-8-100095), a method of regulating gel content of rubber particles, a method of matching particle size and particle size distribution of rubber particles in graft copolymer particles to those of thermoplastic matrix resin (S. Wu, Polymer Engineering and Science, 30,753 (1990)), a method of adjusting compatibility of graft copolymer particles with thermoplastic matrix resin (JP-A-2-251553), etc.
However improvement by those methods have reached their limits, and it is difficult to improve impact resistance more significantly. Also when an adding amount of graft copolymer particles is increased, there is a problem that other characteristics, for example, processability, weather resistance and economic efficiency are lowered.
Meanwhile crazing and shearing yield are an important factor on improvement of impact resistance of a thermoplastic resin. In order to cause such phenomena, stress concentration in a molded article is inevitable. For that purpose, rubber particles are added. Optimizing a size, shape and softness (Tg and degree of crosslinking of rubber) of rubber particles also has a great effect on the stress concentration, and it is anticipated that making a large cavity in the rubber particle previously has greater influence on the stress concentration ("Impact Resistance of Plastics" by Ikuo Narisawa, pp. 131, 155, published by Siguma Shuppan (1994)). However this proposal is hypothetical, and how it is realized is not disclosed.
In order to realize production of hollow graft copolymer particles, the present inventors have made various studies even with respect to different techniques which are not usually studied, and have found that when a technique for hollowing of particles which is known in the field of paints is applied, hollow graft copolymer particles can be prepared and that when such hollow graft copolymer particles are added to a thermoplastic resin, impact resistance can be further improved. Thus the present invention was completed.

The shortage of clean water in many parts of the world is a critical problem. According to the World Health Organization, 1.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water. As a direct consequence 1.6 million people die every year from diarrheal diseases (including cholera) attributable to lack of access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation and 90% of these are children under 5, mostly in developing countries.

Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability (LOHAS) describes an estimated $209 billion U.S. marketplace for goods and services focused on health, the environment, social justice, personal development and sustainable living. The consumers attracted to this market represent a sizable group in this country.

The problem of e-waste: Between the breakneck pace of technological progress and our voracious appetite for gadgets, we're accumulating piles of obsolete computers, cell phones, and other electronic junk. This stuff is hard to dispose of because it's full of many different materials and tends to contain toxins like mercury, lead, and arsenic. This junk is often shipped overseas where it's "recycled" with very little oversight and becomes an environmental and public health disaster.

Urban agriculture is the practice of cultivating, processing and distributing food in, or around a village, town or city. Social benefits that have emerged from urban agricultural practices are; better health and nutrition, increased income, employment, food security within the household, and community social life.

What would you give for someone or something to helps you find safe, healthy, and sustainable products while you shop? How about simply scanning the barcode of the product and immediately see detailed ratings for health, environment and social responsibility for more than 50,000 products and companies.

What chemicals are in your baby shampoo? Was sweatshop labor used to make your t-shirt? What products are the best, and what products should you avoid?
Increasingly, you want to know about the impacts of the products you buy. On your health. On the environment. On society. But unless you’ve got a Ph.D, it is almost impossible to find out the impacts of the products you buy. Until now…

Almost all consumer electronics (mobile phones, computers, monitors, printers, etc.) contain toxic materials such as lead, mercury, arsenic and a broad variety of other materials that pose a threat to the environment and health. The challenge is to extend device usage to end-of-life, safely mine existing eWaste for materials, and design new devices with planned reclamation using reclaimed materials where possible.

Finding a convenient, healthy snack can be difficult in workplaces and schools where fruit trees are long gone and the best on offer now comes from a vending machine stuffed with junk. In this troubled economic times, many schools are forced to shut down their cafeteria services and replace them with rows of vending machines.

In the US alone, consumers spent hundreds of billions of dollars in fast food alone. Modern consumers have an ambivalent relationship (characterized by guilt) with fast food, particularly in relation to children. This guilt is projected onto processed food, where bizarre tales of contamination and lax standards are widely believed. Trans fats which are commonly found in fast food have been shown in many tests to have a negative health effect on the body. Excessive calories are another issue with fast food. A regular meal at McDonald's consists of a Big Mac, large fries, and a large Coca-Cola drink amounting to 1430 calories

The local food movement in which sustainable food production, processing, distribution, and consumption is integrated to enhance the economic, environmental and social health of a particular place and is considered to be a part of a broader sustainability movement. Urban farming — the art of growing vegetables in cities has become increasingly trendy in recent years, led by health-conscious foodies coveting just-picked produce, as well as hipsters who dig the roll-your-own vibe.

Q:

History of the demise of Matrox from the world of 3D graphics cards

In the last century, a brand of video cards that rhymed with quality, Matrox, was very popular and the choice for professional applications and to some extent for 3D gaming.
The benefits of upgrading your computer with a Matrox Millenium were instantly visible, a very fast desktop on Windows, better-balanced colors, custom drivers for professional applications such as AutoCAD and so on.
At the mid-90s, 3D cards were all the rage and they managed to release an affordable, yet effective card for gaming, the Matrox Mystique.
Sometime after, they released (what I think) their best range of cards: the Matrox G200, followed by the Matrox G400. These back then were a popular choice as out of the box they provided dual screen, TV output, and accelerated video.
Back then, NVidia and ATI did exist but weren't as ubiquitous as they are now. Today, Matrox is mostly to be found in niche markets such as 'many displays' cards, the typical product you'll find used by public places with many displays such as airports
What happened back then that such a popular brand vanished over time?

A:

The 3DFX Voodoo graphics chip (1996) was superior to anything else at the time for 3D. The Matrox Mystique (1996) was a fine card, good 3D and 2D but not as good as the Voodoo for 3D (the Voodoo lacked 2D).
Later, the Nvidia RIVA 128 (1997) and ATI 3D Rage Pro (1997) competed with the Voodoo line, and Matrox was left behind.
The Millennium G400 (1999) was another fine card, ahead of its time with Environment Mapped Bump Mapping (EMBM) but at the time this feature was not well supported by the industry. The ATI Radeon 7200 (2000), Nvidia GeForce 2 GTS (2000), and 3dfx Voodoo 5 (2000) arrived later with the same feature but better performance and industry support.
The ultimate demise of Matrox in the consumer market came with the short-lived Parhelia (2002):

As had happened with previous Matrox products, the Parhelia was
  released just before competing companies released cards that
  completely outperformed it. In this case it was the ATI Radeon 9700,
  released only a few months later. The Parhelia remained a niche
  product, and was Matrox's last major effort to sell into the consumer
  market.

A:

I think 3D (read: gaming) just wasn't their target market.
The thing about Matrox cards was that they were always a bit more expensive, targeted at workstations and "high reliability" environments such as control rooms, security monitoring, emergency dispatch, power grid, traffic and light control, process automation and medical sector. Really any place that has a "reliability component" which requires a lengthy testing and validation process and where components can't fail.
AMD/ATi and nVidia didn't target this market in their 3D components because history has shown that they had no problem releasing cards that sounded like a vacuum cleaner and needed a ridiculously powered power supply. Matrox couldn't release these kinds of things and maintain their standing for reliability. It isn't to say that Matrox couldn't have (it could possible cheapen their brand image) nor is it to say that AMD/ATi and nVidia didn't release more reliable cards (they have), but the real cutting edge 3D gaming stuff is pushing the limits without regard for failure.
As for the turning point in the late 90's for "king of the hill" 3D GPUs, the thing that really separated the cards at the time was color depth and various 3D features (filtering, etc.). 3Dfx was the top, but ATi and nVidia ate their lunch simply by offering more features. I recall that reviews (e.g. Maximum PC) would state how Unreal looked so much better with the nVidia Riva TNT's 32-bit color in comparison to 3Dfx's 16-bit.
For what it's worth, the problem with 3Dfx and a bit of its downfall was that the TNT was a similar cost all-in-one solution which had equivalent performance to the 3Dfx Voodoo2. Yes, the Voodoo3 was an answer to that as a faster all-in-one card, but the problem is that it used the same chipset as the older Voodoo2. It competed on performance, but there were no new features. I don't recall enough of 3Dfx's history, but it might simply be when they started addressing color depth and other things, they had already lost the race. It is possible that they had been focusing too much their work with Sega as they were supposed to be the chipset for the Dreamcast, but that deal fell through as Sega went with NEC's PowerVR in the end.

This is a handmade card showing the illusion of an antique golden-silver disk with Lapis Lazuli inlays. There are four boars, many swans, and 4 hidden faces to discover. Inside the card there is a full colour inlay and an extra inlay with the following text: My Celtic Art Project. This is my contribution to my ‘Who are the Celts?’ course at Oxford Department for Continuing Education, week 5 ‘Make your Own Celtic Art’ (2017). At the end of a demanding week of studying participants were challenged to make their own Celtic art. I used Golden/Silver ink-pens, an ordinary Bic blue pen, art paper, a protector, and many rulers to create an illusion of a golden plate decorated with silver and Lapis Lazuli boars. Notice the boars, hidden faces, and many swans.. © by Paula Kuitenbrouwer. This engaging card comes in protective cellophane, a name card, and a seal sticker. All in all this is an art project card that will entertain its (new) owner and it leaves plenty of room for a handwritten text.

Egara Tenjin Shrine

, is a Shinto shrine in Kamakura. Having been founded according to legend by an unknown priest in 1104, it is one of the few extant religious institutions in the area to predate the advent of Minamoto no Yoritomo, who arrived here in 1181. Like all other Tenjin shrines in Japan, it enshrines the spirit of famous scholar and politician Sugawara no Michizane under the name Tenjin. For this reason, the kami is believed to be a protector of intellectual pursuits.

Having been unjustly sent into exile, where he died, Michizane was deified and enshrined to pacify his soul, which was believed to be angry as a consequence. Numerous calamities that followed his death validated this belief.

The shrine, described as "in bad shape" a century ago by Iso Mutsu,<ref>Iso Mutsu. Kamakura: Fact and Legend', Tuttle Publishing (1995/06) </ref> has been completely rebuilt and consists of an oratory (haiden) and of a sacrarium (honden''). Both are painted in the traditional Shinto vermilion color.

Hydraulic Oil Cleanliness: A Key to N/C Machine Maintenance

High uptime on numerical control (N/C) machining centers is the result of correcting any condition that may ultimately lead to some component failure. This requires an intimate knowledge of the machine hydraulic system and components, and that rare sense of what is right (or wrong) in the entire operation of a machine. A measurement of oil cleanliness can be most helpful.

A remarkable increase of N/C machines in manufacturing industries presents a challenge to develop personnel for proper care of these installations. Development of this skill in machine maintenance is the users' achievement.

Present day machines, with improved components and hydraulic systems, are less sensitive to hydraulic problems. Several years of experience has provided technical knowledge in the art. This information can be passed on by a machine builder to a user, or from one user to another, in symposiums such as this.

Nevio Marasović

Nevio Marasović (born 7 July  1983) is a Croatian film director and screenwriter. He is also a commercial director.

Biography

Film career 

Made his first feature film called The Computer Repairment at the age of sixteen.

Graduated film directing at the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Zagreb.
In 2005 he made a ghost commercial “Durex Lunch” which won numerous awards at different advertising festivals. “Lunch” also became an internet meme in the following years.

In 2010 Marasović wrote and directed his feature film The Show Must Go On, set in near-future Zagreb, seven years after the accession of Croatia to the EU, in which there are two depictions - one of the outside world, i.e. the third world war between the EU and unnamed countries, and the other of housemates in a Big Brother-like TV reality show, who are unaware that during their stay in the house a world war has started and who the main character, the producer of the show, decides not to inform, in order to give the viewers a view of the carefree world that once existed before the war broke out.

The Show Must Go On received Golden Arena for Best Screenplay, Golden Arena for the Best Special Effects, Best Newcomer award and the Critic’s Choice Movie of the Year award at the Pula Film Festival, Croatia’s national film festival.

The same year Marasović made a TV comedy show called Instruktor for Croatia's RTL television.
Along with a Croatian actor Stjepan Perić, Marasović was Instruktor'''s author and writer.

Browse through DLA Piper’s extensive guide to data regulations and enforcement around the world and it’s clear that the United States stands out compared with more robust protections in places like Canada and Europe. (Elsewhere, protections are lesser or nonexistent.) Many European countries have central agencies dedicated to data protection. In France, individuals must give their consent before a data broker can distribute his or her data. In the United Kingdom, websites have to notify visitors of data-tracking software. Many European countries require data brokers to give individuals the opportunity to review their data profiles, and to show them how to access, change, remove, or otherwise object to the data that has been collected.

There is some dissonance to the fact that data protections in the U.S. are so slim compared with other regulations in other nations. Culturally, Americans prize the right to privacy. And there are U.S. sectors, like health care, where protecting personal data is paramount. But Americans don't even know which pieces of their personal data is swirling around out there. Your name, age, past addresses, political party enrollment, whether you own a home—sure, you might expect that kind of stuff is to be shared by marketers and others who deal in data. But data brokers specialize in inference, too, so they can figure out all kinds of super-specific details about who you are and how you live.

"For example, a data broker might infer that an individual with a boating license has an interest in boating, that a consumer has a technology interest based on the purchase of a Wired magazine subscription, or that a consumer who has bought two Ford cars has loyalty to that brand," wrote the Federal Trade Commission in a report on Big Data this week.

The FTC has been pushing for Congress to do something about free wheeling data brokers for the better part of the last decade. All this data collection is happening without consumer consent, and some the profiling that seems innocuous is actually harmful, the commission argues.

One person profiled as low-income might be inundated with sub-prime mortgage offers. Another person profiled as a motorcyclist might be flagged by insurance companies for higher rates. The categories into which consumers are sorted are incredibly detailed, and they’re based on a mix of government data (like the political donations you made), publicly available data (like the relationship status on your Facebook profile), and commercial data (like how Aquafresh Extreme Clean is your favorite brand of toothpaste, a nugget of data that’s linked to you because you swiped your CVS rewards card before paying).

Big data knows your net worth. It knows that you have a dog. It knows when you’re most likely to use a coupon. It knows your favorite brand of detergent. It knows your dress size. It knows about your last speeding ticket, and when you got the oil changed. It knows you have a hunting license. It knows whether you're pregnant—and often before you have a chance to share the news. The New York Times in 2012 told the alarming story of a teenager whose father angrily complained to Target for sending his young daughter promotional mailings for cribs and baby clothes. It later turned out the girl was pregnant, just as her data profile predicted. She simply hadn’t told her parents yet.

Advanced retinoblastoma in Malaysian children.
Twenty children with retinoblastoma are reviewed who were treated at the University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur over a 10-year-period. They constitute 6.6% of childhood malignancies and without exception all presented with advanced disease. Hereditary cases were notably absent in the the series probably because past cases have almost invariably succumbed without an opportunity to transmit the gene. With enucleation and radiotherapy six of the patients have survived from 2 to 12 years. The addition of vincristine and cyclophosphamide has not been associated with improved survival.

DavolView In iTunes. To preview a song, mouse over the title and click Play. Open iTunes to buy and download music.. Biography. New age composer/keyboardist Davol had an early interest in music, receiving classical piano training as a child and studying jazz and classical harpsichord in college. Electronic music also interested him, and Davol began writing and recording his own pieces as a hobby while he studied microbiology. Some of the tapes he passed out to friends made their way to Silver Wave Records, who offered Davol a recording contract. In 1989, he released his debut album, Mystic Waves, and also received his Ph.D. in microbiology. Though he continued to write and record music, including his 1992 album The Nature of the Beast, Davol worked as a medical researcher until 1996, when he began writing music for multimedia along with his new age works. His fourth album, Open Book, was released in 1999. ~ Heather Phares

Survivance Among Social Impact Games. AbstractStudying social impact games can result in many outcomes, such as awareness or action around a social issue. Research can help inform best practices for the design process, strategies for reaching players, game mechanics for aligning with social impact outcomes, and methods for identifying the impact of the game on players and the wider community. One such research project is Survivance ()—a social impact game that addresses healing from intergenerational historical trauma experienced by Indigenous communities. Survivance was designed collaboratively with Indigenous game designer/researcher Elizabeth LaPensée and the non-profit organization Wisdom of the Elders, Inc. This paper seeks to contextualize the area of social impact games within the Games for Change movement, compare perspectives on social impact games, and create connections and comparisons with Survivance..

Elsas and Lennon on September 28, 1974. Today marks the 30th anniversary etched in the minds of Beatles fans around the world. John Lennon was murdered outside of his apartment building, The Dakota, overlooking Central Park.. “There was no precedent to any of this,” Veteran New York DJ Dennis Elsas reflects. “The assassination of a rock star, that was totally new.”. Elsas, six years earlier, had what many consider the definitive radio interview with Lennon. Elsas, working at the time for WNEW-FM, spoke with Lennon for two hours that Saturday afternoon. You can hear portions of that famous interview on Elsas’ website.. The legendary DJ for more than a decade has been an afternoon fixture at Fordham University’s WFUV (90.7 FM). He recalls for FishbowlNY that fateful night when the WNEW on-air staff and listeners mourned as one for the loss of the music and goodwill giant.

The industry is abuzz because of Oracle’s tightening on licensing for Sun products. (Read the press release from Oracle about their Sun acquisition.) Indeed, several of our own clients are pretty upset about the heavy-handed push by Oracle to force users of Sun products into expensive license purchases, especially for those that relied heavily on Sun’s relatively open licenses on some products, such as those for Sun Directory Server (DSEE) and Sun OpenSSO.. Novell has made a great move: If you own licenses for Sun software, such as Sun IM, you can swap those licenses, for free, for Novell licenses. All you pay is maintenance.. Smart move.. The real fear for many of our clients, and for you in the field, is not just the current upfront costs, but the long-term costs associated with being aligned with Oracle products.. Has Oracle pretty much destroyed the value of Sun? And are they destroying the market they acquired with the Sun purchase with heavy handed tactics?

Effect of anti-CD4 antibody treatment on inflammatory arthritis in MRL-lpr/lpr mice.
MRL-lpr/lpr mice develop an inflammatory arthritis in association with other manifestations of autoimmunity. Although a variety of immune cell disturbances have been described in these mice, the relationship of these abnormalities to the pathogenesis of arthritis has not yet been determined; the role of T cells is especially unclear since synovial hypertrophy and joint erosions have been noted in some studies in the absence of a significant T cell infiltrate. Therefore, to determine if T cells are required for arthritis in MRL-lpr/lpr mice, we evaluated the effects of prolonged treatment with a monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody. Knee joints from treated mice had markedly reduced arthritis compared to saline-treated control animals as measured by the degree of synovial hypertrophy and inflammation. Nephritis in these mice was concomitantly reduced. In contrast, rheumatoid factor levels were not affected by CD4+ cell depletion, despite significant effects on anti-DNA. These results indicate that in MRL-lpr/lpr mice anti-CD4 therapy can inhibit arthritis, suggesting an important role of T cells in the pathogenesis of this lesion.

A study to examine the attitudes, knowledge, and utilization of CAM by primary care professional in West Texas.
This study examined the attitudes, knowledge, and utilization of CAM among primary care providers at two campuses of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC). A cross-sectional study design and a convenient sampling method were used. This study employed the questionnaire adapted from the Wahner-Roedler's study to survey participants in TTUHSC. Primary survey collection was conducted at the two campuses where all Family Medicine healthcare professionals were recruited. We measured participants' knowledge of, their familiarity and experience with, their attitudes towards and utilization of CAM. Of the 69 respondents, more than half (56.5%) were female and younger than 36 years. Overall, our study revealed a positive attitude towards CAM. More than 60% of the providers would like to refer a patient to a CAM practitioner and about 75% of them believed that incorporation of CAM therapies into the practice would have a positive impact. Providers were most familiar with and felt most comfortable counseling their patients about massage therapy and St. John's Wort among all CAM modalities. About 70% of the participants believed that the institution should offer proven CAM therapies to patients. This study provides some preliminary findings that may lead to further exploration of healthcare professional's attitudes towards CAM.

Estrogen replacement has been found to reduce the risk of heart disease by as much as 50% in postmenopausal females. The mechanism of action of this cardioprotective effect of estrogen, however, is not clear. The use of replacement hormones has recently been associated with the enhancement of endogenous fibrinolytic potential, i.e., blood thinning factors. This enhanced fibrinolytic potential may contribute to the inverse relation between hormonal replacement and coronary heart disease. These effects are consistent whether oral estrogen monotherapy, estrogen plus progesterone or transdermal estradermal estradiol is administered. For study purposes, we will randomize each woman to take one month of either oral or transdermal estrogen or placebo. The primary goal is to evaluate the effects of estrogen on blood thinning and clotting factors (i.e.tPA antigen, PAI-1 antigen D-dimer, von Willebrand factor, and fibrinogen). Our second goal will be to assess the effects of using 2 different routes of hormonal replacement (oral and transdermal estrogen) on fibrinolytic and hemostatic potential in postmenopausal women. The third goal is to determine the fibrinogen phenotype and acute phase reactants that are found after estrogen therapy.

Primaquine: its effect on cellular immune response of normal rhesus monkeys.
The effect of primaquine on the cellular immune responses (lymphocyte subpopulations and their proliferative responses with PHA, Con-A and LPS, and phagocytosis by monocytes) of normal rhesus monkeys was studied under both in-vivo and in-vitro conditions. When the lymphocytes and monocytes from normal animals were treated in-vitro with primaquine, at concentration normally attainable during therapy, a significant inhibition in blastogenic response of lymphocytes and phagocytic capacity of monocytes was noticed after 4 hours of treatment. In contrast, the in-vivo effect of primaquine treatment on these cells was innocuous. From this study it is clear that the primaquine does not act as an immunosuppresant and can be given safely to any type of malaria patient.

Nanofilled Resin Composite Properties and Clinical Performance: A Review.
The aim of this review was to compile recent evidence related to nanofilled resin composite materials regarding the properties and clinical performance. Special attention was given to mechanical properties, such as strength, hardness, abrasive wear, water sorption, and solubility. The clinical performance of nanocomposite materials compared with hybrid resin composites was also addressed in terms of retention and success rates, marginal adaptation, color match, and surface roughness. A search of English peer-reviewed dental literature (2003-2017) from PubMed and MEDLINE databases was conducted using the terms "nanocomposites" or "nanofilled resin composite" and "clinical evaluation." The list was screened, and 82 papers that were relevant to the objectives of this work were included in the review. Mechanical properties of nanocomposites are generally comparable to those of hybrid composites but higher than microfilled composites. Nanocomposites presented lower abrasive wear than hybrids but higher sorption values. Their clinical performance was comparable to that of hybrid composites.

Importance of a thriving agricultural sector needs to be acknowledged, says Farmers’ Union of Wales The importance of a thriving agricultural sector needs to be acknowledged, the Farmers’ Union of Wales has said. The comments were made during a farm visit by Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney Assembly Member Dawn Bowden as part of the FUW’s #FarmingMatters campaign. --> --> Rhymney Valley beef and sheep farmer Brian Bowen opened the doors to his Pencoedcae farm the Labour AM and pressed on her the importance of farming to Wales – particularly in light of uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Mr Bowen, who is the FUW’s Policy Delegate for South Wales, farms 2,000 breeding ewes and around 150 suckler cows on 1,250 acres of rented and owned land at Princetown, Tredegar, along with his father, mother and his son. --> --> Mr Bowen said: “Farm businesses, and family farms in particular, are an essential part of the economic, social, and cultural fabric of Wales. “Welsh food production sustains tens of thousands of other businesses – from upstream businesses such as feed merchants, agricultural contractors and engineers, to downstream businesses such as hauliers, processors and retailers. --> --> “Farmers are an exceptional conduit for money, so if their businesses are thriving they reinvest and this, in turn, brings wealth to second and third sector businesses and the wider rural economy.” Farmers and FUW representatives also stressed that irrespective of what trade deals are in place post-Brexit, within the UK, Welsh farmers will have to compete against their counterparts in other devolved regions. --> -->

Mr Bowen added: “It is critical that everyone understands just how much farming matters and I would like to thank the businesses who came to join us here and echoed that sentiment.

“Following the downturn in agriculture over recent times and across almost all sectors, it is critical that we acknowledge the importance of a thriving agricultural sector on the economy – both locally and much further afield.”

According to the FUW, around 60,000 people are employed on farm holdings in Wales, in addition to the thousands employed in businesses reliant on agriculture.

“The wider contributions to our economy are also well documented, for example, in terms of tourism, while agriculture has been acknowledged as the single most significant contributor to an estimated £1.9 billion worth of wildlife based activity in Wales per annum (Mabis, 2007), the Welsh countryside, managed by farmers, provides the backdrop for the tourism industry worth over £2.5 Billion,” said Mr Bowen.

A variety of local businesses and common land associations also attended the visit. These included John Richards of The Prince of Wales pub, Price Farm Supplies, T Alun Jones Machinery, Neil Davies of PMR, Bowketts Feeds, Rees Agri, Clee Tompkinson and Francis Estate Agents, Land Agent Chris Smith, Llangynidr Commons Secretary Colin Greeves, and Merthyr Gelligaer Commons Chairman Huw Williams.

Dawn Bowden, Welsh Labour Assembly Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney said: “I am grateful to the FUW for inviting me to Pencoedcae Farm to meet with farmers and representatives of local business which are heavily reliant on farming.

“It was helpful to hear at first hand the challenges facing the farming industry, particularly in the context of the many uncertainties surrounding Brexit. The discussions brought home in very clear terms that “farming matters”, and I look forward to working with organisations like the FUW, alongside farmers and businesses in my constituency as we face the challenges ahead.”

The gowns were an interpretation of a garden whose trellised gates were placed along the model form and cinched around the waist. Murad worked lampshade skirts into flirty cocktail dresses and grand evening gowns, all lavishly embroidered to evoke garden lattices and flowers. The palette was dominated by powdery pastels in sugared almond shades.. One of the more whimsical and seductive looks was a flowing greige chiffon gown with an embroidered top and matching cape sparkling with silver crystals.

Attachment to Physical Media

If you browse a web design gallery or two you’ll notice a pattern—something that the design of my own site shares as well. The visuals of many sites recreate physical media. This is done by using paper textures for backgrounds, grungy or handwritten fonts, paper edges, wrapping labels, paint strokes, cardboard textures and so on. Even though the design is that of a website, which only exists in the digital world, the designer chooses to utilize familiar visuals of the physical realm.

This is a trend that appears to be growing. Look around on CSS galleries and you’ll see a lot of such techniques in use. Websites are starting to feel like they’re made out of paper, with painted headers and printed letters. The inspiration behind this trend is clear. The physical media looks and feels good, and we’re all familiar with it. It’s comforting and pleasing to see the nuances of that media on the screen.

But…I’m not convinced that this trend is a right direction for web design. You see, while the trend is aesthetically pleasing, the idea behind it closes off some great opportunities for the designer.

By recreating the physical media, you’re not only recreating something that already exists—and so is not new or innovative—you’re setting limits on your own creativity, limits imposed by an older media. The computer screen is free from the many restrictions of paper. There is no limit to what color you want to use or how thin a line you wish to depict (limited only by the pixel density). Things don’t have to be static on a computer screen. Sure, digital images still have their limitations, but these are not the same limitations of physical paper, and the opportunities for creating something new and unique are far greater.

When you follow the trend of recreating the physical media on the digital screen, you’re not only copying its strengths, you’re copying its flaws. The digital screen is an evolution of paper, and yet here we are going back, trying to recreate what we’ve had before. Sure, the old media like paper has character—indeed, the flaws also help make it what it is—but there is absolutely no reason why digital should lack character as well, after all, it’s up to the designer to create it.

So my thought really is this: when you find yourself working on a new design and are making it look like the physical media—paper, paint, dirt, wood, etc.— why not take a step back and ask yourself if this design can be made differently. Can you utilize the full potential of the digital medium that your website lives in by creating a look that is unique? Why submit to the limitations of an older media? Can you design something that we haven’t seen before? If you can, why not do it?

An autopsy case of bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma-associated cerebral hemorrhage.
The autopsy findings of a 30-year-old woman who died of cerebral hemorrhage induced by bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma are presented. The cerebral hemorrhage was shown on the left cerebral hemisphere widely. Her both adrenal glands were severe swelling, and their parenchyma was occupied by a dark red-brown tumorous positive for chromogranin A. The serum catecholamine and their metabolite, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) levels were markedly high. Furthermore, cardiac hypertrophy and sclerosis of the arteries of various organs had progressed, suggesting an influence of persistent endocrinal hypertension. The measurement of serum VMA level was thought to be valuable for a postmortem diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma may have excessively secreted catecholamine and subsequently caused secondary hypertension, leading to cerebral hemorrhage.

Q:

Use single ResourceDictionary for multiple themes WPF

I have a control that has a lot of themes and each theme is represented by a ResourceDictionary. The problem is that the dictionaries are almost identical and they differ only in the beggining where I have declared color brushes, for example:
<SolidColorBrush x:Key="FirstRd1" Color="#3F555555" />
<SolidColorBrush x:Key="SecondRd1" Color="#00000000" />
<SolidColorBrush x:Key="ThirdRd1" Color="#FF333333" />
<SolidColorBrush x:Key="FourthRd1" Color="#FF000000" />

These brushes (and other xaml objects for style) are used here and there on the same place, like this:
 <!-- ResourceDictionary 1 -->
 <Border CornerRadius="4"
         Margin="0, 0, 0, 0" 
         BorderThickness="1"
         BorderBrush="{StaticResource FirstRd1}">
         <!-- Some content -->
 </Border>

 <!-- ResourceDictionary 2 -->
 <Border CornerRadius="4"
         Margin="0, 0, 0, 0" 
         BorderThickness="1"
         BorderBrush="{StaticResource FirstRd2}">
         <!-- Some content -->
 </Border>

How to move the same elements with different brush like above in a single file? There are aslo other elements that do not depend on the brushes, but they are nested or have nested dependant controls. What will be the best solution in this situation, as I do not want to edit 15+ files for a single dummy change?

A:

You can merge resource dictionaries.  Declare your common stuff in one file, then for the differentiated parts make each one it's own file and merge it with the common file.

We propose something analogous, but for the much more challenging case of an image collection: We propose to automatically develop a visual vocabulary by breaking images into n × n tiles and deriving key tiles ("ViVos") "ViVos" achieve high classification accuracy (up to 83 %for a nine-class problem on feline retinal images). More importantly, qualitatively, our "ViVos" do an excellent job as "visual vocabulary terms": they have biological meaning, as corroborated by domain experts; they help spot characteristic regions of images, exactly like text vocabulary terms do for documents; and they highlight the differences between pairs of images..

Anticarcinogenic activity of quinacrine in the rat mammary gland.
Mammary carcinogenesis studies were conducted to determine the chemopreventive activity of quinacrine, an antimalarial drug which suppresses the production of arachidonic acid from phospholipid through inhibition of phospholipase A2. Beginning 1 week after a single i.v. dose of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a semi-purified diet supplemented with 0 or 75 mg quinacrine/kg diet. Quinacrine reduced cancer incidence and carcinoma multiplicity in rats administered 20 mg MNU/kg body wt, but had no inhibitory activity in rats treated with 50 mg MNU/kg. These data suggest that pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism in addition to cyclooxygenase present useful targets for mammary cancer chemoprevention. However, the chemopreventive activity of quinacrine may be limited by toxicity.

In Vertex and Vortex- A tectonics of Section, Jennifer Bloomer described the convergence of inscription and incision as the moment when a section is born. The collision of these two actions is what is conventionally called the poche, which is referred to by Bloomer as the floaters. It is described as a thin layer of liquid substance. A black dot that lies in between the brain and the object observed. To inscribe is to capture a situation by giving it a visual presence. It is a trace, a memory, a description in between the viewer and the spatial narrative beyond. To incise is to discover the unknown of the beyond. It is a physical act, a temporal state of reading and understanding. Furthermore, the notion of gravity and orientation must be considered in the making of a section. She argued that a plan divorced from gravity is a section through transparency, that "a plan is a section which demands the presence of gravity". It must be connected to the world of tension and compression..

Helix Herringbone Hat. This pattern was originally published for Club Dragonfly in November 2012. The copyright has now reverted back to me, and I am happy to share it with you. Enjoy!. I’ve always felt that the variegated yarns made by Dragonfly Fibers cry out to be worked in patterns that will pool the color families. When making a hat, the trick is to find a stitch pattern that uses up just the right amount of yarn over the number of stitches that fits your head.. The Horizontal Herringbone Stitch by Barbara Walker creates an attractive, strong horizontal motif, and eats up just the right amount of yarn to pool the colors. Using a helix knitting technique allows you to have an uninterrupted flow from beginning to end.. Circumference: 18 inches; Height: 8.5 inches from cast-on to bind off. Main color - Thisbe (solid), about 2 oz (235 yds). Contrasting color - Pyramus (variegated), about 1 oz (115 yds)

For years I have fled from a nameless figure. that first blossomed in water on an unsuspecting page,. was built unknowingly on a canvas in oils,. leaked from the tip of a chortling fountain pen,. and sketched in wandering shades of flower-grey.. A hand, taken from a poet whose lamp still burned into the night. A pair of eyes, jewels hidden behind fractured glasses. Hair, raven-black and ruffled in the direction of the wind. A nose, flawless white, from a marble sculpture in the park. Lips, pale rosy and stolen in the middle of song. A back, slightly bent beneath the burden of time. Two feet wrapped in weary brown shoes that walked the whole way.. For years I have fled from a nameless figure. For years I have learnt by heart the essence of his being. For years I have whispered in secret an unknown identity. For years I have yearned for his soundless voice.. And then, he came to me.. © 2010

I want to calculate percentage of ID having Var1 value as 8 on every day.
I have tried this but it couldn't work.
SELECT
  COUNT( ID) AS ID, 
  ((COUNT( Var1) / (COUNT( ID) )) * 100 ) AS percentage
FROM
  Table1 
WHERE Var1=8
GROUP BY
  Date(Date);

A:

I would suggest writing this as:
SELECT Date(Date), SUM(Var1 = 8) AS ID, 
       AVG(Var1 = 8) * 100 AS percentage
FROM Table1 
GROUP BY Date(Date);

This uses a MySQL shortcut that allows boolean values to be treated as numbers in a numeric context.



In something we feel is long overdue, the era of the Internet Cat is set to be immortalized in a new exhibition at the New York Museum of Moving Image, reports Racked. Titled "How Cats Took Over the Internet," the exhibition will open on August 7th. Racked also says that Internet cats "maybe-definitely don't deserve" this esteemed honor which, pshhhhh.. It sounds pretty glorious to us, with the entire space dedicated to our viral feline heros, hilarious memes, and go-to cat reaction gifs, as well as a timeline of Internet Cat history. There will also be an entire room with "cat videos played on continuous loop," which is probably where you'll be able to find us in deep, meditative thought until January 31, 2016, when the exhibition closes.. Is it too late for this nomination?

Enhancing Primary School Children's Knowledge of Online Safety and Risks with the CATZ Cooperative Cross-Age Teaching Intervention: Results from a Pilot Study.
Children are heavy users of the Internet and prior studies have shown that many of them lack a good understanding of the risks of doing so and how to avoid them. This study examined if the cross-age teaching zone (CATZ) intervention could help children acquire important knowledge of online risks and safety. It allowed older students to act as CATZ tutors to design and deliver a lesson to younger schoolmates (tutees), using content material about online risks and safety provided by adults. Students in Year 6 (mean age = 11.5 years) were randomly assigned to act as either CATZ tutors (n = 100) or age-matched controls (n = 46) and students in Year 4 (mean age = 9.5 years) acted as either CATZ tutees (n = 117) or age-matched controls (n = 28) (total N = 291). CATZ tutors, but not matched controls scored significantly higher on objective measures of knowledge of both online risks and safety, and CATZ tutees, but not matched controls did so for online safety. Effect sizes were moderate or large. CATZ was highly acceptable to participants. The results suggest that CATZ is a viable way to help school students learn about online dangers and how to avoid them.

A model for persistent infection with Epstein-Barr virus: the stealth virus of human B cells.
Most adult humans are infected benignly and for life with the herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus. EBV has been a focus of research because of its status as a candidate tumor virus for a number of lymphomas and carcinomas. In vitro EBV has the ability to establish a latent infection in proliferating B lymphoblasts. This is the only system available for studying human herpesvirus latency in culture and has been extremely useful for elucidating how EBV promotes cellular growth. However, to understand how EBV survives in the healthy host and what goes awry, leading to disease, it is essential to know how EBV establishes and maintains a persistent infection in vivo. Early studies on the mechanism of EBV persistence produced inconclusive and often contradictory results because the techniques available were crude and insensitive. Recent advances in PCR technology and the application of sophisticated cell fractionation techniques have now provided new insights into the behavior of the virus. Most dramatically it has been shown that EBV in vivo does not establish latency in a proliferating lymphoblast, but in a resting memory B cell. The contrasting behaviors of being able to establish a latent infection in proliferating B blasts and resting memory B cells can be resolved in terms of a model where EBV performs its complete life cycle in B lymphocytes. The virus achieves this not by disrupting normal B cell biology but by using it.

Effect of hesperidin on the pharmacokinetics of CPT-11 and its active metabolite SN-38 by regulating hepatic Mrp2 in rats.
The usage of irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11) chemotherapy is hindered by its dose-limiting diarrhea which appears to be associated with the intestinal exposure to SN-38, the active metabolite of CPT-11. Hesperidin, a safe and natural food ingredient flavonoid, exhibits various biological properties. Accumulated evidence showed that the regulatory effect of hesperidin on the expression of Mrp2 in the liver may be one of the critical factors controlling the biliary excretion of SN-38. This study examined the effect of hesperidin on the pharmacokinetics of CPT-11 and SN-38 as well as the regulatory effect on the hepatic expression of Mrp2. Compared with the control group, the AUC5-t was increased to 115% of CPT-11 and 122% of SN-38; the CL was decreased to 87% for CPT-11; the tissue concentration was increased in the liver, kidney and colon; and the accumulated biliary excretion was significantly decreased to 77% for CPT-11 and 76% for SN-38 in hesperidin-treated rats. Furthermore, the expression of Mrp2 in the liver was significantly decreased to 37% in the hesperidin-treated rats compared with that of the control group. These results indicate that oral administration of hesperidin significantly increased the AUC5-t and reduced the clearance of CPT-11 and SN-38, possibly by decreasing the hepatic expression of Mrp2, and thus inhibiting the biliary excretion of CPT-11 and SN-38. The results from this present study suggest that hesperidin may reduce the exposure of CPT-11 and SN-38 in the intestine by reducing the amount of biliary excretion of CPT-11 and SN-38.

NEW DELHI: A day after the government announced dismal economic growth numbers, a survey on Friday showed steady expansion of India's manufacturing sector during May, raising hopes that the industrial slowdown may stabilise in the coming months.. The HSBC manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, declined marginally to 54.8 in May from 54.9 in April. The reading for India in the widely-followed survey has stayed above 50, which separates growth from contraction, for a little over three years.

Intraventricular Meningiomas: A Series of 42 Patients at a Single Institution and Literature Review.
Primary intraventricular meningiomas (IVMs) make up 0.5%-5% of all intracranial meningiomas and represent one of the most challenging lesions in neurosurgery. Between 1990 and 2013, 42 patients (30 female, 12 male; mean age, 43.6 years) underwent resection of their IVM. The removal was performed by a posterior parietal approach in 19 of the 40 lateral ventricle tumors, and 1 third ventricle meningioma. The transcallosal approach was used for 3 meningiomas, and patients with other lesions underwent temporal (7 cases) and temporoparietal approaches (12 patients), respectively. The most common presenting signs were increased intracranial pressure (83.3%), visual impairment (78.6%) and cognitive changes (50%). Forty lesions (95.2%) arose in the lateral ventricles, and 2 (4.8%) in the third ventricle, ranging in size from 3 to 10 cm. Total removal was achieved in 39 cases and the pathology report disclosed World Health Organization grade I lesions in 41 cases. Hydrocephalus, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and cerebral edema were the postoperative complications (7.15%); 1 patient died of respiratory problems not directly related to surgery. Thirty-five patients (83.3%) showed a 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale of 5. One patient, who underwent partial resection, presented a recurrence after 1 year that remained stable until last follow-up. IVMs usually reach a large size before being diagnosed. Surgical treatment is the most suitable option and total removal should represent the main goal of the procedure. The posterior parietal transulcal approach and the temporoparietal approach are the most common surgical routes used in our series.

Cool news is Trophy trucks are coming to KOH in an invitational race for big money but the bad news is (in my opinion) they moved the UTV race to the first Sunday of the week (Feb 3). This opens up a host of questions like: When can you pre-run, when is qualifying, when is tech, when will the map get released. This will make it an easier in and out for the racers who may find it hard to be gone all week but it pushes the huge UTV class farther away from the mainstream public.

MTD Timeline. Below is a timeline for the upcoming MTD changes due to take place.. (. From 1 April 2022, almost all VAT-registered businesses will have to comply, regardless of their turnover.. What does this mean?. It means that HMRC won’t accept manual entries on VAT returns any more. All info will have to be submitted using digital links.. 2024. MTD for Income Tax Self-Assessment (ITSA). Originally due to take effect in 2023, MTD for ITSA will now launch in 2024. From that date, self-assessment taxpayers will have to make quarterly submissions to HMRC. They can alter these submissions up to the time that the final figures are due.. The idea is to make tax returns more accurate. It should also make them more manageable for you and your clients by avoiding that mad rush in the run-up to 31 January. Another upside is that MTD for ITSA will help business owners predict how much tax they’ll have to pay – and plan accordingly.

Q:

How would an MMO deal with calculating and sending packets for thousands of players every tick for a live action game?

I am working on a game and I am thinking about getting into networking. I have been programming for about 5 years and got into game development the last 2 years. I only really learn online and from books on my own time. I am planning to make a java server for Amazon AWS EC2, but I am just wondering how MMO's handle multiple players each tick.
Is it just the sheer power of servers? I am not looking for code or anything, just in general how the servers work.
Does the server just do all of the calculations for all of the players and the tens or hundreds of thousands of objects and then send and receive thousands of packets every tick? It just seems like a lot for a single computer to handle, but it is indeed a server.

A:

How work and what is the job of a server?

Your server create a socket and open a port.
The protocol for an online game is generally in UDP because it is faster.
Your server have to handle ALL the clients connections.
You can add a server who is able to log an account and redirect him into a game server (this is the case for all the big MMO).
Your server have to manage all the calculations from the Data Base: when an enemy hit another enemy, subtract a part of your money when you buy some stuffs...
So the server is the main part of an online game.

In fact, a computer is really fast for do some calculations, the most heavy part for a modern video game is the physics and graphics... Fortunately, these both parts are on the client part.
But, a server have to be strong! Not like a client because he doesn't need a big GPU, but he need a big amount of RAM/CPU (depend of the game) and he also need to stay cold.
In fact, a game server is able to handle a large amounts of connections because of the UDP protocol and because all the heavy parts of the program are on the client side. You can take a look here: Creating a Multiplayer game in python and read the part when I explain the difference between the UDP and the TCP protocol.
All the others informations about how work an MMO server are linked at the end of this topic.
Now we can try to build a server!
Firstly, do you know how to create a server?

Program or download a server for do a test (example: TeamSpeak or Mumble).
Launch him from your computer and allow his input connections from your firewall.
Log you on your modem and forward/redirect the port of your server into your computer.

For the last part, you need to do some research: Which port is used by my server and how to forward a port with my modem (each modem is different).
Now you can try to log you into your server. But...!
Your computer have three IPs:

The Loopback address: localhost, 127.0.0.0 (The "0" can change)
The Intranet address (IP linked to your computer): 192.168.0.0, 172.16.0.0, 10.0.0.0
And the internet address (IP linked to your modem): 0.0.0.0

How to know your Intranet/internet IP? That depend of your Operating System and your modem. For the Intranet use your terminal and write "ifconfig" or "ipconfig". For your internet address, it is sometime write when you log you to your modem, or you have to visit a website who is able to show you your IP.
If you create a server and you didn't forward the port from your modem, you can still access to your server in local with your Loopback address and the others computers connected to the same modem can also access to the server with the Intranet address. Also, if you need to test if your server is accessible from internet, you have to test the connection with your internet IP, but some modem don't allow the externals connections from the Intranet... So if your connection with the internet IP doesn't work, try to log you to your server from another modem (friend's PC, Cyber-Coffee...).
Lastly, how to protect your server?
This is really difficult and you cannot create a perfect security... Especially if you follow my advices but you didn't complete my knowledge with your own research.

Root access

This is the most important part. When a lamer try to access to your server, he can just try a simple connection like the http/ssh/ftp. If he can access to your hard disk and you haven't chose a strong restriction, he can simply read/modify/delete the Data Base of your game. The Data Base contain all the informations about the accounts.

Firewall

We have already talk about the amount of connections/calculation than a server have to handle. In some attack, the lamer try to create a big amount of connections and didn't close them. We call that a DOS (with 1 computer) or DDOS (more than 1 computer). So you need a good firewall for: allow only the port of your server, allow only X numbers of connections from an unique IP and allow only X numbers of new connections every minutes.

Updates

This is the easiest part: keep your Operating System (and the others applications) up to date.

Less is better

Don't install many useless software to your server. If a software is not import for your server, you shouldn't install him because: firstly, that can be a virus. Secondly, a malware can exploit this software for install a virus or steal the root access.

Encryption

The encryption is really important for block an Hacker. For example, with the https protocol you can protected the user's passwords from the MITM attack. And with the Bluefish/SHA/others, you can encrypt your Data Base for protect her even if an Hacker can read it. The most important is always to block the write/modify/deletion/execute right of the Hacker (in fact, all the clients of your game need the read access).

Anti-virus?

In the case of an online-game, an anti-virus is not really important (But still recommended for all Operating System, Linux/Unix also).

Have a good server

If your server is programmed without take care of the security, you can be in trouble. Example: Buffer Overflow attack in C/C++.

Hint - If you are interesting by create an online game, you have to do many research, I cannot really answer in this question because is not the purpose of the subject. And this subject is too large for write a new answer at each question... Which software use for program a game? How to build a socket? Where started? But I have already answer at some similar questions. Even if the programming language are sometime different, I give you the link, the logic is always the same so it can maybe help you:

Hyperbaric oxygen: does it promote growth or recurrence of malignancy?
It has been a concern that a therapeutic modality recommended as an adjunct to healing and administered to promote proliferation of fibroblasts, epithelial cells and blood vessels in a wound could also lead to proliferation of malignant cells and angiogenesis in a malignant tumor. The first reported concern that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) might have cancer growth enhancing effects appeared in a paper by Johnson and Lauchlan in 1966. In a series of patients treated with HBO2 radiosensitization, they reported a more frequent than expected incidence of metastases and an unusual pattern of metastases. The published literature from clinical reports, animal studies and cell culture studies are reviewed. Putative mechanisms whereby HBO2 could have carcinogenic effects are discussed. The processes of angiogenesis in wound healing and in cancer growth are compared and contrasted. In vitro, in vivo and clinical studies strongly suggest no more than a neutral effect of HBO2 on tumor growth. In fact some studies suggest a negative impact of HBO2 on malignant progression or formation. For angiogenesis, similarities in wound healing and cancer are striking but significant differences are found including the relative importance of angiogenic factors and the process of cessation of angiogenesis. Tumors that grow in hypoxic environments are more prone to metastases and more lethal to the patient. They are also more likely to mutate toward resistant genotypes. Discussion of postulated mechanisms of carcinogenesis including free radical and immunosuppressive effects points out why they are not likely to enhance or cause cancer growth or initiation. In conclusion, the published literature on tumor angiogenesis mechanisms and other possible mechanisms of cancer causation or accelerated growth provides little basis for HBO2 to enhance malignant growth or metastases. A history of malignancy should not be considered a contraindication for HBO2 therapy.

RALEIGH. Duke Energy has filed a request with the North Carolina Utilities Commission for rate hikes that would give subsidiary Duke Energy Progress an additional $477 million a year. Duke Energy Progress has not raised rates since 2012. The utility’s request of 14% for households and 9% for businesses was approved by the utilities commission, but cut to an average of 5% by the state Supreme Court. Duke is now asking for what would amount to an average 14.9% average increase, with a typical residential rate increasing 16.7%, or $17.80 a month. Additional revenues would help pay for an $11 billion investment the company is making in converting plants to source natural gas and renewables over the next 10 years, $25 billion it is spending upgrading transmission systems to accept input from renewable generators and ward off cyberattacks, and $5.1 billion needed to remediate coal ash ponds. Duke’s other NC subsidiary, Duke Energy Carolinas, will likely request its rate increase later in the year.

Auntie's is Spokane's largest independently owned book store, and it's nice and big. It is open seven days a week, and seems to be thriving. When I was there on a Sunday afternoon, the place was hopping.. The children's section (one of my favorites in any bookstore) is large and interesting and I wanted to live there.. I also love that Auntie's--like Powell's in Portland--stocks new and used books side-by-side. Why every bookstore doesn't do this, I don't know. Well, I probably do, but I don't like it.. If you're ever in Spokane, pay a visit to Auntie's. It's a great way to kill a few hours. Or days.. - Posted using BlogPress from my iPhone

Hepatitis Australia is currently developing a campaign to reach baby boomers and other community groups who may have been missed in past hepatitis C awareness raising efforts.. Almost eight out of ten people living with hepatitis C are not current injecting drug users. Although the majority of Australians who acquire hepatitis C did so through unsafe injecting, 67 per cent (124,590) of them are no longer injecting drug users.. Close to 230,000 people were living with hepatitis C at the end of 2015. Of these, 25,000 (11%) were born overseas in regions of high prevalence and almost 16,000 (7%) contracted the virus through transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products, unsterile medical procedures, or mother-to-child transmission..

Apart from physiological changes, teenagers have to cope with psychological changes too. Not only does their world-view undergo rapid change, the world-view of family and friends changes as well. Often parents don’t realize that their teenager’s refusal to sleep at the proper hour may in fact be a serious health issue and not a rebellious act. Adolescence or teenagehood is the most crucial period of our life because it is the time where we evolve from child into adult.

During exercise, lactic acid or lactate is produced in contracting skeletal muscle. Lactic acid acid that is not otherwise used by the cell is cleared from the cell and carried into the blood stream as lactate since hydrogen ion dissociates from lactic acid. Individuals have a resting blood lactate concentration. The more a muscle cell contracts, however, the more lactic acid or lactate is produced in the muscle cell and the more lactic acid is carried into the blood stream as lactate and dissociated hydrogen ion. When the rate of production of lactic acid exceeds the rate of lactate clearance or removal and hydrogen ion buffering capacity, blood lactate concentration increases and blood pH decreases.
The blood lactate concentration for an individual at which the individual has a reduced ability to sustain exercise intensity as manifested, for example, by fatigue is known as the lactate threshold or maximal lactate steady state. A common maximal lactate steady state in an individual is about 4 mmol blood lactate. Individuals with an ability to sustain a higher percentage of their maximum capacity for exercise before reaching maximal lactate steady state tend to be better endurance athletes. That is, an individual's ability to sustain a higher percentage of their maximum capacity for exercise before reaching maximal lactate steady state can be used to predict endurance performance.
A common method for increasing an individual's lactate threshold or for improving an individual's work output at maximal lactate steady state is through exercise training. Regular exercise training increases mitochondrial biogenesis such that the content of mitochondria is increased in muscle. Without wishing to be bound by scientific theory, a higher mitochondrial mass may lead to a lower rate of lactic acid production, an increased clearance rate of lactate (via oxidation) or both for a given level of exercise intensity. As a result, lactate threshold is effectively increased or lactate response during exercise is effectively improved, that is, the individual has the ability to exercise at a higher intensity before exceeding their maximal lactate steady state, for example before a blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol is reached.
Quercetin is a flavonol found in some fruits and vegetables. A cocktail including quercetin, green tea extract, vitamin C, vitamin E, caffeine, niacin, taurine, vitamin B6, vitamin B2, vitamin B1, and glucose was studied and reported to improve cycling time trial performance under certain conditions. However, the investigators recognized that the improved performance could not be attributed to quercetin alone. See MacRae and Mefferd, International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, 2006, 16, 405-419. Quercetin has been reported to increase mouse brain and mouse muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and exercise tolerance in mice. See Davis et al., Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Inter. Comp. Physiol. 296: R1071-R1077 (2009). Quercetin has also been reported to increase maximal oxygen uptake and cycling performance in certain individuals. See Davis et al., International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, 2009, 20, 1013. The effect of quercetin and DMSO on skeletal myogenesis from C2C12 skeletal muscle cells has been reported. See Basic Appl Myol 11 (1): 31-44 (2001). However, none of the studies demonstrated a method of reducing blood lactate concentration by administration of quercetin to an individual, methods of improving muscle cell performance in an individual by reducing blood lactate concentration, or methods of increasing the lactate threshold or the maximal lactate steady state in an individual allowing extended high intensity physical activity.
It is therefore an object of the present invention to reduce blood lactate concentration in an individual by administration of quercetin. It is a further object of the present invention to extend high intensity physical activity by reducing blood lactate concentration. It is a still further object of the present invention to create an assay for identifying compounds capable of reducing lactic acid concentrations in a muscle cell. These and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention or certain embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following disclosure and description of exemplary embodiments.

Posted by Bram Reichbaum at 7:13 PM. When was this conversation?. Hey - where's the trash can story?. Sorry ... the conversation was held I think in about April of 2007.. This is precisely why Dowd will not win the primary. Excellent debater about the issues. I enjoy listening to him articulate his point of view. He can vote with the best of them, but where's his authority? Perhaps he's great behind the scenes and doesn't care about the credit, but if that's the case, then where are the endorsements?. Baby Huey will win touting his balanced budgets and his (by his accounting) initiatives which have helped our great city.. When was this conversation?. It was during an unseasonably warm Sunday afternoon during the 2007 primary season.. Also, my wife's right: I DO look slightly less idiotic with short-cropped hair.

RASONs: a novel antisense oligonucleotide therapeutic approach for asthma.
Inhalation based approaches enable the local delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASONs) to the respiratory tract and thus facilitate the ability of ASONs to target and modulate the activity of discordantly expressed respiratory disease genes. Studies involving EPI-2010, a respirable antisense oligonucleotide (RASON), targeting the adenosine A(1) receptor, a G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) that plays an important role in the aetiology of asthma, demonstrate that ASON therapeutics can be delivered directly to the lung as an aerosol. EPI-2010 has been shown to inhibit adenosine A(1) receptor expression and significantly improve allergen-induced airway obstruction and bronchial hyper-responsiveness in animal models of human asthma. Absorption, tissue distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) and safety studies of aerosolised EPI-2010 suggest that phosphorothioate RASONs can be delivered to target respiratory tissues in low, safe, efficacious and long-acting doses. This supports the concept that RASONs offer the potential to address a variety of respiratory targets including those for which approaches employing systemic distribution and systemic bioavailability of the therapeutic agent may be undesirable. In addition, our studies with EPI-2010 indicate that the RASON approach may represent a technology that is uniquely positioned to address the challenges of the post-genome era in respiratory drug discovery, since it enables simultaneous in vivo target validation and antisense therapeutic discovery in an accelerated timeframe.

I am taking my reception centerpieces pretty seriously. When I worked as a floral designer, I made so many bubble bowl arrangements that I promised myself that when my time came to get married, I'd do something with a little more originality. One idea I'm toying around with is old Limoges bowls filled with garden roses. Ebay has an awesome selection from $5 to $200 a piece. Yard sales, auctions, and antique stores also good places to browse. Here are a few I found on Ebay:. I love the different shapes and patterns! At the end of the reception, you can give the arrangements to favorite relatives, or keep the bowls for yourself and have a great collection for dinner parties. Each year, on your anniversary, set a romantic table for dinner and fill a bowl with the same flowers used on your wedding day. Any way you slice it, these bowls will be a lasting keepsake.

First to define neonatal intensive care. Now we're revolutionizing it. A lot has changed since we opened the first Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in 1960. That's why, when we set out to design a brand new NICU unlike any other, we applied the latest developments and best practices in neonatology to devise a revolutionary new model of care. Maternal/neonatal couplet rooms, an onsite procedure room, advanced technology and the future home of the latest neonatal MRI are just a few of the reasons our NICU is one of the most advanced in the country. So families will have a better experience while they're here and know they've given their baby the best possible opportunity for a happy, healthy life. ynhch.org

Just a few sample pics of the B-17G 42-32076 Shoo Shoo Shoo Baby from my personal archives documenting the B-17s I have had the good fortune to see in person. It was great to see it at the National Museum of the USAF during the 447th BG reunion in Dayton, OH.. Being held for future delivery to the Smithsonian, access to the Shoo Shoo Shoo Baby is not open to the public, and it was through a very generous arrangement that Mitchell and I were escorted onto the Wright-Patterson AFB to see it and the B-17E The Swoose. We also learned about other extraordinary and unique projects they have in the works. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity that we shall remember for a long long time!

Feathers are everywhere right now. I do think the feathers in the hair is cute but I'm probably a little too old to pull off that trend. I did see some adorable feather earrings in the store but they were so long that they reached my shoulders. I knew I would never wear them. So, I decided to make some myself.. Jo-Ann's fabric has tons of feathers available and I already had earring bales on hand. I actually just used duct tape to attach the feathers to the earrings. i wasn't sure if I was going to like them and told myself that if I did, then I would re-do them. I do like them and have worn them a few times but I know I will never get around to re-doing them. Just look at my To-Do Pinterest board and you know I'll never get around to most of the things that I want to do ;-). I love your comments, please leave one.

Massed Voices and the Charismatic Encounter

It is a feature of charismatic leaders that they are most famously depicted surrounded by crowds. Hitler addressing his rallies, Jesus feeding the five thousand: one of the ways we recognise charismatic authority is by its power to galvanise large groups.

But I have been thinking recently about how the large groups themselves may be part of the dynamic that generates the charismatic encounter. If we consider Raymond Bradley's conception of charisma as a property that emerges from a group with a particular set of beliefs and relational structures that attribute the extraordinary powers to a particular person or social position, it seems that the crowd is as important as the leader in creating the experience.

I have been thinking about this in particular in relation to the phenomenon of massed-choir events. These may be a feature of festivals, of civic events, or as one of the commercial ventures that have sprung up in recent years that offer participants local preparation over a number of weeks leading up to a concert in a major venue. If you lead a choir, you will get reasonably regular invitations to bring your singers along to participate in these.

My observation of these events is that they often feature the key elements of Bradley's category of communion: intense bonds of love/brotherhood, optimism, and euphoria. And it strikes me that the experience of communion that massed choirs offer is much the same in process and structure as that offered by a regular choir, but intensified by iteration at an extra level.

The processes involved include:

Separation from everyday life: The regular choral rehearsal is often configured as an experience bracketed off from our day-to-day activities. It has its own particular space with its own special layout; the act of warming-up is not just a matter of vocal technique, but is also a ritual by which we leave the outside world behind and step into our choral identities. But regular experience can easily habituate us, and ritual slips into routine.

The massed voice event re-invigorates this dimension by separating singers from their regular rehearsal spaces and placing them somewhere marked out as significantly more special than the social spaces choirs occupy as a matter of course: concert halls, cathedrals - large spaces that a provide cultural focal point to a significant size of regional population.

The reputational effect of a special leader: Bradley identifies the existence of shared beliefs in extraordinary powers as a primary facilitator of charismatic experiences; the followers need to be ready-primed to be inspired in order to hand over their executive control to a leader.

The role of conductor is richly imbued with mythologies of extraordinary powers, which frame the relationship between director and choir. But the more conspicuously public figures who lead the massed voice events have a significantly greater promotional infrastructure behind them to generate this halo effect. This is partly to do with the set-up of their appearance: their inspirational reputation is often a key element in the advertising used to attract singers, and the event itself will place them at the centre of attention. But it's also to do with the way the singers don't have the opportunity to develop a longer-term insight into their feet of clay as they do with the directors they work with regularly.

The merging of individual egos into the group: All choral singing involves a process of de-inviduation through coordinated activity - it is inherent in the activity itself, and we have a whole panoply of rehearsal techniques we use to promote it. (Though we tend to call it by musical terms such as blend, ensemble or section unity.)

At a massed choir event, this merging works in two layers. The individual is merged into their normal choir, and the different choirs are merged into the supra-choir. The effect of this merging is partly driven just by the larger group - the more people there are, the less any one individual counts, so this is an area in which the sheer weight of numbers has an effect. And of course aurally and vocally, the bigger the sound that surrounds you is, the more you feel buoyed up by it, carried along by the stream of sound.

But also, and perhaps counter-intuitively, the greater anonymity of massed-voice events enhances the feelings of love and brotherhood. The group is bound together emotionally not by their mutual acquaintance and shared history, but by the shared experience in the moment. The niggles of choir politics and personality clashes melt away in the new context, superseded by the imperatives of the occasion.

And those imperatives are key. Not all massed-voice events turn into charismatic encounters - they still need a cause and crisis to create the spark.

For instance, the Welsh premiere of Karl Jenkins' The Peacemakers back in July was in many ways configured as a charismatic encounter, but it didn't in fact ignite into one. You could hear it in the voices: it was a good quality collection of singers, but there wasn't that clarion ring to the sound you get when a choir is really lit up.

Now, this event had many of the elements needed: the massed voices, its placement at the heart of a festival that itself is well-structured to create communion, the use of video imagery from previous Eisteddfods at Llangollen to further build emotional bonds between participants and audience members, the reputational aura of the composer himself conducting.

It had a clear cause, too - the desire for peace has that quality of an abstract, moral good that underpins all charismatic movements. But it lacked the urgency of a crisis - both text and music focused exclusively on the desideratum of peace, without showing us why it was important to strive for it. The programme notes likewise gave a brief, sad comment that the world seemed no nearer to peace than a decade ago, but that wasn't enough in itself to act as a call to action.

(Don't get me wrong, it was a successful concert with much musical beauty. But it didn't get into that transformative state of euphoria that marks a charismatic encounter.)

Contrast this to the tales of the performance of Jenkins' The Armed Man: A Mass for Peace with its accompanying footage of the carnage of war. I've not seen this, but everyone I have talked to who has speaks of it with the kind of light in their eyes and ring the voice that betokens a peak experience. And they all identify the friction between musical beauty and harrowing imagery as key to their emotional response.

So, just collecting a big crowd about you won't guarantee a charismatic encounter. But if you have collected the elements to generate one, the more people you have there, the greater will be the intensity of the experience.

[The development of pneumothorax in an elderly woman during treatment for nontuberculous mycobacterium].
We report the case of an 82-year-old woman who developed pneumothorax during treatment for nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM). In year X, she was diagnosed with NTM at another hospital after abnormalities were pointed out on a chest X-ray. She received no treatment for NTM at that time. Antibiotic treatment was introduced at the department of respiratory medicine in our hospital in year X+15. The regimen was composed of clarithromycin (800 mg/day), ethambutol (750 mg/day) and rifampicin (600 mg/day); however, treatment with the three-drug antibiotic regimen was canceled at her request and changed to erythromycin. She was then referred to our department. However, right-side cavity wall thickening was detected on chest CT in year X+17.We resumed clarithromycin (600 mg/day), ethambutol (750 mg/day) and rifampicin (450 mg/day). On the 43rd day after treatment with three types of antibiotics, she felt dyspnea and she was admitted to the hospital and was diagnosed with right-side pneumothorax. The pneumothorax was thought to have been caused by a break in the adhesion of the cavity wall. The visceral pleura was weakened by the exacerbation of NTM and the thickness of the cavity wall was improved after the resumption of antibiotic therapy. This report is considered to be an important case in which pneumothorax developed as a complication in an elderly patient during treatment for NTM.

But for The Children's Investment Fund, a $14.5 billion hedge fund that has a stake in the LSE, that doesn't spell the end for consolidation in the exchange space.

In a letter to investors, Chis Hohn, the founder of TCI, said that "exchange consolidation is still possible with InterContinental Exchange (ICE) potentially bidding for LSE."

ICE is run by Jeff Sprecher, and has been a serial dealmaker in the past, acquiring NYSE Euronext in 2013. As part of that deal, it acquired exchange-traded derivative market LIFFE. The prospect of combining LIFFE with LCH, which is owned by the LSE, is appealing to Hohn.

He wrote:

"The strategic logic is compelling as LIFFE, the second largest ETD [exchange-traded derivatives] platform in Europe, would be united with LCH, the largest OTC [over-the-counter] platform in the world. ICE would also use its proprietary data sets to launch FTSE Russell-branded ETFs [exchange-traded funds]."

These kinds of cross-border deals involving financial market infrastructure can often be fraught, political affairs. However, there is "political logic" for the UK government to permit an ICE deal for the LSE, Hohn wrote.

"It aligns the UK financial system with that of the US, which is compelling post-Brexit and cements London’s position as the derivatives capital of the financial world," Hohn said.

"A combination would create a business services powerhouse that is levered to many secular growth trends (indexing, market data and technology) with significant cross selling opportunities (corporate solutions, IT services)," the bank said.

Ground is Broken for Blackstock Field

March 19, 1921

March 19, 1921, Greencastle, Ind. - The entire student body of DePauw gathered today with many alumni and friends of the University on the western edge of campus today as groundbreaking ceremonies were held for the new Blackstock Athletic Field. The new facility is made possible by a $25,000 gift from Mr. and Mrs. Ira B. Blackstock. Mr. Blackstock is an 1886 graduate of DePauw and serves as a member of the University's Board of Trustees.

Plans call for a sodded football field, a practice gridiron, a separate baseball diamond, a one-quarter mile track, a 220-yard straightaway and tennis courts. Eventually, the University will construct concrete bleachers at the site. The current athletic field, McKeen Field, will be used for intramural athletics, once Blackstock Field is ready for use.

Ira Blackstock earned a bachelor's degree from DePauw in 1886 and received his master's degree from the University in 1893. In 1907, he was made a Trustee of DePauw.

Tight focusing of quasi-cylindrically polarized beams.
Based on vectorial diffraction theory, tight focusing properties of quasi-cylindrical polarized beams (QCPBs) composed of equal fan-shaped sectors with linear polarization are investigated. We find that, for quasi-radially polarized illumination, a weak azimuthal component emerges and the circular symmetry of focus is traded in when the total number of sector N is small, but when N≥8 it is approaching that of a perfect radially polarized beam with a deviation smaller than 5.3% and a ratio of maximum total intensity larger than 95.5%. Meanwhile, for quasi-azimuthal polarized illumination, although weak radial and longitudinal components emerge, it is also close to that of the perfect azimuthally polarized beam when N≥8 with deviation smaller than 5.3% and a ratio larger than 95.0%. These results not only reveal a deep understanding of the focusing properties of QCPBs, but also provide an important contribution toward optimization of the monolithic methods for generating vector beams.

Disillusioned by his bitter rivalry with Thomas Edison over the invention of the incandescent lightbulb, 41-year-old Maine-born inventor Hiram Stevens Maxim sailed for England in 1881, never to return to the United States. Aware that his career in electrical engineering had ended, Maxim became consumed with creating an automatic gun, inspired by the casual remark of an American friend, who said, “Hang your chemistry and electricity! If you want to make a pile of money, invent something that will enable these Europeans to cut each other’s throats with greater facility.”

A Mandeville coffee shop and eatery housed in one of the city's oldest commercial buildings was granted authority to expand its operations by the Planning and Zoning Commission Tuesday night. The Scotts, which occupies part of the first floor of the historic St. Tammany Bank Building at 201 Carroll St., sought approval from the commission to expand the business into an existing room that adjoins the coffee bar.. Scott Williams, who co-owns the old Mandeville business with Scott Discon, said they want to enlarge the kitchen and add event space to the small shop that takes up what was once the lobby of the area's first bank.. The commission, which had previously approved a zoning permit for the coffee shop, Tuesday night voted unanimously in favor of the business's new site plan. Williams said the six-month old shop needs to expand its cramped kitchen area.. The two-story St. Tammany Bank Building, located one block from Lake Pontchartrain at the corner of Carroll and Claiborne streets, was built in 1904.

Bariatric Counseling (pre or post surgery)

Bariatricprocedures, while often medically necessary, can be emotionally and physically challenging.Supportive therapies examining one’s emotional relationship with food, coping strategies, and nutritional support are necessary to ultimately achieve one’s optimum level of health.

Your relationship with food is a focus of bariatric counseling- Understanding the “when, what and why of eating.”

Emotional support- Your changing body and relationship with food is an evolving process. It can be overwhelming, exciting, confusing- a spectrum of emotions. Understanding and normalizing these feelings is critical to healing physically and emotionally.

Hardly here 24 hours and have already reconnected with so many local friends, returning friends, and even had time to make new friends.. My long time wonderful friend Sue was visiting her daughter in Firenze, then spent a night with us before heading home. We had appertivo last night at Tuscher Cafe (Benita’s favorite!),. then lunch there again today including Pici Amatriciana and a caprese salad.. Pici is like a thick spaghetti, made from flour and water only. It originated in the Siena area and is usually only found in Tuscany. The Amatriciana included speck, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes and cheese. Delicioso! And as usual, there’s nothing quite like an Italian tomato.. In between all the eating, we managed some walking on the steep streets of this lovely Etruscan town.. And then just before heading home, we stopped in the piazza, and as usual, always something happening.. Finally, I had to stop these kids as I had never seen so large a gelato. Glad I got to them before the dripping began!. Ciao for now,. Judy

Governor Xu Visits Finland to Promote Hunan-Finland Co-op

2017-07-17

Hunan Governor Xu Dazhe visited Finland between July 13 and 15, 2017, to promote Hunan-Finland cooperation in the “Belt and Road” Initiative efforts.

Governor Xu went to the Northern Europe & Hunan Agriculture Industrial Park in Kouvola, Kymenlaakso region. He met with the Kymenlaakso Parliament President and congress member at the Hunan-Finland Exchange and Cooperation Meeting, and signed a province-region cooperation agreement. He also witnessed some Hunan and Finnish companies reaching cooperation agreements.

Xu hoped that Hunan and Finland will, under the cooperation agreement, enhance governmental communication and visits, to support non-governmental and company cooperation. Beyond that, resource, industrial, and technological advantages should be used to promote bilateral cooperation in ecological agriculture; environmental protection; sci-tech innovation; economic and trade; logistics; culture; and, tourism.

Civil rights advocates and Muslim leaders in Australia have widely denounced new legislation that calls for dual nationals who are convicted of terrorism-related offenses to be stripped of their Australian citizenship.

The legislation is designed to staunch the flow of Australians going to the Middle East to join groups such as the self-described Islamic State, and to help prevent domestic terror attacks like the hostage crisis in Sydney last December that left three people dead.

The Australian Parliament has passed a raft of anti-terrorism laws in the past 12 months that grant law enforcement agencies new sweeping powers. They can now monitor Internet traffic of suspected jihadists and prevent people from traveling to conflict zones in Syria and Iraq.

But with many Australians considering citizenship a fundamental right, the legislation introduced to Parliament on Wednesday is among the most controversial anti-terrorism measures yet. Civil rights groups have raised concerns about its scope and constitutionality, while Muslim leaders have accused the government of singling out their community.

Losing citizenship

If Parliament passes the legislation, Australia would join a small group of countries – including France, Britain, and New Zealand – that have similar laws. Yet most have rarely used the power to revoke citizenship.

“If enacted, our legislation will be as tough as exists in any equivalent Western nation in dealing with citizenship and terrorism,” says Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra.

The government estimates that just over half of the approximately 120 Australians who have traveled to Iraq and Syria to fight for IS are dual citizens.

Under the proposed laws, Australian citizenship would be automatically forfeited if a person was convicted of a terrorist act by an Australian court or found to be engaged in terrorist activity at home or abroad. The law would also apply to anyone providing or receiving training linked to terrorism, as well as recruiting or financing for jihadist groups. Any loss of citizenship would be open to judicial review.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott initially proposed granting the immigration minister the power to revoke a person’s citizenship without any chance of judicial review. He also wanted to extend the legislation to cover sole nationals. The plan led to a chorus of criticism from government officials and legal experts who warned that it would breach the constitution.

Constitutional lawyer Professor Greg Craven told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he welcomed an amendment to the legislation that prevents the immigration minister from exercising sole executive power.

“If your citizenship did lapse … and you presented yourself in Australia, you would be perfectly free to say, 'No, that's not the case, I didn't do it, I wasn't there, I wasn't a member of that body', and ultimately that would have to be determined by a court,” he said.

Mr. Abbott has said that the question of whether the law should be applied to sole nationals and operate retrospectively would be reviewed separately.

Rodger Shanahan, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney, says critics of the new legislation ignore the fact that existing laws that automatically strip citizenship from dual nationals who fight for a country at war with Australia have been on the books for almost 70 years.

“The principle of the new laws is much the same expect that they apply to non-state actors such as terrorist groups,” he says.

Muslims raise concerns

The debate has caused disquiet among Australia’s 600,000 Muslims. Ghaith Krayem, president of the Islamic Council of Victoria, said at a recent anti-racism forum in Melbourne that the legislation is clearly aimed at Muslims.

“They are going to apply to our community, our community alone,” he said.

The legislation was introduced to Parliament amid reports that two of the most notorious IS fighters from Australia, Mohamed Elomar and Khalid Sharrouf, were killed recently in an airstrike in Iraq. Mr. Sharrouf gained widespread attention last year after the publication of photographs showing him posing with his young sons holding the severed heads of executed Syrian soldiers.

Mr. Shanahan says it is unlikely that the prospect of forfeiting Australian citizenship would have deterred either man from joining IS.

“Many of the recruits joining Islamic State are young and not concerned about losing their citizenship,” he says. “If you’re a dual national and you’re considering going to join a terrorist group, that means you’ve probably got an identity issue as it is.”

Mr. Jennings agrees that those who have gone further down the path of radicalization “would not be motivated by the fear of losing citizenship.” But he says it’s important for the government to be seen as doing something to combat homegrown terrorism.

“Ever since the Bali bombings, Australians have had a sense that there is a direct connection between terrorist ideologies in Asia and [the] Middle East,” he says, referring to the 2002 terrorist attack on the Indonesian resort island that killed 202 people, nearly half of them Australians. “The government needs to be seen to be talking tough, so the emphasis is very much on the punitive aspects of the fight against terrorism.”

Ethical issues related to HIV/AIDS: case reports.
The continents of Africa and Asia have the highest number of HIV infected persons in the world. Worldwide there are 42 million and 29.7 million (70%) are in sub Saharan Africa [United Nations AIDS (UNAIDS). Available from: www.unaids.org]. The stigma and discrimination attached to HIV/AIDS are hampering control of the disease. Family life has greatly been disrupted by the pandemic. AIDS causes illness, disability and death as well as severe economic and emotional disruptions to the families. The epidemic is well established in South Africa. The mortality will be doubled over the next five years. A broad range of coercive measures has been considered to be applied internationally in the interest of controlling the spread of HIV. Responsibility of the employers to their HIV/AIDS employees at workplace, choice of termination of pregnancy when a woman is HIV positive, attitude of health care provider to their HIV infected patients, informed consent for taking blood to protect from transmission of infection in a case of accidental prick, and forced resignation from employment, are discussed in this manuscript. The ethical problems are highlighted, and possible solutions recommended.

That just means that the fuel filter has to work harder as your vehicle ages. It'll get clogged sooner and need to be replaced more often.. A symptom of a clogged fuel filter is that the engine sputters at LA highway speeds or under hard acceleration. That's because enough fuel is getting through around Slidell, but when you need more fuel for speed, enough just can't get through the filter. Obviously, that could be dangerous if your car or truck can't get enough power to get you out of harm's way on a busy Slidell freeway.. For just that reason, fuel filters have a bypass valve. When the filter is severely clogged, some fuel can bypass the filter all together. Of course that means that dirty, unfiltered fuel is getting through to be burned in the vehicle engine.. This dirt can then clog and damage your fuel injectors. Now injectors are not cheap to replace in Slidell, Advantage Tire Wheel & accessories in Slidell. But if it's neglected, it could lead to thousands of dollars of repair bills.

Trump opioid panel member says ‘We want medicine, not media’

Trump opioid panel member says ‘We want medicine, not media.’

(CNN) Former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, a member of the President’s commission on opioid addiction, has a message for the Trump administration a day before it is expected to declare a national emergency on the epidemic: “We want medicine, not media.”

When asked about first lady Melania Trump’s recent focus on the issue and the expectation she will continue to be part of the public effort, Kennedy didn’t mince words.

“We don’t want any more photo-ops,” the former Democratic congressman from Rhode Island said in a phone interview with CNN on Wednesday. “I’m just speaking as an advocate, in this fight every single day as someone who is in recovery and someone who is an advocate. We don’t want any more visits to rehab centers and photo-ops, saying how courageous we are. Enough already. We want to save lives.”

Advocates for Opioid Recovery is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing a science-based, evidence-based treatment system that can reduce death and suffering from opioid addiction, and produce more long-term opioid addiction survivors who are positively engaged in their families and communities.

According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 2 to 5 percent of all cancer patients have metastatic (secondary) tumors for which routine testing cannot locate the primary site. This is called cancer of unknown primary origin. Patients may be diagnosed with cancer of unknown primary origin if the primary tumor is too small to be identified with routine imaging tests, it regresses (disappears) before a secondary tumor arises or the secondary tumor has several possible primary sites. Cancer of unknown primary origin can appear anywhere in the body, but is most commonly found in the lymph nodes, liver, lungs, bones or skin... About miRview ® Precision Therapeutics.

1. Field of the Invention
The present invention is directed to vehicle occupant restraint systems, and specifically to a pivoting arm that operates as a seat belt upper anchor point.
2. Background of the Invention
An occupant restraint system in a vehicle such as an automobile, truck, van, helicopter, airplane or any other self-propelled vehicle is an expensive component, yet critical for safety. A popular restraint system is the three-point system including a lap belt secured at a first and second point and a torso belt secured at the second and a third point. The first point, in many designs, comprises a lap belt inertial retractor that removes slack from the lap belt and locks-up upon a sudden stop.
The second point typically is a tongue and buckle arrangement wherein the buckle is secured to the side of a seat opposite the inertial lap belt retractor and the tongue can be secured to and released from the buckle. Respective ends of the lap belt and torso belt are either secured to the tongue in a fixed tongue arrangement or, in a sliding tongue arrangement, the lap belt and torso belt comprise a continuous belt that can slide through an opening in the tongue. The third point in a three-point system typically includes an inertial retractor located in the lower portion of a B-pillar (in the case of an automobile, for example) and the torso belt passes through a D-ring typically attached to an upper part of the B-pillar. In some more recent designs, the torso belt retractor and D-ring are attached to the seat frame.
Many recent restraining system designs provide for a vertically slideable D-ring (height adjuster) to accommodate passengers of varying size in addition to the one or both inertial retractors used to supply or take-up the appropriate amount of torso belt length to accommodate a specific individual. In any event, the constant sliding motion of the torso belt through this D-ring leads to undesirable wear on the torso belt itself, thereby decreasing the torso belt's ultimate strength and presenting undesirable appearance. Furthermore, in a fixed tongue arrangement, it is expensive to have two inertial retractors. Further still, a manual or motor driven D-ring height adjuster is expensive.

Three year outcome of the residents in a special nursing home.
The 3 year outcome of 48 residents in a special nursing home was investigated, using Hasegawa's dementia rating scale (HDS) and activities of daily living (ADL). For all the residents, HDS score correlates well with age (P < 0.01) and ADP score (P < 0.001). Nineteen residents (40.4%) died during the period surveyed. Two-thirds of the residents with low ADL score died during the period, whereas 70% of the residents with high ADL score are alive. Of these scales, ADL correlated well with the fatal prognosis, suggesting that ADL is a valuable prognostic tool. As for the causes of death, pulmonary disease was prominent (n = 12, 63.2%). Consequently, the prevention of pulmonary disease is needed to achieve a good outcome in the management of nursing home residents.

Q:

How to determine the value of socket listen() backlog parameter?

How should I determine what to use for a listening socket's backlog parameter?  Is it a problem to simply specify a very large number?

A:

There's a very long answer to this in the Winsock Programmer's FAQ. It details the standard setting, and the dynamic backlog feature added in a hotfix to NT 4.0.

A:

I second using SOMAXCONN, unless you have a specific reason to use a short queue. 
Keep in mind that if there is no room in the queue for a new connection, no RST will be sent, allowing the client to automatically continue trying to connect by retransmitting SYN. 
Also, the backlog argument can have different meanings in different socket implementations. 

In most it means the size of the half-open connection queue, in some it means the size of the completed connection queue.
In many implementations, the backlog argument will multiplied to yield a different queue length.
If a value is specified that is too large, all implementations will silently truncate the value to maximum queue length anyways.

A:

From the docs:

A value for the backlog of SOMAXCONN is a special constant that instructs the underlying service provider responsible for socket s to set the length of the queue of pending connections to a maximum reasonable value.

The temples get revenue through selling of prasadams, argitaseva and others, money from hundis, lease from lands and other sources.

Hyderabad: Devotees visiting major temples have to pay more from July. Major temples, which have more than Rs 20 lakh annual revenue, are brought under Goods and Service Tax (GST) purview.

There are 149 such temples in Telangana state. Section 73 of the GST Act states renting of rooms, where charges are Rs 1,000 or more per day, renting of premises, community halls, Kalyanamandapam or open area where charges are Rs 10,000 or more per day, will attract 18 per cent tax.

But it is not clear whether GST will be collected on Argitaseva tickets or other services extended by the temples. Telangana endowment minister A. Indrakaran Reddy said that there were 149 temples that earn over Rs 20 lakh annual revenue. Out of which, 16 temples had over Rs 1 crore annual revenue while three had over Rs 25 lakh annual revenue, he said.

He said it is not clear as to which services will attract GST in these temples. Officials said raw material for the preparation of prasadams will cost more. For example, 5% GST was imposed on cashew nuts, and 12% GST on ghee.

The temples get revenue through selling of prasadams, argitaseva and others, money from hundis, lease from lands and other sources. The officials said whether the income of temple through hundis will also come under taxable revenue or not is not clear. Earlier, the state government used to give tax exemptions to temples.

But, the government has started collecting GST from temples from now now. Some famous temples that come under GST purview are Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Devasthanam, Yadagirigutta, Nalgonda district; Sri Seetha Ramachandra Swamy Devasthanam, Bhadrachalam, Khammam district; Sri Gnana Saraswathi Ammavari Devasthanam, Basara in Adilabad district; Sri Yellamma Pochamma Devasthanam, Balkampet, Hyderabad and others.

About Me

Hello, and welcome to my slice of paradise ❤

My name is Nicki – I am 33 years old, Irish & Scottish, Bacon Lover, whiskey drinker and Netflix Marathoner… and I have an incurable wanderlust. After studying criminology and law, I went on to get my MBA because I love business. I have a full-time career in Washington, D.C. and I now utilize almost every weekend, holiday and time off to travel.

From a young age I was fiercely passionate about seeing the world and meeting people from all walks of life. At the ripe age of 18 I started taking seasonal jobs around the United States and traveling to 48 of the 50 states. Fast forward to today – I have one state left to visit .. hint: It is cold and located next to Canada.

Luxury travel, food and photography is something I have focused on for the last 10-11 years of my life in my travels. I love experiencing the best hotels in the world in different destinations while eating the local flare. I like to share my experiences traveling and eating around the globe on my social media channels and here on my blog. I’m good about responding to everyone – so don’t be shy.

How did I end up in this industry? By accident if I am being honest. I was working on my MBA and started a blog just to write about my travels and put pictures somewhere so that when people asked I could just direct them there. From the time I went to Hawaii in November of 2015 – I traveled almost entirely full-time until March of 2017 circling 3 continents. Once I finished my masters degree I decided to get a career at home and keep this part-time – but this is still full-time and I love it.

One of the most asked questions I get is: What is your favorite country?

It was Turkey – and Turkey was the top for about 7 years until I met Iceland. Iceland is a different kind of magical – one that I will never be able to put into words, but it gave me the butterflies and chills in a good way. I have this deep love affair with Iceland.

Glacier LagoonNorthern Lights – Vik, Iceland

Currently I am exploring North America for most of 2017 – if you happen to see me say hi! I love meeting new people and that is one of the reason I love to travel.

Discipline: Philosophy. This paper seeks to develop a Wittgensteinian response to the Scope Problem, which ensnares a theory of truth considered as inflationary. The scope problem challenges any inflationary truth theory to provide a single explanation which can account for the concept of truth given the diversity of statements that most of us are willing to accept as true. In line with Wittgenstein’s later views on language and philosophy and their corresponding functions, this paper provides a general diagnosis of the problem: similarities in syntax do not entail similarities in meaning. By employing Wittgenstein’s metaphors (i.e., “handles” and “tools”) and an analysis via concrete cases and analogies, this paper responds to the challenge presented by the Scope Problem not by providing a satisfactory definition of truth but rather, by providing its “dissolution” à la Wittgenstein.

Clubbers Guide 2003. Amp Associates has designed the cover for the Ministry of Sound’s bi-annual compilation album Clubbers Guide 2003, which is released on 7 January 2003. According to Amp Associates creative director Scott Parker, the consultancy was briefed to combine a strong commercial identity with the ‘coolness and credibility’ associated with club culture. To achieve what Parker describes as ‘these two contradictory requirements’, the consultancy used ‘strong, energetic and fashionable’ photography. ‘Simple understated typography allows the image to do the talking,’ adds Parker. The background effects were shot at London’s futuristic Cynthia’s Robot Bar. Parker worked on the project with art director Tom Lardner.

Cleghorn Lakes Wilderness

The Cleghorn Lakes Wilderness is a  wilderness area in the southern Mojave Desert. It is located  northeast of Twentynine Palms, California, and  north of Joshua Tree National Park. It is managed by the Bureau of Land Management.

Named for the dry lakes found at the center of the wilderness area, this area has a variety of natural resources. The east portion is mountainous while the west portion is a vast alluvial fan and bajada. Elevations range from  at the desert floor to the rugged Bullion Mountains, which rise more than  across a  stretch.

Natural history
Wildlife includes Desert bighorn sheep on the slopes, and desert tortoise in the valley floor and bajada habitats.

Native plants include: Barrel cactus, and Smoke trees (Psorothamnus spinosus)" in some bajadas. The Cleghorn Lakes offer occasional spring wildflower displays. The  Crucifixion Thorn (Castela emoryi) shrub has been found near the eastern edge of the wilderness boundary. It is native to California, Arizona, and Sonora state in Mexico. It listed by the California Native Plant Society as rare in California, but is more common elsewhere in the lower Sonoran Deserts.

Imagine what it would look like if billions of microscopic crystals consisting of intricate and complex designs, each absolutely unique, fell from the sky all at once for several months at a time. It may sound grandiose, but in many parts of the world this phenomena is simply known as snow. During colder months, when temperatures are no longer warm enough for condensation to sustain itself in liquid form, wet air freezes and turns to snow. Each snowflake is like a human fingerprint, unique in its formation, size, weight and design. What snowflakes do have in common, however, is their six-sided figure, an attribute all snow crystals share. And although snowflakes are generally small in size, the world's largest snowflake was recorded back in 1887 as 15-feet across and 8-inches deep.. But if snowflakes are just made of frozen water, what makes their distinct pattern? How can we be sure no two flakes are the same?

For several years, RFA has been examining how postsecondary systems and institutions have reformed their approach to student placement in first-year classes. Until recently it was common practice to place students based on a cut score of a single exam. Yet in the last several years, the sector has moved rapidly towards collecting a much broader array of student readiness indicators to ensure more accurate placement and increase student success. RFA’s work focuses on documenting changes to state and system postsecondary placement policies; and identifying both challenges and emerging best practices.

A statue, lies, and the legacy of James Cook. There is an argument going on at the moment about replacing the statue of James Cook on Mount Titirangi at Gisborne. Barney Tupara, a representative of Ngati Oenone says that the first meeting between Maori and Pakeha was violent and nine Maoris were killed. This is a blatant example of the lies Maori activists tell now about the first encounter between Maori and Europeans, and when it is not a lie it is a distortion of the truth. The journal of Captain Cook is clear, four or five Maoris were killed, the only query being if one was killed or injured, and it was the result of Maori aggression.Read more

The two councils pay us to organise and develop five Partnership Boards in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

Each Board’s role is to support and improve care for people who use health and adult social care services.

They do this by including some of the people who use these services in their design, delivery and evaluation.

Social care includes providing social work, personal care, protection or social support services to children or adults in need or at risk, or adults in need due to illness, disability, old age or poverty.

Each Partnership Board is made up of:

Service user representatives - called Independent Members

Voluntary sector service providers

Statutory services such as health and social care

The aim is for half of the members on each board and its Chair to be health and/or adult social care service users.

Raising issues with adult social care

The Chairs attend the Adult Social Care Forum organised by Cambridgeshire County and Peterborough City Councils, chaired by the Principal Social Worker. This gives the Boards and other partner organisations a direct communication link with the adult social care senior management.

Supporting people

Healthwatch organises the Board meetings and provides support and training to the Independent Members to help them in their roles.

Carers' Partnership Board

This Board helps to improve services for carers in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

Need replacement part for "13 3 DU CMC 2"

Hello, I have a broken channel balance that has the signage "13 3 DU CMC 2" (pictured).

What is the best replacement part for this? The channel length is 14", and width is 9/16".

Both end parts have "wings"

Thanks!

Thanks for posting! Before I can offer an applicable replacement for this channel balance, I just need to know a bit more information about the bottom attachment. Please take a look at our 15-004 and 15-005 channel balance shoes, and note their depths. As you can see, they are 1-3/32" deep and 1" deep, respectively. Which one more closely matches your own bottom attachment?

A quick learner from San Jose CA says:

April 26, 2013

It looks like it's closest to 1 3/32".

U.S.
Military Participation in MLK Holiday Is an Insult to Pacifist
Leader

Ever since the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. was first celebrated
as a national holiday in 1986, the U.S. military has attempted
to co-opt the commemoration by insinuating itself into local activities
around the country, acting as if King's supporters ought to welcome
the tacit endorsement. King himself would be horrified to learn
of this turn of events.

For example, in San Diego various military contingents march
in a MLK parade, military recruiters shadow the parade soliciting
young participants and observers, and a JROTC (Junior Reserve
Officer Training Corps) color guard participates in a MLK breakfast.
Peace activists in other cities report similar instances.

Prior to his assassination, King repeatedly spoke out against
the use of violence to resolve conflicts — which is, of course,
the hallmark of the military.

In particular, King raised his voice against U.S. military conduct
in Vietnam. According to David Garrow in his book Bearing the
Cross, King resolved to help end the war after he viewed pictures
of Vietnamese children maimed by napalm dropped on civilians by
the U.S. military. In 1967 King called the U.S. government "the
greatest purveyor of violence in the world today," according
to Garrow.

King also objected to the war because African Americans and other
people of color were dying in disproportionate numbers in Vietnam.
Moreover, many black GIs were being harassed by officers and were
not receiving deserved commendations, reinforcing racial oppression
and economic injustice found elsewhere in society. This tradition
continues in today's military, where people of color are still
more likely to wind up in military prisons and much less likely
to be made officers than whites.

King criticized the racist nature of the military and thereby
linked the issues of civil rights and militarism, much to the
dismay of government officials who henceforth tried to discredit
him. But a popular movement to promote King's ideals succeeded
in overcoming the objections and a national holiday in honor of
King was established.

In a move to appropriate the MLK holiday every year, the military
participates in various events. By doing so, it hopes to obfuscate
King's moral outrage at the crimes against humanity committed
by the military.

Let's honor King by challenging the military institution that
glorifies violence and sends recruiters to MLK celebrations —
and into our high schools. Let's challenge the illegitimate authority
of the Selective Service System — and laws that deny college financial
aid to draft resisters. Let's call for a federal budget that focuses
on education, health, transportation and environmental concerns
rather than building weapons of mass destruction and military
forces that are more than willing to use them.

I have condemned any organizer of war, regardless
of his rank or nationality.
- Martin Luther King Jr., Seeds of Liberation,
1964.

In her book “The Right Stuff for Children Birth to 8” (published by the NAEYC), Martha B. Bronson talks about five different ways of playing. Kids progress through all of them depending on ages, stages, gender, cultural context, personal preference and many other factors. The types of play are: * Active Play – physical activity, sports, playing outside * Make-Believe Play – playing with dolls, different types of role-play * Manipulative Play – construction and puzzles * Creative Play – playing music, drawing and painting, crafting * Learning Play – reading books, playing games, developing certain skills (via The Playful Side of Apps | Toca Boca) Found via Geek Dad

“Plastic Galaxy: The Story of Star Wars Toys” is a documentary that celebrates the action figures, play sets, space ships, and props we grew up with as kids – and still collect today. Through interviews with collectors, historians, former Kenner and Hasbro employees, and others, the film explores their history, influence, and continued impact on pop culture.

Engineers at the University of Southampton have developed an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) whose entire structure has been printed, including wings, integral control surfaces and access hatches. Credit: University of Southampton The plane, called SULSA (Southampton University Laser Sintered Aircraft), was printed on an EOS EOSINT P730 nylon laser sintering machine, which fabricates plastic or metal objects, building up the item layer by layer. Once all the components were printed, assembly took minutes, say the engineers. No fasteners were used and all equipment was attached using ’snap fit’ techniques so that the entire aircraft can be put together without tools. The electric-powered UAV has a wingspan of about 6.5 ft, has a top speed of nearly 100 miles per hour, and runs almost silent when in cruise mode. The team even equipped it with a miniature autopilot. Traditional manufacturing methods are costlier and would have required months to develop a similar plane, whereas the design and fabrication process for SULSA took just a few weeks. Because no tooling is required for manufacture, radical changes to the shape and scale of the aircraft can be made with no extra cost. Professors Jim Scanlan from the University’s Computational Engineering and Design Research group credits laser sintering for the achievement: The flexibility of the laser sintering process allows the design team to re-visit historical techniques and ideas that would have been prohibitively expensive using conventional manufacturing. One of these ideas involves the use of a Geodetic structure. This type of structure was initially developed by Barnes Wallis and famously used on the Vickers Wellington bomber which first flew in 1936. This form of structure is very stiff and lightweight, but very complex. If it was manufactured conventionally it would require a large number of individually tailored parts that would have to be bonded or fastened at great expense.

The Bitizen Confiugrator enables you to create and customize your very own, unique Bitizen without drawing a single pixel or creating a single shade. With the help of the game’s original graphics, I re-created every single element and accessoire included in the game and put them together in one package. You can choose clothes by toggling the visibility of various categories and change their color through a simple color chooser ― all shading is applied automatically. The layer preview on the right side of the image above displays a part of the available clothing items. A few little tips before you can get started:
♦ For convenience and better visibility, I tripled the image size. If you want to have the ‘real’ size back, change the image size back to 131 x 212 by using Nearest Neighbor as interpolation setting.
♦ To export your customized bitizen without the whole background around it, simply right-click the Bitizen folder inside Photoshop’s layer window and select Convert to Smart Object. Double click the resulting smart object and save the result through Save for Web and Devices. And now, go ahead and create you own, personal Bitizen, the possibilities are nearly endless! Enjoy Please keep in mind that the original graphics are property of NimbleBit; I have simply re-created those as ‘fan artwork’ and do not claim any ownership for the idea or actual Bitizen graphics used in this template.

Day-time highs of 40°C (112°F) are not unusual in Sevilla, Cordoba and other cities in the south of Spain during July and August. But the financial crisis that has plagued the country since 2008 is making scorching days much more unbearable for many more residents. Their situation draws attention to the reality that fuel poverty is not only about being 'COLD@HOME', in regions with cold winters and for people living in cooler homes, or only about long-standing root problems such as old, poorly constructed dwellings.

In this case, relatively new factors – high unemployment, austerity measures and reforms to energy policy and energy pricing – are putting people into a home-style pressure cooker when it comes to managing budgets and trying to keep adequately cool.

Between 2006 and 2012, the rate of Spanish households who couldn't afford adequate heating in winter rose from 6% to 9%; those in arrears on utility bills rose from 4% to 6%. Over the same period, a staggering 25% of households self-reported they could no longer afford to keep comfortably cool in summer.[1], [2] These percentages translate to 7 million people who live in unhealthy conditions, in homes that are very cold in winter and/or very hot in summer.

An annual 7 200 deaths can now be attributed to energy poverty in Spain, according to the World Health Organisation. In 2010, pre-mature deaths attributed to energy poverty exceeded those from car accidents.

Yet the issue of fuel poverty was largely unrecognised in Spain until the late 2000s, when a report published by the Asociación de Ciencias Ambientales identified improving the energy efficiency of homes as a potential means of stimulating employment (Tirado Herrero et al., 2012).[3] This report stimulated further investigation of the interplay of factors driving up fuel poverty in the country, finding that the economic crisis, unemployment and rising prices all played key roles, while geography and climate led to zones where the incidence of fuel poverty was particularly high. Action to address the situation are underway, but are less effective than they could be.

I want to share a 5-minute snippet from Sam Harris in his lecture “Death in the Present Moment”. I think Sam Harris expresses this truth exceptionally well, and it is more useful to take another listen than to hear me expound on it. However, I will say I think Sam Harris is right, in that there is probably nothing more important to understand about your mind than this if you want to be happy in this world.. I will also add that the ability to drop your problem and appreciate the intrinsically good experience of life moment to moment is a skill that can be honed, like any other, and the benefits of learning and developing this skill are unique in terms of how fruitful they can be in our day to day lives.

Circulating xanthine oxidase and neutrophil activation during human liver transplantation.
Oxygen free radicals, generated by xanthine oxidase (XO) and activated leukocytes, are involved in reperfusion injury in experimental liver transplantation. The roles of XO and neutrophil activation during reperfusion in clinical liver transplantation were studied. In 10 patients undergoing liver transplantation, we assessed plasma concentrations of circulating XO by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the purine metabolites hypoxanthine, xanthine, and urate by high-performance liquid chromatography, lactoferrin by ELISA, and malondialdehyde fluorometrically up to 48 hours postoperatively. During reperfusion after portal vein declamping, elevated plasma concentrations of XO (52.1 ng/mL [range, 8.0-440.1]), hypoxanthine (81.62 micromol/L [48.2-108.7]), xanthine (21.01 micromol/L [8.7-22.3]), and lactoferrin (532.6 ng/mL [370.4-1326.6]) were observed compared with the preoperative levels (0 ng/mL [0-12], 1.88 micromol/L [0.62-3.15], 0.95 micromol/L [0-0.41], and 164.3 ng/mL [73.7-334.1], respectively; all P < 0.05). No changes occurred in urate or malondialdehyde. After portal vein declamping, XO, hypoxanthine, and xanthine levels were substantially greater in the hepatic than portal vein (all P < 0.05). Marginal transhepatic differences occurred in lactoferrin. Reperfusion during liver transplantation is associated with liberation of xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine, and xanthine from the liver into the circulation. During reperfusion, intravascular neutrophil activation takes place in the hepatic circulation.

Why can’t I file a Change of Address with USPS for my VPM account?. USPS has set regulations when it comes to forwarding your mail.. Change of Address forwarding is a convenience service offered specifically by USPS, not by us. The postal service limits the forwarding option to residential addresses and certain commercial addresses only. It does not offer forwarding from a mail-receiving agent. This is because USPS does not sort mail based on the mailbox number that we assign to you; we do so on our end to make sure that your mail lands in your account.. In the USPS address database, our Mailbox location is listed as the final destination address for your VPM mail. So any mail going to this address is simply delivered to us. We are then responsible for internally sorting mail based on mailbox numbers and inducting items into our customers' accounts. Therefore, the postal service cannot recognize and forward mail for a specific mailbox number from our location to another address.

IT HAS taken a while, but this weekend Syria joined the list of Arab countries whose citizens have taken to the streets. After Friday prayers, protests were held in Damascus, the capital, as well as Banias, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Deraa in the south. The last of these was by far the best attended, with up to 2,000 people, according to eyewitnesses.The violence has since risen. Security forces attempting to control the crowds shot and killed at least four protesters. Then on Saturday a funeral for two of them turned into another protest, which was dispersed with tear gas and fire-engine hoses. Yesterday thousands marched again, calling for an end to 48 years of emergency law, and more freedoms. One person was reportedly shot. The BBC said buildings had been torched, including the headquarters of both the ruling Baath party and the Syriatel mobile network owned by Rami Makhlouf, the business-tycoon cousin of the president, whose wealth stirs much comment and resentment. Information is hard to come by: Deraa is in semi-lockdown. Nobody is allowed in and there have been interruptions to telephone and internet services.Syria has traditionally enjoyed a two-fold stability: it is one of the most authoritarian countries in the world and many on the streets like the president, Bashar Assad. These demonstrations mark the biggest unrest in the country since he inherited power from his father in 2000.Small protests started on Tuesday when a group gathered in the Hamidiyeh market in Damascus. On Wednesday, a silent sit-in by known activists demanding the release of political prisoners was violently dispersed. Since then the focus of the protests has changed, with momentum now coming from outside the capital and from the general public.Why Deraa? It is a sleepy city of around 300,000 some 100km (62 miles) south of Damascus in a tribal Sunni area of olive groves and farmland. The spark appears to have been the arrest of more than a dozen teenagers last week for painting anti-regime graffiti on a wall. Two women were subsequently arrested. With poverty levels also rising as water levels have dropped, local anger appears to have reached a tipping point.The government, previously adept at public relations, has floundered in its response. It has used force against its citizens and simultaneously accused infiltrators of dressing up as high-ranking officials and ordering forces to shoot. But it has also made concessions, reducing the duration of the loathed military service, releasing the teenagers and announcing an investigation. Faisal Kolthoum, Deraa's governor, has been removed from his post.There are signs the crisis in Deraa could be solved. A group of prominent locals has presented a list of demands to the government. These include the end to emergency law and the dismantling of the local security office, but not the removal of Mr Assad. Friday's protesters had different motives in different parts of the country. In other areas, such as quiet Damascus, many disbelieve the news leaking out or prefer to turn a blind eye. Some activists want to pull back, viewing the situation as a dangerously unarticulated barrage of anger. Dormant opposition figures are complicating matters by trying to enter the fray.But many of those who took to the streets were calling for revolution as well as protesting against corruption and abuses of power. As on Friday, small protests were reported elsewhere in the country again yesterday. Although there is no single organiser the Syria Revolution Facebook group had called for a “day of dignity” on Friday, but its influence has been limited until now. Activists have started to create information networks. More importantly perhaps, the fear that previously prevented political action has started to dissipate.Many want change in an orderly fashion. But a continued bungled, violent response by the government could change that. Syria's economic and political woes are similar to those lamented by protesters around the region: corruption, an exaggerated security presence, soaring prices and a lack of prospects for the country's burgeoning, and increasingly globally connected, youth.

The Market Potential For Privately Financed Long Term Care Products In The UK. Download Now Free registration required. Executive Summary. This paper considers the market potential for privately financed long term care products in the UK. It finds that since the present market is undeveloped there is scope to increase the range of products available to suit people with different means and circumstances. Currently the UK spends about ?19 billion on Long Term Care (LTC) of which around a third is privately funded and two thirds publicly funded. The paper finds that very few people can afford to pay for LTC out of their own pockets from income alone, but that this number is increased if savings are taken into account and significantly increased if housing wealth is included as well.. - Format: PDF. - Size: 712.9 KB

That was a beautiful Hawaiian blessings for actors, cast, crew and location principals. There was a sunrising ceremony, prayers for all welcoming in the new day and production bringing the ancestors of all present to guide everyone during this filming. Everyone took part in the prayers and in the end everyone went into the ocean for a ‘cleansing.’ They partook in the consumption of ceremony foods as they emerged from the ocean, warmed themselves and mingled with all present. Production caterer was there to provide everyone with a healthy breakfast before heading back ‘home’, hotels or wherever they’re staying for this production. Mahalo to Hi’ilawe Productions for allowing a blessing for a filming in Hawaii like none other. There were no ‘precedents’ comparable to this ever in all the filmmaking in Hawaii. Mahalo Cameron Crowe and all who made this possible. This is how EVERY film should begin so as to level the ‘playing field’ with ALL so to continue a harmonious relationship in a special place like Hawaii.

Ross.. Synopsis via BBC. Poldark gets better with every episode, episode 7 was just brilliant. The scenes cutting together towards the end showing the consequences of Demelza's actions was an inspired piece of theatre and the performance of the actors is of a consistently excellent standard. Here in Cornwall so many people are really enjoying this adaptation of what is a very special series of novels. Well done BBC.

Anita Wilkie. Hi Shiners!. I am so honoured to have been selected to review ShineOn items, for you! I am a 34-year-old Mum of two and an ex-Aucklander, who now lives in the Wairarapa. I am a full time Mum but also run my own small social media business, from home. I’ve been purchasing almost exclusively (my friends can attest!) from ShineOn for about five years and over that time have realised that my “style” would be street/casual for the most part - but I do love to change things up with some bright colours/prints now and then. My most coveted brands would be Home-Lee and Silent Theory but I love trying new things and matching them back with my relaxed style. I am quite self-conscious of my ‘mum-tum’ and really hunt out clothing that is going to flatter/hide it, whilst still looking on trend and being comfortable! I’m really excited to show you more of the beautiful pieces that the ShineOn buying team has chosen for you all!. You can find my posts by searching on VIP Group for Anita Wilkie

Q:

mysql primary key question

How optimal is it to have a primary key on 3 or 4 fields? If the table has say millions of records, is it going to be heavy on the server running a query such as:
Select * from my_table where field1='123' and field_2='123' and field_3='hours'

The primary key is created on these fields:
field_1 int(11)
field_2 int(11)
field_3 varchar(20)
What I'm considering doing as an alternative is have those fields store the data with a primary key on a separate field which has an md5 hash of the data such as "md5(field_1+'-'+field_2+'-'+field_3) and then my script just queries one field such as:
Select * from my_table where field_hash=MD5('123-123-hours')

So basically I'm just wondering if method 1 is just as optimal as method 2 with a table with millions of records.

A:

You can read about the composite key performance from the answers to question Composite Primary Key performance drawback in MySQL
Before doing this kind of optimization, you should always measure the effects. That is, create two tables with the same data, one using composite key and the other the hash, and try which one works better in you use case. 
In general, I don't like using nonsensical key values if not absolutely necessary. If the hash is used as the primary key it means that the user of the database must be aware of the ID generation process. This leads to more documentation, that will not be read, and errors in the long run. 
Instead of using the  composite key you might want to see, if there is a possibility of normalizing your database further. Does the composite key represent a different entity and should it actually form an second table where you can attach a surrogate key to the set of columns? 
Another option is to use a surrogate key in the current table and then place a unique constraint to the current composite key e.g.

- Congo, Democratic Republic. - Conflicts and Disasters.  them happy. Business is not good these days. Because of the war it’s dangerous to farm.”. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is extremely lush and fertile, but the conflict and obstructions like checkpoints, where farmers are forced to pay bribes to get to markets, mean farmers like Mumburi can’t produce as much food as they could. The brutal conflict, along with decades of government failures and foreign interventions have taken their toll. Since 1998 an estimated 5.4 million people have died because of the violence, endemic poverty and preventable diseases.. Take Action!. Sadly, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is not the only country where conflict has taken a horrendous toll. The ongoing violence in Yemen is making an already dire humanitarian situation worse. We must push for a permanent and immediate ceasefire.. Photo: Eleanor Farmer/Oxfam. -. {headline}

A San Diego County woman in her 50s is the first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 in the region, the Health and Human Services Agency announced today.

The woman developed symptoms after traveling overseas. The woman was hospitalized and remains at a local hospital in isolation with serious symptoms.

Her test results came back positive late this afternoon at the County Public Health Laboratory, which is sending specimens to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for final confirmation.

HHSA is aggressively working to find out where she had been prior to being hospitalized and how many people had close contact with her. The appropriate people will be placed under self-quarantine and monitored for possible symptoms of COVID-19.

“We knew we would see cases in San Diego County and were prepared for them,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The public should be assured that we are following CDC guidance and continue taking appropriate steps to keep the novel coronavirus from spreading.”

Symptoms of COVID-19

Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection have reported symptoms ranging from mild to severe respiratory illness. Symptoms generally include:

fever

cough

shortness of breath/difficulty breathing

At this time, the CDC believes that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days, or as long as 14 days, after exposure.

Through March 9, HHSA had placed 76 patients under investigation. Fifty-six have tested negative and 19 are pending. A total 464 people have been placed under self-quarantine at home, 376 have finished their quarantine and 82 are currently being monitored. Six people ended up developing symptoms and became patients under investigation.

“We are monitoring these people daily and taking appropriate actions when they develop symptoms,” Wooten said. “It’s important to remember that if you did not have close contact

to the patient with COVID-19 or someone who’s traveled to an impacted country or region, the risk of infection is still low.”

What Residents Can Do to Prepare for COVID-19

It’s important for the public to be prepared should a COVID-19 outbreak occur in San Diego County. To limit the spread of infection, you should:

Wash your hands often to help protect you from germs.

Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available. It should contain at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

If you are sick, stay home and keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.

Practice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.

Residents should also follow these important tips to help prepare to respond to this public health threat.

Store a two-week supply of food, beverages and water, including food for family pets. Ensure an adequate supply of prescribed and routine medications are on hand.

Plan ways to care for those who are at greater risk for serious complications and who will take care of sick family members.

If you have family members with increased risk of getting seriously sick, check with your medical providers about symptoms and treatment.

Create an emergency contact list of family and friends, teachers and employers.

Have a plan in case your school, child care, or employer closes temporarily.

Talk with your children, family, and friends about what to do if an outbreak occurs and what each person would need.

Planning now helps you act more effectively to protect you and your family if COVID-19 does spread locally.

If you have individual questions, please talk to your health care provider. For community resources, please call 2-1-1 San Diego or visit 211sandiego.org. or coronavirus-sd.com.

At the end of 2018, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez declared that self-care wouldn’t just be a priority, but a nonnegotiable as she braced herself to become the youngest woman ever elected to the U.S. Congress. And just weeks into her term, the 29-year-old trailblazer is underlining that skin care is an integral part of her approach to the high-stakes pressures of being in office.

Last night, when Ocasio-Cortez opened up her Instagram to questions, a follower—one also well-versed in the exhaustive demands of political campaigns—asked how she stays both stress- and breakout-free. After clarifying that she, despite her optimistic disposition, is as stress-stricken as anyone who’s just run a congressional campaign, Ocasio-Cortez revealed that she’s able to maintain a healthy glow by doing her due diligence when she shops for new products.

“Skin care is straight-up a hobby of mine,” she explained on her Instagram Stories. “I’m a science nerd and I truly enjoy the science of it, reading about compounds and studies. It’s like that.” Another major influence for Ocasio-Cortez has been her mother, who she says used to break out a lot in her twenties and has imparted wisdom accordingly. “She taught me since I was a kid not to touch my face,” she explained.

Making a point to highlight that everyone’s skin is different and ever-evolving, she divulged that she considers her personal approach a blend between K-beauty and scientific consensus, and that she likes to experiment with specialized tools and treatments, such as face masks and under-eye patches. Ocasio-Cortez’s most enthusiastic recommendation? Cleansing your skin at the end of the day—even if you have to hack it. “If you’re layering your face in makeup day after day (which is totally fine!) make sure you clean or wipe your skin early when you get home so it has time to rest,” she explains, adding that she always keeps wipes next to her bed just in case. But so long as she has the energy, Ocasio-Cortez partakes in a multistep skin-care regimen. “I do indulge [in skin care] a little since I don’t buy a lot of makeup beyond my staples,” she says.

Breaking down her daily routine into three steps, she begins by double cleansing with a balm or oil to melt off makeup, before using a a more traditional face wash to lift all other impurities. Next up are the more potent elixirs, like a gentle, nourishing toner to balance her skin’s pH before she layers on supercharged serums with active ingredients such as brightening vitamin C and anti-aging retinol. Finally, she finishes things off with a moisturizer carefully tailored to her skin and, the most important step of all, sunscreen. “I’ve been using daily sunscreen since I was 19,” she explains. “I’ve been bad about it lately and can tell the difference.”

The country-less virtual currency bitcoin has soared in value in recent weeks. But lost in all the talk of a bitcoin bubble is whether the digital denomination is useful for more than just a novelty investment. What can you actually use it for? To prove the new currency has practical value a group of online retailers and bitcoin are offering Black Friday deals.

Getty Images

The group created an online deal site, BitcoinBlackFriday, to help consumers spend their bitcoin. The site first went live last year with just 74 merchants, but this year the site already has over 200 participating retailers, and is targeting a total 500 this year. “Most merchants sign up the day before Black Friday and on Black Friday itself,” says John Holmquist, founder of Bitcoin Black Friday. The site will offer discounts on everything from dating site OkCupid and CheapAir.com to handmade American rugs and Christmas trees. One retailer – the family-run Bees Brothers – is luring customers with a 20% discount on honey.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency that doesn’t require a bank or Treasury Department. Its value has risen to around $808 from below $50 in March and $10.50 two years ago. MtGox.com (short for Magic the Gathering Online Exchange), the main exchange for users swapping Bitcoins, handles around 80% of all Bitcoin trade and charges 0.25% to 0.60% for its brokerage services, depending on the size of the trade. There are around 12 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to BitcoinCharts.com.

Last week, bitcoin investors were encouraged by comments from some senior U.S. law-enforcement and regulatory officials who said they saw benefits in digital currency. In testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Mythili Raman, acting assistant attorney general for the department’s criminal division, said: “The Department of Justice recognizes that many virtual currency systems offer legitimate financial services and have the potential to promote more efficient global commerce.”

Even so, experts say the biggest risk for bitcoin remains political. “There’s a chance that Congress could pass legislation that makes it much less useful,” says Holmes Wilson, co-founder of Internet activist group Fight for the Future and participant in Bitcoin Black Friday. “The response to that challenge is to make bitcoin as popular as we can as fast as we can.” (Consumers can buy bitcoin from CoinBase.com in the U.S. Before CoinBase, Holmquist says it was “technical nightmare” to buy bitcoin.)

There is already a brisk — if narrow — trade in bitcoin. Justin O’Connell, CEO of GoldSilverBitcoin.com, says he conducts approximately $15,000 in bitcoin trades a day. “A lot of people who got into the bitcoin market earlier are switching them into silver and gold,” he says. “They are taking advantage of the high bitcoin prices and low silver and gold prices.” The recent slump in the silver and gold prices has created opportunities for bitcoinites. “We accept bitcoins for metals and metals for bitcoins,” he says.

Bitcoin: Is the Currency Becoming More Real?

Some venues are also offering Bitcoin Black Friday deals. EVR bar and lounge in New York recently started accepting bitcoin for drinks and food. On Black Friday, it will offer a “buy one drink and get one free” deal and half-price bottles of beer at EVR if they pay with bitcoin, says Charlie Shrem, a partner at the venue. Shrem is also CEO of BitInstant, a company that facilitates the retail purchase of Bitcoins at over 700,000 locations throughout the U.S. and co-chairman of The Bitcoin Foundation, which aims to standardize, protect and promote Bitcoin. “It’s a nonpolitical online money backed exclusively by code and it’s only as good as its cryptography and math.”

E-commerce sites were among the first to accept the currency. The publishing software company WordPress accepts bitcoin for features that are dependent on credit-card and PayPal payment systems; PayPal, it says, blocks access to certain countries. The social network Reddit accepts them for its premium service, as do Web-hosting company BTCWebHost.com, SurvivalCampingStore.com and online gaming site Minethings.com. Consumers can spend a fraction of a bitcoin too: It’s divisible to the eighth decimal place. It’s also possible to purchase clothing, cigars, and various goods and services with bitcoin. See a complete list of merchants.

Bitcoins could flourish in underground economies, among individuals hoping to avoid taxes or buy illegal drugs, says Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, D.C. “The more likely adoption path is not through the wealthy West but through economies where banking systems are weak, seizure of wealth is common and political systems are more unstable,” he says. Because people can use just a fraction of a Bitcoin for payment, however, he says they are also ideal for micropayments. “Want to listen to a song online?” he says. “Pay 3 cents to do it.”

Founded in 2009 by a developer (or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto, it’s still early days for the virtual currency. “It’s a very, very high level experiment,” says Ari Zoldan, CEO of technology and media company Quantum Networks in New York. For people purchasing goods and services online, however, he says it could potentially change the entire currency landscape and “be to regular currency what Skype was to the telephone industry.” Instead of trusting central banks or governments to safe keep your money, he says, “it shifts that responsibility to individuals.” Built-in limitations to the bitcoin protocol states that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin by 2140. “The bitcoin protocol is like a card game,” Holmquist says, “but you don’t have access to every single card in the deck.”

Given the currency’s meteoric rise, some critics have expressed concerns about a bitcoin bubble. And, despite the rhetoric at the congressional hearing on virtual currencies last week, the government has thus far given them as much recognition as it does to Monopoly money: Not much. And most brick-and-mortar companies on Main Street still prefer plastic or dollars. Despite his own foray into bitcoin, Shrem doesn’t expect other businesses to follow his lead — yet. “Brick and mortar companies are going to be the last one to accept bitcoin,” he says, “especially the mom and pop stores.”

NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - Stocks futures took a tumble following worse than expected August jobs data. September S&P futures were down 5.10 at 1,023.10 and Nasdaq 100 futures were 7.00 lower at 1,368.00, vs. pre-data declines of about 2.70 and 1.10, respectively. The weak data also lit a fire under bonds, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TNX, -0.09% falling 0.09 percentage points to 4.423 percent. Non-farm payrolls declined 93,000, vs. consensus economist expectations for an increase of about 19,000.

Description

Hand splitter Wedges and shims / Plugs and feathers are tools designed to split rock when driven into a drilled hole or natural crack. The wedge fits in the hole between two feathers whose flat sides form a guide that prevents the wedge from jamming as it is driven into the hole.

Use wedge and feathers as follows:

Position the feathers in the hole so the flat sides of the wedge will be parallel to the line along which the break will occur.

Drive the wedge into the slot between the feathers until the rock cracks, or until it sticks in the rock.

Then tap the wedge lightly back and forth along the inside edges of the feathers until it is freed.

Remove the wedge and, if necessary, begin again.

Proceed slowly to allow the tools time to do their work.

To be effective, wedges and feathers must be correctly sized. The diameter of the wedge rod and feathers at the point where the rod meets the feathers must exceed the diameter of the hole. Driving the wedge between the feathers forces them against the sides of the hole and splits the rock.

Avoid unnecessary stresses on wedges and feathers by drilling holes as straight as possible. Straight holes help keep wedges and feathers from binding or jamming in the hole.

Q:

Reading a list of integer in a single input line in C++

I'm trying to read multiple integers from a single input line into an array
eg. Input: 100 200 300 400, so the array is: a[0] = 100, a[1] = 200, a[2] = 300, a[3] = 400
The thing is, the number of integers are unknown, so the size of the array is unknown.

A:

You should use a container that automatically resizes itself, such as std::vector.
For example, something like this:
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <utility>
#include <iterator>

std::string line;
getline(instream, line);
std::istringstream this_line(line);
std::istream_iterator<int> begin(this_line), end;
std::vector<int> values(begin, end);

A:

You could use std::vector for this:
std::vector<int> myVector;

std::string line;
std::getline(std::cin, line);
std::istringstream os(line);

int i;
while(os >> i)
    myVector.push_back(i);

This code requires following includes: <iostream>, <string>, <sstream> and <vector>.

Cicerone Theodorescu

Cicerone Theodorescu (February 9, 1908 – February 18, 1974) was a Romanian poet.

Born in Bucharest, his father was a laborer for Căile Ferate Române state railway. After attending high school in his native city, he studied at the literature and philosophy department of the University of Bucharest. He then taught in various high schools and worked as an editor and reporter. A contributor to the left-wing press, he signed, together with other pro-democracy intellectuals, protests against the country's drift toward fascism. After the King Michael Coup of 1944, Theodorescu held important posts at Centrala Cărții publishing overseer, was vice president of the Romanian Writers' Society from 1944 and editor-in-chief of Viața Românească magazine from 1948.

Theodorescu made his literary debut in 1925 in Perpessicius' Universul literar; he subsequently published in Azi, Credința, Cuvântul, Cuvântul liber, Facla, Lumea, Sinteza, Gazeta literară, Viața Românească, Vremea, Zodiac, România Literară and Luceafărul. His first book was the 1936 Cleștar, described by Ovid S. Crohmălniceanu as "enclosing the soul's turmoil in glacial, pellucid verses, slowly carved with a jeweler's care". He drew particular notice for his verses inspired from the work and suffering of railwaymen. His other volumes followed the same direction (including Cântece de galeră, 1946; Focul din amnar, 1946; Un cântec din ulița noastră, 1953, State Prize). However, with time, his lyricism tended toward the epic or became anemic, and remained lively only in the collections of fixed-form poems such as rondels. His later books included Poteca lunii, 1964; Hronic, 1965; Zburătorul din larg, 1965; Țărmul singuratic, 1968; Platoșa duratei, 1973 and Nebunul regelui, 1976. In 1971-1972, near the end of his life, he spent lengthy periods in Rome, writing a poem about Trajan that remains unpublished.

Theodorescu translated widely, in particular Soviet literature (Vladimir Mayakovsky, Aleksandr Tvardovsky), but also authors who included William Blake, Jérôme Carcopino and Lino Curci. He collected folklore (Izvoare fermecate, 1958) and wrote prolifically for children, although some of these works are now irrecoverable. He sometimes used the pen names Radu Lăncieru, Victor Sângeru, C. Tudor and C. Tudoran.

DELIVERY LEAD TIMES FOR NEW METAL BUILDINGS. When making a new purchase of a metal building, delivery and installation – when you finally get to see your metal structure on your property – it’s an exciting time! We know and understand that, which is why we’re continually working to decrease our lead times. We design, craft, and schedule the installation team for each order, so there are times when customers may experience longer than normal lead times, though we do strive to reduce these time frames.. On average, customers can expect lead times of 2 – 4 weeks, which allows us the time we need to create each metal building to the exact specifications our customer’s request. Our sales representatives work closely with each customer to clearly communicate which stage of the construction process we’re in, and when they can expect their delivery.. The current lead time is 2 – 4 weeks.

Q:

problem involving continuity and sequences.

Please, help me to solve this problem.
$f\colon[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb R$ continuous and $ \forall n, \exists x_n \in [a,b]$, such that
 $|f(x_n) - x_n|< \frac{1}{n}$. Prove that $ \exists x \in [a,b]$ such that $f(x)=x$.

A:

The obvious thing to do is consider the sequence $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$. Since this sequence is bounded, it has a subsequence that converges to some $x_\infty$. Since $[a,b]$ is closed, this limit $x_\infty$ is also in $[a,b]$. Assume $f(x_\infty)\ne x_\infty$. Then find a term $x_n$ of the subsequence converging to $x_\infty$ with $\frac1n<\frac12|f(x_\infty)-x_\infty|$ and $|x_n-x_\infty|<\frac12|f(x_\infty)-x_\infty|$ to arrive at a contradiction.

The fact that so many computers remained vulnerable two months after the release of a patch illustrates this aspect. As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, there is simply no way for customers to protect themselves against threats unless they update their systems. Otherwise they’re literally fighting the problems of the present with tools from the past.

It applies in the field of antenna processing, where the signals originating from one or more emitters (sources) are received on a system of several sensors. The sources are received at different angles of incidence.
In an electromagnetic context, the sensors are antennas and the sources emit a polarized radioelectric signal. In an acoustic context the sensors are microphones and the sources are sound sources.
The sensors of the array receive the sources with a phase and an amplitude dependent on their angle of incidence as well as on the position of the antennas in terms of narrowband, plane wavefront and with no perturbations on the reception channels and the sensors of the array.
The antenna processing techniques currently known have the principal objective of utilizing spatial diversity. More particularly, the direction finding or locating of sources has the objective of estimating the angles of incidence of the emitters on the basis of an array of sensors.
In a nominal fashion, the direction finding procedures like MUSIC [1] assume that the wavefront is plane, that the sources are narrowband, point sources, with no polarization diversity, no coherent path and no disturbance of the response of the sensor array to a source. When one of these suppositions does not hold, the response of the array of sensors to a source no longer depends solely on the incidence but on other parameters such as the bandwidth, the coupling coefficients, the width of the diffusion cone or else the source-sensor distance.
The prior art describes various techniques making it possible to compensate for some of these disturbances. The estimation of the secondary parameters (parameters other than the incidence) is not envisaged in most techniques with the exception of reference [2] for polarization diversity. Techniques thus exist which adapt direction finding algorithms to diffuse sources [3][4][5]. For the wideband context, there exist focusing techniques [6][7] or spatio-frequency techniques [8][9][10][11]. For the techniques for compensating for the distortions of the response of the array the literature is very rich [12][13] etc.
In the prior art the techniques for compensating for the distortions of the response of the array of sensors process each of the disturbances in an isolated fashion without however taking account of several disturbances at one and the same time. Such techniques therefore turn out to be inadequate, in particular, in numerous acoustic applications where the wave is at one and the same time wideband and received as a curved wavefront. For radioelectric sources, it is possible to have an antenna array disturbed by coupling with polarization diversity waves and coherent paths.

Vast View, Fine Attention. In this session, Martin explores the apparent paradox of a vast view combined with a fine attention, along with practices to bring both into focus. How do we hold both simultaneously? How can we be responsive, without feeling responsible? How might we bring both a vast view and a fine attention to both our inner practices, and to our outer engagement, whether in our personal lives or in response to the ecological, political and social crises in which we currently find ourselves?

Multiagent learning can be seen as applying ML techniques to the core issues of multiagent systems, like communication, coordination, and competition. In this paper, we address the issue of learning from communication among agents circumscribed to a scenario with two agents that (1) work in the same domain using a shared ontology, (2) are capable of learning from examples, and (3) communicate using an argumentative framework. We will present a two fold approach consisting of (1) an argumentation framework for learning agents, and (2) an individual policy for agents to generate arguments and counterarguments (including counterexamples). We focus on argumentation between two agents, presenting (1) an interaction protocol (AMAL2) that allows agents to learn from counterexamples and (2) a preference relation to determine the joint outcome when individual predictions are in contradiction. We present several experiment to asses how joint predictions based on argumentation improve over individual agent’s prediction.

Abstract

We propose a face alignment framework that relies on the texture model generated by the responses of discriminatively trained part-based filters. Unlike standard texture models built from pixel intensities or responses generated by generic filters (e.g. Gabor), our framework has two important advantages. Firstly, by virtue of discriminative training, invariance to external variations (like identity, pose, illumination and expression) is achieved. Secondly, we show that the responses generated by discriminatively trained filters (or patch-experts) are sparse and can be modeled using a very small number of parameters. As a result, the optimization methods based on the proposed texture model can better cope with unseen variations. We illustrate this point by formulating both part-based and holistic approaches for generic face alignment and show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art on multiple ”wild” databases. The code and dataset annotations are available for research purposes from http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources.

Cambridgeshire: First Areas Get Superfast Broadband

25 November 2013, 06:00

Superfast broadband has arrived in rural Cambridgeshire under the Connecting Cambridgeshire programme, with the first areas going live from this morning.

An early Christmas present for communities around the county, the switch-on heralds the start of the Connecting Cambridgeshire high speed fibre broadband roll-out across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

Connecting Cambridgeshire is celebrating the first of many new fibre broadband cabinets to go live by unveiling a new green cabinet in the rural village of Grafham, near Huntingdon.

The roadside cabinet is one of ten new cabinets around the county being connected to the fibre network, bringing opportunities for thousands of homes and businesses to benefit from high speed Internet access.

New cabinets will also be going live from today in parts of Buckden, Cambridge (Coleridge and Queen Edith's), Offord D'Arcy, St Ives, Somersham and Whittlesey - extending the existing fibre coverage delivered under BT's commercial plans - with many more to follow over the next two years.

More than 1,500 homes and businesses linked to these cabinets will be able to receive faster broadband speeds of 24Mbps and higher before Christmas by upgrading to superfast broadband with their chosen service provider.

Leader of Cambridgeshire County Council, Councillor Martin Curtis, will cut the ribbon on the new Grafham cabinet on behalf of the Connecting Cambridgeshire programme alongside Huntingdonshire MP Jonathan Djanogly and Bill Murphy, Managing Director of Next Generation Access for BT, one of the major partners in the programme.

The high speed connection will be welcomed by many Grafham residents, including home-based businesses, who have strongly supported the county-wide campaign for better broadband encouraged by local Broadband Champions Chris Bulow and Alastair Brydon.

Leader of Cambridgeshire County Council, Councillor Martin Curtis said: "Our Connecting Cambridgeshire superfast broadband programme has had fantastic support from all over Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. We know many people have been eagerly anticipating the first phase of the roll-out since the signing of the contract with BT in March. I am delighted that we have achieved our promise to see our investment start delivering fibre broadband for homes and businesses before the end of this year.

"We are on track for fibre based broadband to be available to 98% of premises by the end of December 2015, which will make Cambridgeshire one of the best connected counties in the country. Faster connectivity will transform the way people can work and do business, as well as improving access to vital services, which will boost rural communities like Grafham."

Huntingdonshire MP Jonathan Djanogly said: "This project will be hugely welcomed by my constituents who live and work in the connected villages. Fibre broadband in rural areas is all about enabling people to operate more efficiently. As such, I see this initiative as a vital and welcome development towards sustaining rural communities."

Bill Murphy, Managing Director of Next Generation Access for BT, said: "It is a fantastic achievement that people in Cambridgeshire are already seeing the benefits of this programme. This investment in fibre broadband will boost the local economy and help to create or protect local jobs both in communities like Grafham and across the whole of Cambridgeshire. It will be of enormous benefit to local businesses which can use the faster speeds to improve their competitiveness both within the UK and abroad."

Communications Minister Ed Vaizey said: "People in Cambridgeshire are now seeing real results from our broadband programme. For the first time homes and business in Grafham have access to superfast broadband and the many benefits it can bring for work, entertainment and doing business. Investing in superfast broadband will deliver real economic benefits. An expert report* revealed that for every £1 we are investing in broadband, the UK economy will benefit by £20."

I've seen this popping up on quite a few blogs. I thought I'd repost it because before I left Australia my mum made me make a pile of stuff to take if the house was going to burn down/they got evacuated. I live on a river in Sydney near a lot of bushland and bush fires have always been a threat. She also made me do this the year before when I went to London over the Australian summer time. Back to this. It's a sweet/sort of sad project and gives real insight into what people treasure vs what they think they'll need. I know my collection included photographs, my hard-drive, artworks, my favourite cd, my favourite shoes, special things that would only mean something to me and lots of other objects... knowing that hopefully my parents would also pick up my dogs too. I thought it would be mean to lock them in a box for a year just in case the house might burn down!. Via The Burning House

Chile-Hong Kong FTA Enters into Force. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA), signed by Chile and Hong Kong, China in 2012, will enter into force on 9 October 2014. The agreement governs a wide range of issues including trade in goods and services, investment, government procurement, competition, and other related areas. With respect to investments, the FTA provides for national treatment in specified non-services sectors, alongside the provisions in the trade in services chapter that apply to investments in service sectors. The parties to the agreement have agreed to negotiate a separate and comprehensive agreement on investment promotion and protection upon the FTA’s entry into force.

In a move that could compromise ethereum’s long-held dominance as the world’s top platform for smart-contract development, blockchain interoperability project Cosmos will offer users the choice to code in at least three different programming languages.

The first language to be supported on Cosmos is called Ethermint, a direct replica of ethereum’s smart contract language Solidity. Aimed at making it easier for ethereum developers to port their applications to the Cosmos network, the Ethermint project has been in the works since as early as 2016, said Zaki Manian of Tendermint, the company that built Cosmos.

The second coding language, called Secure EcmaScript (SES), is a version of JavaScript built for secure smart contract deployment by blockchain startup Agoric. Once the native Cosmos Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is fleshed out, the Agoric blockchain and its SES programming language will be easily accessible to Cosmos users, said Agoric CEO Dean Tribble.

Last but not least, JP Morgan blockchain spin-off Kadena announced Tuesday it too would be building a version of its native smart-contract language, Pact, for the Cosmos ecosystem. Its entrant to the Cosmos coding arms race is called Kadenamint.

“We’re committing to getting an industry-level smart contract language on [Cosmos] to give developers more deployment choices,” Kadena founder Stuart Popejoy told CoinDesk.

According to Popejoy, the comparative strengths of Kadenamint outperform that of Ethermint in every way.

“We see Pact as the standard for smart contract languages because Pact is just better than Solidity,” Popejoy said, adding:

“Every single developer that comes to use it gets things done faster. It’s safer. We have formal verification baked into the language. It’s designed for safety.”

In all fairness, ethereum developers are well aware of the limitations of Solidity and the virtual machine built to execute Solidity’s code. Called eWASM, the next major ethereum upgrade dubbed ethereum 2.0 will replace ethereum’s virtual machine and enable developers to code in multiple different programming languages.

Even so, Popejoy remained skeptical about eWASM and ethereum 2.0 saying the criticisms of ethereum’s virtual machine and Solidity “could have been addressed a long time ago” but weren’t – due to poor leadership.

“I wouldn’t consider them competitors but as it is, I consider them legacy,” said Popejoy about ethereum. “They did a good job in getting smart contracts out there and getting people thinking about it but that’s going to be a footnote.”

New competition

The new competitors differ from Solidity by placing a stronger emphasis on security as opposed to immutability and unstoppability.

“We’re building a platform with a security model that normal developers can understand,” said Agoric’s Tribble. “To us, the biggest problem with ethereum and Solidity is they have the wrong security model. Even security experts can’t get it right.”

Unlike Solidity, both Pact and SES employ an object-capability security model. This means that permissions in a smart contract can be dynamically and rapidly updated to give users access to different parts of application data in a safe way.

Tribble describes the model similar to being able to give your car keys over to a valet without also handing over the rights to car ownership.

Said Tribble:

“That’s typical of identity-based access control where the model of security used is such that the authority that I’m able to give you is either too much or too little. It’s not appropriate for the business interaction we’re trying to have.”

In Tribble’s view, porting object-capability security to smart contracts is the kind of innovation that will signal to the rest of the mainstream developer community that the blockchain industry is ready for mass adoption.

“For mainstream folks, having people that are addressing different parts of the market and visibly overlapping as competitors is actually healthy,” said Tribble. “That means there’s a real market.”

From the perspective of Manian, Cosmos is the ecosystem that can support and host this fast-growing market for smart contracts and decentralized application development. At the same time, he warns that in his view, Cosmos will not and simply cannot replace ethereum entirely because ethereum is much more than a technology.

“Ethereum is so much more than software. Ethereum, the ethereum community, the users of the ethereum blockchain, the faith people have in the core developers. All of that is wrapped up into one thing and that is the ethereum user experience,” Manian said, adding:

“We’re just creating new developer possibilities.”

Project Summary/Abstract The identification of environmental factors such as commensal bacterial metabolites that modulate immune responses could provide therapeutic targets for immune-driven diseases. Indeed T helper 17 (Th17) cells, a major immune cell type involved in autoimmunity, are regulated by the microbiota. Our long-term goal is to identify immune-modulatory members of the microbiota and understand the mechanisms whereby they influence the immune system in diverse environmental contexts. Here, we propose a distinct mechanism of microbial-driven Th17 induction where resident gut bacteria produce metabolites that traverse the gut barrier resulting in Th17 activation. Moreover, we hypothesize that this immune manipulation is altered by the diet. These hypotheses stem from our preliminary studies on the prevalent gut bacteria, Eggerthella lenta, whose levels are increased in patients with the Th17 driven disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We found that E. lenta colonization induces Th17 cells and contributes to more severe colitis in a gnotobiotic mouse model. Critically, high arginine conditions lead to decreased activity of an E. lenta-metabolizing enzyme, Cgr2, and our initial studies indicate that high Arg decreases E. lenta-mediated Th17 induction in a Cgr2 dependent manner. Based on these preliminary findings we propose to 1) Identify the mechanism by which E. lenta induces Th17 cells 2) Determine the influence of E. lenta colonization on mouse models of RA and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 3) Assess the effect of dietary Arg on E. lenta?s induction of Th17 cells and autoimmunity. By manipulating Cgr2 though heterologous expression and natural E. lenta strain variants that possess or lack Cgr2, we will investigate the role of this bacterial protein in Th17 induction. To identify the bacterial product produced by E. lenta responsible for Th17 induction we will perform mass spectrometry on HPLC fractionated E. lenta conditioned media, which we have shown to have Th17 inducing capabilities compared to a media control. Further, we will examine if E. lenta?s induction of autoimmunity is altered by dietary conditions using mouse models of RA and IBD and high and low Arg diets. These studies will provide insight into unique mechanisms of Th17 induction and examine how dietary alteration and bacterial metabolites affect autoimmunity. Our novel approach of investigating immune regulation with a microbial-centric perspective will aid in uncovering new mechanisms of immune regulation where the dietary alterations of immune-active microbial metabolites could provide effective therapy. These proposed studies will provide a rich training experience where our multidisciplinary approach will supply exceptional opportunities to expand skills in microbiology, microbiota studies, immunology, and biochemistry. We believe the outstanding research climate at UCSF of collaboration and expertise in these fields will steer this project and training to success.

Q:

Run command through a c# socket

I'm writing a c# application which connects to a remote server for doing stuff.
I'm already able to copy files to the client, and what I wish to do now, after I finished copying all the files is send a "command signal" through my Socket, and make the client run it.
Just for the example, this is what I wish to do:
string cmD = @"\\192.168.0.1\\cmd";
byte[] clientData = new byte[8000];
clientData = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(cmD);
clientSock.Send(clientData);

Let's assume that clientSock is the static Socket connected to my server.
In this case, I would like to run "cmd" on the client side.
Any ideas?

A:

In the end, you have not asked anything. Could you please detail what exactly would you like to ask?
Anyway, I guess you are trying to run a command in the remote server so, you will have to implement it in your C# server. To run commands, you can use Process::Start() method. Good luck!
Cheers,

Three teenagers are in jail Wednesday night, accused in a series of recent armed home and auto burglaries in Mandarin are in custody, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.

Police said Benjamin Huger, Dakota Harney and Deja Terry, all 18 years old, were seen on surveillance video entering a home on Canopy Oaks Drive at 4:30 a.m. Monday. According to police, the victim woke up to find one of the suspects standing over him in his bedroom. Once the suspect realized the victim was awake, the young man fled the residence.

The three are accused of taking a handgun and cellphone.

Police say they also rummaged through unlocked vehicles at the home, but nothing was taken.

News4Jax showed doorbell surveillance video Monday night of someone with a gun walking up to the front door of a Mandarin home. Police said that was Harney.

The Sheriff's Office said two fingerprints lifted from the scene matched those for Huger. During an interview, Huger told officer that he and friends were out celebrating his birthday car hopping. They found an unlocked garage door, unlocked vehicles in the garage and an unlocked door entering the house.

According to police, Huger admitted to taking the handgun from the victim’s nightstand while the victim slept next to it. Officers said the stolen handgun was recovered.

Investigation led to the identification of Terry and Harney as the other suspects.

Haney and Huger were also charged with vehicle burglary in a separate incident on Lazarette Court, also in Mandarin.

Summer Bock

Summer Bock is a FermentationistTM and founder of Guts and Glory, an online company dedicated to providing
clients with the knowledge and actionable skills to heal their digestive issues naturally. Her practice is
based on the premise that good health starts in the gut. She is a trained herbalist with a background in
microbiology and is certified by Columbia University in Integrative Nutrition.

Are you ready to learn several ways to get a balanced biome naturally using food? Here’s what you’ll get:

Investigate the most popular probiotic food sources and where to get them so you can help your family, friends, and clients achieve a better belly.

Since not all fermented foods are created equal, you’ll learn the important categories of fermented foods so you can make the best choices for repopulating your microbiome.

Which probiotic species you cannot supplement or replace with store-bought ferments (and must make at home).

How to get more than just probiotics from something that takes 15 minutes to make. (Hint: It has natural antimicrobial properties to crush the critters and balance the biome).

How to turn your passion for gut healing into a business that changes lives.

Successful Students, Just Like You

Don't take our word for it — check out some of the results our students have gotten from the Fermentationist Certification Program:

Oh my gosh, Summer is a wealth of knowledge, which is awesome. If you want to learn about fermenting this program gets you a really good base of knowledge about fermentation, the history of fermentation, the science of fermentation, and the use of ferments. It is applicable to health, because we learn so much of the health benefits, too. I think it's so important to learn this information and this program is a great place to do it. You can take this just for yourself even if you don’t have clients. All you really need is an interest in fermentation and the program provides all the rest — enthusiastic & inspiring community that doesn’t let you fall behind, a program that is faced-paced, but doable even with a full-schedule, and easy to follow lessons that give you a solid base for teaching, experimenting with, and building a health coaching practice with a focus on fermented foods to build gut health. The price of the program is totally fair and the payments are really helpful.

— Jenny Pandol, Health Coach, FCP Beta

In the end I signed up because I could sense a level integrity and passion from Summer that I want to be around. From a couple of conversations with her, as well as her past students, I came to a place of trust that I was/am in the right place at the right time with it all. I think Summer’s teaching style is sincere and fairly dynamic. She loves what she teaches and it shows. She listens with heart/shen and that is hard to find that in a teacher. I can for sure say that I would recommend Summer hands down as a passionate trailblazer in this arena in anyone who asks.

I signed up for this program because I prefer TIME TESTED modalities of healing. I learn best by being told the details of why things work. I’m not likely to do something if someone is telling me what to do without explaining it. Summer is great at sharing the scientific reasons why, which gets me motivated to share this work with my clients. Her wit, energy, and devotion to this teaching is thorough! Summer helps me feel like I’m a part of the group (that I do offer something and need to keep showing up). IF you have internet there is a lot of support and more to the program than simply learning ferments, which is GREAT!

— Nicole Wirth, Lymphatic Specialist and MediCupping

I’m here because I wanted to learn how to ferment. My son sent me Summer’s link on the computer and I checked it out and I was hooked! I got connected with Summer and we had a conversation and I thought ‘well, I’m not a practitioner and I don’t have clients but I’m really interested in pursuing the sauerkraut and all the fun ferments that go along with being a Fermentationist™.

Following a federal court ruling declaring the facilities not in conflict with federal law, Massachusetts General Hospital’s health center in Charlestown will be creating a mock safe injection site to help educate the public about the role they play in preventing overdose deaths and connecting drug users to referral services.

“We’re willing to demonstrate to the public that this is a safe, hygienic medical intervention,” said Dr. Mark Eisenberg, who is overseeing the three-day ‘mock up’ event, which will take place at the hospital, located at 73 High Street in Charlestown. The facility will be up and running, stocked with real equipment used at an actual site, on Wednesday.

Eisenberg said the mock drug consumption facility is part of an ongoing collaboration with the hospital and SIF MA now!, a coalition of medical, civil and law enforcements professionals who vouch for the facilities. The mock up comes just weeks after a federal judge found that the consumption sites do not violate a section of the Controlled Substances Act.

Specifically, the judge ruled that a nonprofit’s plans to open a safe injection site in Philadelphia does not violate the so-called "crack house statute,” which makes it a felony to “knowingly open, lease, rent, use or maintain any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing or using any controlled substance.”

The mock up also comes amidst heightened tensions among the state’s top prosecutors about legality and enforcement issues surrounding the facilities. In a letter to lawmakers dated Oct. 8, Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins expressed support for legislation that would establish safe injection sites, rebuking U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling’s stance that the facilities — despite the Philadelphia federal court ruling — violate federal law.

Eisenberg said Charlestown MGH’s health center has held safe consumption site mock up events in Worcester and Springfield, as well as at colleges such as Harvard Medical School and Northeastern University. He said individuals with substance use disorder who consume drugs under the supervision of medical professionals are more likely to enter treatment.

The most compelling piece of evidence in favor of the safe injection facilities, Eisenberg says, is the fact that no one’s ever overdosed and died while at one.

“We acknowledge that some people can’t stop using drugs, and if they’re going to use drugs we want to make it safe as possible,” Eisenberg said.

Selling a Home with Mold Growth Potential Problems

Selling a home with mold growth can lead to potential problems. This week alone, we have already had three calls from sellers with this very issue. Two were from callers selling a home with mold growth in their crawl space. And one was from a caller selling a home with mold growth in their basement. So, what do you do when you or your home inspector find mold? First, don’t panic. As a home seller, you are on a time line and can’t afford to mess around with mold. However, it’s not always as bad as it may seem. Bringing in an environmental consultant to test the mold is a great start.

Mold can grow anywhere, both indoors and outdoors. In Atlanta Metro and surrounding areas, we see a lot of mold in basements and crawlspaces. Mold growth is common in these areas due to the high humidity in Georgia. Another common cause of mold is from indoor water damage. Selling a home with mold growth can block or prolong the sale of your home. Mold scares many people, and most banks will not lend on a home with visible microbial growth.

How Can Mold Affect the Sale of Your Home

Selling a home with mold growth is not something you should initially try. Most buyers will run away at the first sight of mold or mention of mold. This is due to the many health concerns surrounding mold. Recently, one of the calls we received was from someone who had waterproofing to her crawl space. The company who performed the waterproofing treated the mold by spraying an antimicrobial on it and walking away. For the seller trying to sell her home, this visible mold that was left behind is a huge issue. The company told her that the mold spores are dead from the treatment. That many very well be the case; however, the buyers wanted a test for confirmation. This is where it gets tricky. A swab / tape lift test will only confirm that there is indeed mold. Now, this home seller must pay even more money to have the crawl space remediated properly. The goal is to eradicate all visible mold and the spores.

Mold can grow in any area of your property as long as there is moisture and warmth. Mold developing in poorly ventilated rooms or areas that had water damage, should be treated quickly.

Legal Problems for Sellers with Mold Growth

Just like lead and asbestos, mold can develop into serious complications. Therefore, you should state any information about mold to potential buyers. However, this is your chance to show them you had it remediated properly. Most remediation companies give a 2, 5, or 10-year transferrable warranty for their work. You can show this warranty and let them know it comes with the house. Buyers have every right to be cautious when buying such a large purchase. But you can ease their troubled mind if you have done your part properly. Selling a home with mold growth does not have to become a legal problem. You can even back up your mold free claims with the mold testing / air quality testing that Morris Environmental provides. It’s further documentation that an environmental consulting company has done testing to verify there are no mold issues.

Dangers of Mold

There are hundreds of thousands of different types of mold that have been identified so far. Some molds are toxic and some molds produce mycotoxins. It is these molds that cause the most health problems in humans and animals. Airborne mold, the mold you can’t see, is the most damaging to our health. While everyone will react differently to different types of mold, many of the symptoms are the same. Common symptoms include hay fever, asthma, skin rashes, lung problems, infections, neurological damage, cancer and rarely death. Those most vulnerable are young children, the elderly and those who have weak immune systems. See our mold guide for details on molds, the Mycotoxins they produce and what health complications they can cause.

What Home Sellers Can Do About Mold

Selling a home with mold growth does not have to be the end of the world. Face the problem head on by educating yourself. Get a mold inspection and test to find out exactly what you are dealing with. You don’t want buyers passing your home up because of mold. And, you don’t want buyers offering less money because of mold. Your mold inspector will be able to give you a protocol of what you need to do to remediate all the mold. This will help you sell your home faster and for your asking price.

Don’t be that stubborn seller who thinks mold isn’t dangerous and buyers will overlook it. Many molds produce Mycotoxins, which can cause serious health issues. Most buyers are already scared of mold and will not take the chance. Mold repairs are just like any other home repairs. Sometimes they can be costly, but not always.

On Saturday 31st May, 26 cyclists took part in the Five Ferries Challenge cycling 52 miles in one day to raise funds for OYT Scotland. Starting in Ardrossan, the cyclists took on the first leg of the challenge in record time, but due to the traffic, missed the Lochranza ferry to Clonaig. Undeterred, they had an extra long lunch break, then arrived in Clonaig to make the 10 mile cycle to Tarbert. Their next challenge was the 14 mile uphill climb to Colintraive, taking in the breath-taking views along the way. Finally arriving in Colintraive ahead of schedule (and avoiding the cows) they cycled the final 8 miles to Rothesay to be welcomed by the Isle of Bute Sailing Club and a BBQ. The final ferry journey to Wemyss Bay was a happy occasion.. Well done to everyone who completed the challenge, raising an amazing £5k- and still counting!. A special thanks to the volunteers and to George Leslie Ltd for the recovery van, CalMac for the ferry tickets and AG Barr for the water/soft drinks.

Q:

How to prove that if $\{v_1,v_2,..,v_n\}$ $n>1$ are solutions to $Ax=b$, $b \neq 0$ then $rank(A)=1$?

Given $A_{m \times n}$, $\{v_1,v_2,..,v_n\}$ is a basis in $\mathbb{R^n}$, $n>1$ and $b \in \mathbb{R^m}$, $b \neq 0$, prove that if $\{v_1,v_2,..,v_n\}$ are solutions to $Ax=b$,  then $rank(A)=1$?

Because $Ax=b$ has multiple solutions this means that $A$ is linearly dependent. That means that $m < n$. But it is given that $n>1$ so $m \le 1$. 
Because $b \neq 0$ then $m \neq 0$ otherwise we'd get no solutions to $Ax=b\quad$ (1). Thus:
$$m=1 \Rightarrow rank(A) \le min(m,n)\le m=1$$
If $rank(A)=0$ then $dim(\text{column space of A})=0$ but this cannot be because of (1) so $rank(A)=1$.
Is my proof exhaustive enough?

A:

The fact that the columns of $A$ are linearly dependent doesn't imply $m<n$: the columns of the zero $m\times n$ matrix are linearly dependent for every $m$ and $n$.
Moreover, from $m<n$ and $n>1$ you cannot deduce that $m\le 1$.
Your attempt falls apart, sorry.

Since $v_n$ is a solution of $Ax=b$, you know that every solution of the linear system is of the form $v_n+v$, where $Av=0$. Now $v_i-v_n$ belongs to the null space of $A$ (because $v_n+(v_i-v_n)$ is a solution of $Ax=b$), for $i=1,2,\dots,n-1$.
This means that the subspace spanned by $\{v_1-v_n,\dots,v_{n-1}-v_n\}$ is contained in the null space of $A$. What's its dimension?
Can you finish?

Penco began in the late 1800’s as Penn Metal Corporation of Pennsylvania making steel culvert pipe and over the years broadened its product line to include shelving, lockers, shop equipment, and rack. In the mid-fifties the name was shortened to Penco Products and the plant and offices were expanded to a modern facility built on 32 acres in Oaks, PA. During the 1990's, two additional plants were added for manufacturing capacity in Vicksburg, MS and Salt Lake City, UT. Recently, Penco acquired a 400,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Hamilton, NC, which now accommodates the manufacturing activities of Oaks, PA and Vicksburg, MS, while still allowing significant room for expansion.. Various institutions worldwide, from manufacturing to distribution, safely store their merchandise on Penco Products shelving, lockers, and shop equipment.

Laser-nucleated acoustic cavitation in focused ultrasound.
Acoustic cavitation can occur in therapeutic applications of high-amplitude focused ultrasound. Studying acoustic cavitation has been challenging, because the onset of nucleation is unpredictable. We hypothesized that acoustic cavitation can be forced to occur at a specific location using a laser to nucleate a microcavity in a pre-established ultrasound field. In this paper we describe a scientific instrument that is dedicated to this outcome, combining a focused ultrasound transducer with a pulsed laser. We present high-speed photographic observations of laser-induced cavitation and laser-nucleated acoustic cavitation, at frame rates of 0.5×10(6) frames per second, from laser pulses of energy above and below the optical breakdown threshold, respectively. Acoustic recordings demonstrated inertial cavitation can be controllably introduced to the ultrasound focus. This technique will contribute to the understanding of cavitation evolution in focused ultrasound including for potential therapeutic applications.

Combining recent developments in drama education, second language acquisition and English Language Teaching (ELT) methodology, this course offers an innovative approach to teaching drama as a key way of promoting learning and language acquisition in more creative and personalised ways. It is taught in conjunction with the Centre for Applied Linguistics, which has a particular expertise in ELT.

Balancing the study and practice of drama and ELT as both academic and practical subjects, it is suitable for experienced teachers interested in combining both disciplines (Drama and English Language Teaching) at Master’s level, or for teachers of English as a Foreign Language. You’ll examine how drama can motivate your students, improve their speaking confidence, and enable them to use language in cultural contexts, as well as improving your teacher-student relationships.

On Tuesday afternoon, a van plowed against a crowd in the popular tourist area of Las Ramblas in Barcelona, Spain. At least 13 people were killed, and more than 80 were injured, according to mainstream news media. The Catalonia Police Department reported that the incident was a terrorist attack, and so far, two suspects have been arrested.. In the midst of the commotion because of the attack, celebrities from Spain and the rest of the world took social media to express their condolences and share messages of love and support to the people of Barcelona. Penelope Cruz, Antonio Banderas, Jennifer Lopez, Melania Trump, and former president Barack Obama were just some of the A-listers who did it. These were their reactions.

Stylishly designed and updated by Nico Rensch, with the new interior in tune with the initial proportions and character of the building. The remains of the original leadlight windows were removed, but requested by the clients to be replaced by new designs, with reference to Art Nouveau characteristics, which would fuse the new interior treatment and the original feel of the building.. In the en suite master bathroom and dressing room, where leaded glass would be inappropriate, the design theme was continued with acid embossed tones on standard float glass.

Discussion. How many pounds of potatoes? Latkes for 75 people. - v. - vermontpurple Dec 2, 2009 11:09 AM.. Thanks!. I would make it in advance and place in large baking pans ready to heat up uncovered. This will help them retain their crispiness. Fresh is best, but I would not recommend doing that big an amount right before they come. I would guess about 30 potatoes (18 pounds or so). With 2 pans going and about 6 frying in each at one time, that would mean about 5 batches--1 1/2 hours or less.. 28 lbs, perhaps a little less if you use a lot of onion in your recipe. People tend to eat several latkes even in preference over other food offered. It's a "carb" thing, but also a "holiday" thing. It will probably take a little longer than three hours to make them, if you factor in the preparation time as they need to be grated and mixed. Don't forget to factor prep time in your time calculations.

Located in Hot Springs, South Dakota, the Mammoth Site is the site of 27000 year old sinkhole and hot springs. Mammoths (mostly Columbian, but a couple of Woolly Mammoths too) occasionally wandered into the sinkhole and became stuck in the mud and unable to escape. As a consequence many mammoth skeletons were preserved in the accumulating sediment layers in the sinkhole. A contractor discovered a mammoth bone during an excavation for a subdivision in 1974 and fortunately he and the city of Hot Springs had the foresight to recognize the potential for both science and tourism. Both have been realized in a greater way than either could have imagined.

Trending Artists & Designers at Collective 2. Artsy Editorial. Matthias Merkel Hess’s project is to make ceramic objects that relate to both contemporary art and the history of pottery. He calls himself an artist and a potter (claiming not to like the word “ceramicist” because it ends in “cyst”), though he also makes drawings, posters, and conceptual objects. He is most famous for creating ceramic casts of functional, everyday plastic containers, such as crates, jugs, and buckets; Hess confesses to having particular attraction to retro or vintage Rubbermaid products, which are staples in his studio for mixing glazes. Among his best-known works are brightly colored 40-gallon trashcans in the “Brutes” series (2010). Hess also uses his body as a tool for making works, particularly in a series of bowls fashioned from the imprint of his knee, as well as through use of his “One Merkel Ruler”, a straight-edge the length of his arm..

From its lexical meaning, “Honesty” can be defined as being fair and truthful, free from deceit, genuine and real, and devoid of manipulations or misleading statements or actions with the intent to deceive. Honesty is not just truth but truthfulness, which includes the intent of that truth. It is more than truth; it deals with motives and intents. Honesty is probably the greatest of all human values. It gives us great personal benefits and even greater community and national rewards. When you incorporate “Honesty” into your life, you will constantly remain honest in what you say, do, and feel. Always expose all of the facts. Be transparent, sincere, and frank with everyone. Don’t deliberately hide important facts, this means don’t cheat. Lastly, speak up when it is needed; become a promoter of honesty.

MTX is primarily used to treat arthritis till now. A recent discovery by the researchers from University of Sheffield in Britain may have an affordable cure for people suffering from the blood cancer myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The treatment is from a drug which has been primarily used to treat inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and psoriasis. Methotrexate (MTX), the drug in discussion, is one thousandth of the cost of a promising drug which has been shown to work in the same way. It (MTX) is also stated to have very few side effects.. Currently, MPN treatment, which is diagnosed in people in the 50’s and the 60’s, is limited to aspirin, removal of excess blood and mild chemotherapy. MPN is a result of an overproduction of blood cells creating a significant impact on quality-of-life, with symptoms such as night sweats, itching and tiredness.. As reported by IANS ,.

Induction effect of coadministration of soybean isoflavones and sodium nitrite on DNA damage in mouse stomach.
We have already found that nitrite-treated isoflavones exhibit genotoxic activities toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 and 98 strains (submitted: nitrite-treated genistein). However, we have not demonstrated genotoxic activity induced by simultaneous treatment with isoflavones and NaNO(2)in vivo. In the present study, we examined whether coadministration of isoflavones (such as daidzein and genistein) and NaNO(2) induces DNA damage in the stomach of ICR male mice. Mice were coadministered with isoflavones (1mg/kg body weight) and NaNO(2) (10mg/kg body weight), and dissected to collect tissues at 1, 3, and 6h after administration. We used comet assay combined with repair enzyme formamidopyrimidine-N-glycosylase (FPG) to detect FPG-sensitive sites. An HPLC-ECD system was employed to determine 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in the stomach. In addition, we observed leukocyte infiltration by histopathological investigation, and measured total superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the stomach. We confirmed that oxidative DNA damage in the stomach was significantly increased by coadministration. Total SOD activities were also significantly stimulated by coadministration. However, the induction of inflammation in the stomach was not found. These data suggest that coadministration of isoflavones and NaNO(2) can cause DNA damage in the stomach because of the formation of radicals.

Orthodontic treatment need in 10-year-old Dunedin schoolchildren.
The prevalence of unmet orthodontic treatment need was assessed in a random sample of 294 10-year-old Dunedin schoolchildren using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need. Approximately one-third of the children from this mainly mixed-dentition sample were assessed as having a need for orthodontic treatment. No children needed orthodontic treatment on the basis of the Aesthetic Component alone, but slightly more than a quarter did on the basis of the Dental Health Component alone. The Dental Health Component was reliable and easy to use, and it assigned approximately the same number of children to the "Need", "Borderline", and "No/little" orthodontic treatment need categories. As the Aesthetic Component alone failed to identify any children needing orthodontic treatment, it may be unsuitable for use as a screening tool for orthodontic treatment need in the mixed dentition.

Structure, genetic localization, and identification of the cardiac and skeletal muscle transcripts of the human integrin alpha7 gene (ITGA7).
We have determined the structure and the exon size pattern of the human integrin alpha7 subunit gene (ITGA7), which has been shown to be affected in a form of congenital myopathy. The gene is composed of at least 27 exons spanning a region of about 22.5 kb. The sequence of all exon/intron boundaries was determined and conforms to the GT/AG splicing consensus. We investigated the different splicing forms previously described in human and rodents. The major cytoplasmic variants alpha7A and alpha7B, which are developmentally regulated and tissue specific, were identified in human tissues, as well as the extracellular isoforms X1 and X2. The recently described D variant was detected in adult tissues by RT-PCR but not the C variant. We localized ITGA7 on chromosome 12q13 by high-resolution radiation hybrid mapping between D12S312 and D12S90 and identified a new CA-repeat microsatellite in intron 1.

All-optical transversal filter with tap doubling and negative coefficients based on polarization modulation.
A novel all-optical transversal filter with negative coefficients and tap doubling is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Based on polarization modulation using the anisotropy of the electro-optic coefficient of LiNbO(3) crystals, negative and positive coefficients are simultaneously generated. Tap doubling is also achieved by using wavelength- and polarization-dependent time delays in fiber. Due to the orthogonal polarity between the two coefficients of each wavelength, the proposed filter is free from coherent interference and the synthesis of filter taps is performed in the optical domain. The experimental results demonstrated that stable 6-tap bandpass filter characteristics can be obtained by using only three optical sources.

Bronchiolitis in Infants and Children.
Bronchiolitis is among the most common illnesses in infants and children, and is the most common cause for hospitalization in infants in the U.S. This illness can be caused by many viruses, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus. It is diagnosed clinically by history and physical exam findings, with a narrow role for ancillary testing. Management is supportive, with medications demonstrating limited utility in multiple studies. Preventive measures include hand hygiene, breastfeeding, avoiding tobacco smoke exposure, and isolation precautions for hospitalized patients. Palivizumab prophylaxis is recommended for infants with qualifying high risk conditions. Recent evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics to guide diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of bronchiolitis.

The effect of sinus membrane perforation and repair with Lambone on the outcome of maxillary sinus floor augmentation: a radiographic assessment.
The present study compared the regenerative outcome of sinus graft procedures in a group of patients who underwent the repair of an intraoperatively diagnosed sinus membrane perforation to that of a group of patients without sinus membrane perforations. A sinus floor augmentation procedure was performed in 73 sinuses in 63 patients. In 28% of these sinuses a significant (> 5 mm) membrane perforation was observed intraoperatively. In these cases, the perforation was sealed with a freeze-dried human lamellar bone sheet, and the grafting procedure was carried out as planned. The following parameters were measured on panoramic radiographs immediately postoperatively and at the 6- and 24-month follow-up examinations: (1) the distance between the occlusal edge of the implant and the preoperative sinus floor, (2) the distance between the occlusal edge of the implant and the postoperative sinus floor, and (3) the distance between the occlusal edge of the implant and the alveolar crest. The patients whose sinus membranes were perforated experienced no complications. No statistically significant differences were found between the 2 groups in the parameters measured. Lambone was used in all cases in the present study. In no case did the sinus augmentation procedure have to be abandoned. It can be concluded that membrane elevation must be carefully executed to avoid membrane perforation, but that if it occurs, it is still possible to continue the procedure safely after repair.

As the following pictures prove, Mila clearly knows what she's doing.. While the tutorial may seem tailored for the ladies, Mila doesn't want you to get it twisted. These tips are applicable to dudes too. Check out the video for the ever-endearing Mila's walkthrough on capturing photo magic, and don't forget about the most important step - always be mindful of any and all DMs.

The Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth has announced that she will be the first US senator to give birth while in office.



The 49-year-old Democrat, a veteran who lost her legs in the Iraq war, announced her pregnancy in a news release on Tuesday.

Duckworth gave birth to her first child, a daughter, in 2014. The senator will be one of only 10 lawmakers who have given birth while in Congress.

Duckworth said: “As tough as juggling the demands of motherhood and being a senator can be, I’m hardly alone or unique as a working parent.”

She added that her first daughter, Abigail, “has only made me more committed to doing my job and standing up for hardworking families everywhere”.

Earlier this month, New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced she was pregnant with her first child.

In 1990, Pakistan’s then prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, gave birth to a daughter, in what was said to be a first for an elected world leader.

I said to him that I believed in my endeavour to refine and simplify my building method that I had come as close to building the greenest or most sustainable board that I could. Not that that was my initial intention. Just something I have come to in continually evaluating the process and keeping it simple and uncomplicated by continually asking what am I trying to do with each step. I have also researched and tried many products along the way.It is now a very simple approach to building a board, with very few tools and very little waste.I have shared my process and ideas with people all over the world literally and have no problem with that although a lot of people ask why. My answer why not.. So it has been a very rewarding experience to share with Shaun what I know and build a board with him over the last few weeks..

An insertion deletion polymorphism in the signal peptide of the human apolipoprotein B gene.
In this communication we report the genetic properties of an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the signal peptide of the human apolipoprotein B (apo b) gene. There are two alleles of the apo B signal peptide; one codes for a peptide 27 amino acids in length and the other a peptide only 24 amino acids in length. Using the polymerase chain reaction the difference of nine nucleotides between the two alleles is readily detectable after electrophoresis of the amplification products. The relative frequencies of the Ins and Del alleles are 0.655 and 0.345, respectively. The apo B signal peptide genotypes are transmitted in a manner consistent with an autosomal codominant mode of inheritance with two alleles.

Clinical course and hemodynamic observations after supraannular mitral valve replacement in infants and children.
We report the clinical course and unique hemodynamic findings after placement of a supraannular mitral valve prosthesis. Children with symptomatic mitral valve disease whose annulus is too small for the smallest prosthesis are difficult to manage. One option is valve replacement with a prosthesis positioned entirely within the left atrium (LA). We reviewed 17 patients (median age 10 months) with symptomatic mitral valve disease who underwent placement of a supraannular valve prosthesis between 1980 and 1994. The actuarial survival rates were 88% at 1 month and 71%, 62% and 53% at 1, 2 and 10 years, respectively. Preoperative hemodynamic data (mean +/- SD)) compared with those after placement of the supraannular mitral prosthesis were as follows: "a" wave to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure gradient 17 +/- 5 versus 4 +/- 4 mm Hg (p = 0.003), mean LA pressure 25 +/- 6 versus 20 +/- 6 mm Hg (p = 0.07), "a" wave 30 +/- 6 versus 19 +/- 5 mm Hg (p = 0.006), "v" wave 28 +/- 5 versus 30 +/- 9 mm Hg (p = 0.31), mean pulmonary artery pressure 54 +/- 19 versus 42 +/- 15 mm Hg (p = 0.07) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 14 +/- 5 versus 16 +/- 4 mm Hg (p = 0.12). Supraannular mitral valve replacement provides relief of mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation. However, LA to left ventricular early diastolic gradients with large atrial "v" waves contribute to elevated mean LA pressures in the absence of prosthetic valve obstruction or regurgitation. As a result of this unexpected finding, associated left heart obstructive lesions and pulmonary and left ventricular end-diastolic hypertension, the outlook remains poor.

Milk River Flowform . . . On the road in the American Northwest.. Oil or Water?. Personally, I feel very strongly that, after 1600 K (about a thousand miles). of being constantly on the lookout for even the smallest source of potable. water, it might be wise to put the rising concerns about running. out of oil in their proper perspective. Do we wish to pursue the path. of endless resource wars, which Cheney, Bush, et al. suggest are a matter. of absolute necessity. Or shall we follow an alternative path, a via natura,. which to me seems so very much more reasonable. This would be a path which. conserves in the deepest sense. It is a path which sees water and watersheds. as sacred. And it is a path which protects and restores the great North American. tallgrass prairie and mountain forests so that the rushing waters will continue. to flow with conviviality and energy into our children's future.. What could be more important than this?

Graphene nanoFlakes with large spin.
We investigate, using benzenoid graph theory and first-principles calculations, the magnetic properties of arbitrarily shaped finite graphene fragments to which we refer as graphene nanoflakes (GNFs). We demonstrate that the spin of a GNF depends on its shape due to topological frustration of the pi-bonds. For example, a zigzag-edged triangular GNF has a nonzero net spin, resembling an artificial ferrimagnetic atom, with the spin value scaling with its linear size. In general, the principle of topological frustration can be used to introduce large net spin and interesting spin distributions in graphene. These results suggest an avenue to nanoscale spintronics through the sculpting of graphene fragments.

[Brain tumors in childhood].
Central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the most common solid neoplasms in childhood and the second most common malignancies after leukemia in the pediatric age group. Supratentorial tumors are more common in children younger than 2 years old and in adolescents, whereas in patients between 2 and 12 years of age brain tumors originating in the posterior fossa dominate. This implies a relationship between the type of tumor, its location and the age of the patient, which has to be considered in differential diagnoses. Medulloblastoma represents the most common malignant brain tumor in childhood. In the posterior fossa medulloblastomas are approximately as frequent as astrocytomas. Supratentorial astrocytomas are by far the main tumor type. In this report some typical CNS neoplasms in children are discussed and their neuroradiological features are demonstrated.

Noah Regnery, from Pizza Port San Clemente in Orange County, Calif., pours a glass of his Pseudo IPA beer at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver. Regnery won gold medals for two of his pale ales. India Pale Ale is among the most popular styles of craft beer, and the IPA categories are among the most hard-fought at beer contests.

The quest for top honors in American craft brewing has come here, to a hotel ballroom marked “restricted access.”

More than 140 bottles of American-style India Pale Ale sit stacked in donated Bud Light and King Cobra boxes, labors of hop love brewed by a cast of characters that includes an organic chemist, a man with a grim reaper tattoo and a guy who wants to make a beer that tastes like orange sherbet mixed with hot fudge ice cream.

During the next nine hours, beer identified only by number will get sniffed, scrutinized, swallowed and spit out by judges at the 29th annual Great American Beer Festival, the world’s largest beer competition.

Only one American-style IPA will win gold, making it the craft beer equivalent of winning “American Idol.” Since 2001, no other contest category has been as competitive. “Every brewer wants this one,” as one judge put it.

It would be enough to say that Ajiri tea, handpicked from small Kenyan farms, has a lovely, smooth quality that we adore. But there’s so much more: The company aims to employ Kenyan women (ajiri means “to employ” in Swahili); these women make the tea boxes by hand with dried bark from banana trees; each box has a removable label that can double as a greeting card; and the company’s profits support orphan education in Kenya.

Mount Pinatubo is the delightful result of a savage disaster. A deadly eruption of the 1990s left a humongous crater lake and dramatic lahar cliffs.. Jump inside an open-air four-wheel drive with your private guide and plough across the lahar landscape, thrashing over rocky terrain and volcanic ash. It’s an exhilarating adventure and you haven’t reached the foot of Mt Pinatubo yet.. Leaping over river crossings and clinging onto rocks, you finally reach the summit, and you’re flabbergasted by the colour of the crater water. It’s almost too blue to be true, so you take a leisurely dip. The cerulean lake contrasting against the colourless landscape feels otherworldly.

FITaos Mountain Camps. Please be patient as we wait and see what happens with the pandemic. We want nothing more than to have programs this summer but need to wait until we have the clearance from the Governor of the State of New Mexico to safely do so. We are currently reworking our summer schedule. We are canceling all overnights and out of town trips. Our sessions will be much smaller than usual (5 campers to one Lead Instructor) and will only be open to local community members per Governor’s orders. This means children who live and attend school in Taos can come to camp with us this summer. Space will be very limited and we are working on how to handle registration. Please stay tuned!.

2018 marked big changes for transit in St. Louis. The first new MetroLink station in more than 10 years opened in the Cortex Innovation District, the region’s bridges and highways underwent major construction, and dockless bikes and scooters landed on city streets.

More changes are on the way for 2019, especially for frequent public transit riders. By fall, bus routes and schedules will start changing as part of Metro’s plan to overhaul bus service on the Missouri side of the St. Louis region. The agency also plans to make public transit rides easier by improving technology and safety across the Metro system.

Metro executive director Jessica Mefford-Miller said that many of the changes coming in 2019 focus on creating a “rider-centric revolution” that will change the transit experience, such as adding WiFi on buses and other features riders have requested.

Here’s what to expect in 2019:

WiFi to expand across MetroBus and MetroLink

Metro started testing wireless internet service on 20 buses in December. That pilot program will continue into the new year, then expand to the full bus system in 2019. MetroLink trains will also begin testing WiFi service in the first quarter of 2019.

Fare gates and other updates to safety and security

Metro started a safety and security assessment in 2018, and the final report will be released in January. Mefford-Miller said the agency plans to start implementing recommendations from the study this year.

Fare gates were added in 2018 at three MetroLink stations, controlling access to the platforms by channeling customers through smaller entrance points that have fare inspectors and security guards. In 2019 Metro will improve the design of those stations and add fare gates to stations in the Central West End and Delmar Loop.

Metro is also seeking a new contract for security services, and plans to have selected a company by the end of spring.

Redesigning original MetroLink stations

Early in 2019 Metro will revamp five of the original MetroLink stations: Arch-Laclede’s Landing, Convention Center, 8th and Pine, Forest Park and the Delmar Loop.

Mefford-Miller said Metro hopes to transform the stations into “vibrant spaces” with new lighting and art to “better connect our stations to the vibrancy that’s happening in the community surrounding us.” Design will start in spring after Metro determines a contractor. Construction timeline will depend on funding. The five 25-year-old stations will also receive needed maintenance.

The Central West End MetroLink station platform, which is being extended, will also reopen in 2019.

Electric bus program gets rolling

Metro won almost $3 million for establishing electric bus service from two Federal Transit Administration grants. Mefford-Miller said Metro will receive several 40-foot buses at the end of 2019, with plans to put them into service in 2020. Eventually the program will convert 60-foot buses on the most-used route, 70 Grand, to electric.

Metro is also partnering with Ameren UE to convert the Brentwood MetroBus facility to provide power supply and equipment that will support electric buses.

The last chance to give feedback on proposed bus route changes

Throughout 2018 Metro gathered public comments on Metro Reimagined, its plan to increase bus frequency without changing its budget. The plan involves scaling back the number of stops and routes, but increasing bus frequency. Metro released a revision in October that responded to rider concerns. The agency will make additional revisions before finalizing its plans, so the last chance to comment on the proposal ends is Jan. 11. See the Metro Reimagined website for information on how to submit public comments.

Riders will begin seeing pilot programs and route changes in 2019, but the majority of changes will not take effect until towards the end of the year.

‘Microtransit’ tests

Metro Reimagined will replace some fixed-route services with more flexible options. One of those, called “microtransit,” shuttles people to specific employers or shifts. Metro plans to start testing microtransit in spring.

The shuttles will focus on areas that are dense with people and employers, such as Downtown, the Central Corridor, the Hazelwood industrial area and health care employment centers in St. Louis County.

Fresh technologies to make trips easier

Metro’s Gateway Card, which allows riders to store and pay fare electronically, is in a pilot stage. Throughout the year, Metro will convert more passes from magnetic stripe paper to Gateway Cards.

Metro is working with a company to develop new software to plan trips in early 2019, and riders will also have mobile payment options.

Question Description. Explanation & Answer. Thank you for the opportunity to help you with your question!. Let x be the number of gasoline and y be the number of gallons of kerosene loaded in the truck.. x+ y =5000. Equation 1.. Profit from x gallons of gasoline= $0.15x. Profit from y gallons of kerosene= $0.14y. So. 0.15x + 0.14y = 725. Equation 2. Multiplying equation 1 by 0.15 and substact eq. 2 from it we get. 0.15y - 0.14y = 5000x0.15 - 725. 0.01y = 25. y = 25/0.01. y = 2500. Therefore y= 2500 gallons kerosene. Substituting in eq 1, we get. x= 5000- 2500 = 2500 gallons gasoline.. Please let me know if you need any clarification. I'm always happy to answer your questions..

Population-based study of perioperative mortality after retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy for nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors.
To determine whether retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (RPLND) perioperative mortality (PM) rates reported from a center of excellence (Indiana University: 0% for primary and 0.8% for postchemotherapy RPLND) are applicable to institutions at large. We used the data from 882 assessable patients with nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumor treated with RPLND from 1988 to 1997 accessed from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. These data did not include data from Indiana University. The observed PM rates were stratified according to age and SEER stage. The median age at RPLND was 29 years. Of the 882 cases, 435 (49.3%) were performed for localized (Stage I), 380 (43.1%) for regional (Stage II), and 67 (7.6%) for metastatic (Stage III) SEER stage. Of the 882 patients, 7 patients died during the initial 90 days after RPLND, for a 0.8% PM rate. PM increased with increasing age: < or =29 years, 0.0%; 30-39 years, 1.3%; and > or =40 years, 2.7% (chi(2) trend test, P = .002). PM also increased with increasing stage: 0.0% for localized, 0.8% for regional, and 6.0% for metastatic disease (chi(2) trend test, P < .001). RPLND is associated with virtually no or low PM in patients with localized and regional disease. The PM rates for these 2 groups replicated those of Indiana University. In contrast, the PM rate of 6% for patients with distant metastases implies that RPLND for these higher risk patients should ideally be performed at centers of excellence, with the intent of reducing the PM rate.

Q:

Facebook Chat, Application, XMPP gives first test account during resource request

I have created two facebook test accounts for my test application. Both test accounts have xmpp_login extended permissions. I am using SleekXMPP python library to connect (with second account) to the chat.facebook.com server. At the Resource Request phase (iq type="set" id="somethinghere"  bind xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-bind"   iq) I will get JID of the first test account as a final JID as a response from the server, while I am trying to use the second account JID.
Is there some way to tell at iq stanza request phase to the chat server, that I am requesting some specific test account jid for my client (In the developers.facebook.com chat API example the options['uid'] is not used for anything) ? I would like to create few python clients with test accounts to my application which are communicating with actual browser users through chat.
Thanks a lot for help,
    -Mika

A:

Are you using the the X-FACEBOOK-PLATFORM authentication method? I.e., using:
self.credentials['api_key'] = '... API_KEY ...'
self.credentials['access_token'] = '... TOKEN ...' 

If so, Facebook provides the JID during binding based on the provided access token; there isn't a way to request a different one, and the initial JID provided when connecting is ignored. Are you certain that you're using different tokens for your accounts, and that it is the correct access token being used for your second account?
In the API documentation you mentioned, the options['uid'] is simply referring to the user's JID, in the form the_username@chat.facebook.com.
If you're just using the DIGEST-MD5 authentication option (i.e, not setting the credentials as above) then it's not clear where the issue is. Don't forget that you can join the sleek@conference.jabber.org room for help debugging with Sleek in that case.

Avoid poorly drained soils. Prune in winter if needed. Hollies are dioecious (separate male and female plants). ‘Rock Garden’ is a female clone that requires a male holly pollinator for fruit production.Rock Garden’ is a dwarf, spreading, hybrid evergreen holly that typically grows to only 12” tall by 22” wide over 15 years. This is a dense, diminutive shrub that features spiny-toothed, elliptical, glossy deep green leaves (to 1.5” long). Greenish-white flowers appear in May and are generally inconspicuous. Pollinated flowers give way to small red berries, which ripen in fall and persist throughout the winter. Even with good pollination, however, fruiting can be rather sparse for this cultivar. Birds are attracted to the fruit.. Foliage and fruit provide good color for the winter landscape. Also

It may seem counter-intuitive, but solar panel efficiency is affected negatively by temperature increases. Photovoltaic modules are tested at a temperature of 25 degrees C (STC) – about 77 degrees F., and depending on their installed location, heat can reduce output efficiency by 10-25%. As the temperature of the solar panel increases, its output current increases exponentially, while the voltage output is reduced linearly. In fact, the voltage reduction is so predictable, that it can be used to accurately measure temperature.

As a result, heat can severely reduce the solar panel’s production of power. In the built environment, there are a number of ways to deal with this phenomenon.

Different module designs and different semiconductor compounds all react to temperature – here’s a brief intro into what to expect.

Determining Your Efficiency

The best way to determine your panel’s tolerance to heat is by looking at the manufacturer’s data sheet. There, you’ll see a term called the “temperature coefficient (Pmax.)” This is the maximum power temperature coefficient. It tells you how much power the panel will lose when the temperature rises by 1°C above 25°C. @ STC (STC is the Standard Test Condition temperature where the module’s nameplate power is determined).

For example, the temperature coefficient of a Panasonic HIT 330W N-Type 96 solar panel is -.258% per 1 degree Celsius. So, for every degree above 25°C, the maximum power of the Panasonic solar panel falls by .258%, for every degree below, it increases by .258%. What this means no matter where you are, your panel may be affected by seasonal variations. However, the temperature coefficient also tells you that efficiency increases in temperatures lower than 25°C. So, in most climates, the efficiency will balance out over the long run.

For a geographic region where temperatures higher than 25 degrees C. are the norm, one can consider alternatives to Mono or Polycrystalline modules, which have the highest efficiency (At 1:1 concentration), but also the highest temperature coefficient at PMAX. Project designers may want to consider a thin film or CdTe module – or in the case of a very large project, High Concentration PV, which is designed for hot climates, but not applicable for small projects.

How to Reduce the Effects of Heat

After the module technology is selected for installation, there are several ways to minimize the negative effects of high temperatures:

• Install panels a few inches above the roof so convective air flow can cool the panels.

• Ensure that panels are constructed with light-colored materials, to reduce heat absorption.

• Move components like inverters and combiners into the shaded area behind the array.

Further information about temperature coefficients can be found in this research paper, produced by Sandia National Laboratories: "Temperature Coefficients for PV Modules and Arrays" David L. King, Jay A. Kratochvil, and William E. Boyson" (PDF)

Q:

What do i do when i have two o more meshes and i want to join them

I'm making a guitar, and i found that the easiest way was to make the body, the neck and other few details separatly. But i don't know much about how that affects the render and all that, i think that i have to join them, but the problem is.
If i ctrl+j and join them, would i need to join the two meshes by joining vertices or i can leave them like that and is all fine?. And example, here is the headstock of my guitar, i made the cylinders as an independent mesh and i find it difficult to join vertices.
How that would affect the end result?

A:

You don't have to join the objects if you don't want.
If you need them to move together you could just parent them. 
If you decide to join them, you don't necessarily have to connect the different meshes to have common vertices. 
Think of it this way: In real life those are different pieces made of different materials and they are assembled together. The tuning pegs are plastic or metal attached to the wood on the guitar head. In reality they share no vertices, edges or faces.



Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab said a new malware named Duqu 2.0 was used to target Iran nuclear talks venues

A leading cybersecurity firm claims several venues for international negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme have been targeted by a surveillance virus, reportedly linked to Israeli intelligence.

Kaspersky Lab ZAO said it discovered several of its own internal systems had been infected by highly sophisticated malicious malware earlier this year.

As the company researchers set off to investigate the cyber-attack, they found out that the same virus had been used to infiltrate a series of other targets in the West and the Middle East, including, most notably, hotels where the Iranian delegates met with the P5+1 group to discuss Tehran nuclear ambitions.

Kaspersky, a Moscow-based firm, said the "highly sophisticated" malware platform was a developed version of Duqu, which it described as "one of the most skilled, mysterious and powerful threat actors in the APT [advanced persistent threat] world".

It added that the level of complexity of Duqu 2.0 was so high that they believe its use could only be part of "a nation-state-sponsored campaign."

"The people behind Duqu are one of the most skilled and powerful APT groups and they did everything possible to try to stay under the radar," said Costin Raiu, Director of Kaspersky Lab's Global Research & Analysis Team.

"This highly sophisticated attack used up to three zero-day exploits, which is very impressive – the costs must have been very high."

The firm added that perpetrators were confident they could act with impunity as the high-quality of Duqu 2.0 would let their activity go unnoticed.

"To stay hidden, the malware resides only in kernel memory, so anti-malware solutions might have problems detecting it. It also doesn't directly connect to a command-and-control server to receive instructions. Instead, the attackers infect network gateways and firewalls by installing malicious drivers that proxy all traffic from the internal network to the attackers' command and control servers," explained Raiu.

Kaspersky didn't name Israel as a suspect but the previous version of Duqu was very similar to the infamous Stuxnet worm, believed to have been developed by the US and Israel.

Israel has long opposed the nuclear talks, as it considered a positive outcome could have greatly increased Tehran's threats to Israel's security. Disagreement on the issue also dragged Israel-US relations to a record low.

In March, Washington directly accused Israeli spies of having snooped on the talks to gather intelligence used to fuel opposition to the nuclear deal in the US congress.

Kaspersky's revelation that venues where the 'P5+1' group met their Iranian governments were targeted is likely to substantiate the claim.

The company didn't identify the hotels and said the attack on its own internal systems was primarily aimed at acquire information "on the company's newest technologies".

"Kaspersky Lab is confident that its clients and partners are safe and that there is no impact on the company's products, technologies and services," the firm said in a statement.

Duqu was a sophisticated piece of malware discovered in 2011 having been used in a number of intelligence-gathering attacks against a range of industrial targets. It had a number of similarities to the infamous Stuxnet worm, leading many to believe it was developed by the US and Israel.

Duqu 2.0 is an evolution of the original malware and is believed to have been created by the same group of attackers by Symantec, and is once again being used to hit very specific targets including the P5+1 nuclear talks and the events marking the 70th anniversary event of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.

The highly stealthy malware would have gone completely undetected while gathering a lot of highly sensitive information before uploading that data remotely to command-and-control servers.

I had to identify an unknown in the lab and it was a UV active acid with a melting point of 133C-135C. Sodium fusion test revealed no heteroatoms so the only compound that fits the criteria is cinnamic acid but although the IR matches that of cinnamic acid, the NMR doesn't. Also cinnamic acid is white, this stuff was orangy brown. I never took an actual NMR though, thats just the NMR they gave us to go with the compound so maybe they made a mistake. Any idea what compound this NMR is for? There are 2 singlets so already it can't be cinnamic acid can it?

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Gov. Ron DeSantis’ proposal to set a minimum $47,500 salary for public-school teachers received a boost Thursday when it was backed by the Florida School Boards Association and the Florida Association of District School Superintendents.

The two groups issued a news release that said DeSantis’ $602 million proposal “sends a clear message that Florida truly values the role and importance” of teachers.

“We applaud the governor for making education a top priority and see his teacher salary proposal as a step in the right direction towards attracting the best talent to the state of Florida,” Florida School Boards Association President Tim Weisheyer, a member of the Osceola County School Board, said in a prepared statement.

DeSantis has made a top priority of the minimum teacher salary as lawmakers prepare for the 2020 legislative session, which starts Jan. 14.

House and Senate leaders will consider the teacher-pay proposal as they draw up a budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, which starts July 1.

With Every Breath I Take, I’m Finally Starting To Love Myself

As I play rewind inside my mind, I can never remember a time in which I truly loved myself. My childhood’s thin, fragile skin barely protected me from the words they hurled at at me or their piercingly judgemental dagger eyes. The avalanche of stones bullies hurled at me buried me in negativity and self-doubt. By the time I blossomed into adulthood, the damage had been done, and I feared my soul was forever gone, my self-esteem permanently shattered. I’m not loving myself.

Yet, here I am, slowly rising from the dark rubble, like the sunrise from the east with each new day. As each rock rolls away, uncovering another small part of me, I find ways to embrace every piece of my being with unconditional love and forgiving kindness. Though it has taken incredible strength and unmatched patience, I am finally learning to accept all that I am.

With each breath I take and each move I make, this is me finally loving myself.

This is me finally loving myself enough to indulge.

I’m finally allowing myself the simple pleasures in life, like ice cream or sleeping in, without the overwhelming guilt that used to eat away at me. There’s no more denying myself all that I desire or punishing myself for partaking. Feeding the soul is a beautiful, human thing, and I’m no less deserving than any other.

As I love myself, I let go of the guilt and shame of my youth. I release the voices in my head that shout at me to restrict, to deny, to punish myself. I practice moderation; balancing my desires with my needs. I allow myself simple pleasures, while simultaneously staying aware of the needs of those around me. Cause no harm, but take no shit. Embrace your hopes and cravings while also showing your friends and family all the love in your heart.

This is me finally loving myself enough to celebrate and rejoice.

I’m finally allowing myself to smile and embrace all the goodness that rains upon me each day. There’s no need to deprive myself of happiness, nor is there any need to dwell on the past’s darkness. Celebrating my successes, big or small, is acceptable, and it doesn’t make me egotistical or any less lovely.

As I love myself, I let go of the cloud that has long hung over my head. I liberate myself from the belief that I only deserve to suffer. I begin to skip down my life’s path, celebrating each tiny victory along the way. I allow myself to smell the roses, to win the prizes, to climb upward. Don’t brag, but embrace the winning streaks as they come. See all the good that unfolds each and every day; the wonderful blessings that rain down from the sky.

This is me finally loving myself enough to see the beauty that radiates within me.

I’m finally allowing myself to look in the mirror and see someone who is worthy; someone who is pure. I will no longer insult my appearance or refuse compliments. Even my physical flaws are beautiful, and I’m no less stunning than any other woman in this world.

As I love myself, I finally step into the sun and see all of myself. I stand in front of the mirror, allowing my eyes to gaze upon myself without judgement for the first time in my life. I search for what my loved ones see each and every day, wanting to view my beauty with my own twinkling eyes. Look deep, but don’t search for flaws. Embrace the beautiful uniqueness that makes me who I am.

For the first time in my life, the sunshine radiates on my pale, soft skin. The storm inside fades away, and the path ahead radiates fondness and respect for all that I am, inside and out. I rise from the ashes of self-loathing into the dawn; dancing within the comfort of self-love.

This is me finally loving myself. This is me allowing myself to simply be.

I'm looking for a disc specific wheelset for my '06 Rockhopper Comp. I mostly ride XC but there are some great trails in the area with drops from 3-5 feet and I don't want to walk around the fun stuff because I am worried about my wheels. I need something that is going to hold up to those drops with 170 lbs + bike on it. Obviously lighter is better as long as it is strong enough. One wheelset I have been looking at is the FSA XC-300. I've noticed Kona has used that wheelset on some of their higher end bikes and the wheels have good reviews. Everyone says they are tough but I've never owned 24 spoke wheels and it does make me wonder about the durability. Also, could you comment on aluminium nipples; I know some people hate them. What are the major disadvantages? If anyone could recommend wheelsets that would be competative with, or better than, the FSA XC-300 given my goals it would be a great help. I have a absolute max budget of $400 but would prefer to keep it down near $300. Thanks everyone.

A few days after the race. on May 1 so I decided to take it easy, a nice 15 km ride out to the start,. a brisk (and windy) 70 km ride, some coffee and cake, and then the 15 km. back home.. I was actually going to do. a longer course, so the night before I'd eaten plenty of pasta in preparation.. I got up on the Sunday morning at 6ish and looked out the window. Rain.. Persisting it down. Ah well, methinks, better shift some of that pasta.. At least the rain let up a bit. Still a pretty wet 75 km mind. And the. other cyclists are few and far between. No streamlining today!. A nice ride out into the. northern section of the Odenwald in the company of half a dozen like-minded. souls. Not to mention the other 200 participants ...

Down-regulation of the expression of alcohol dehydrogenase 4 and CYP2E1 by the combination of α-endosulfan and dioxin in HepaRG human cells.
Pesticides and other persistent organic pollutants are considered as risk factors for liver diseases. We treated the human hepatic cell line HepaRG with both 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and the organochlorine pesticide, α-endosulfan, to evaluate their combined impact on the expression of hepatic genes involved in alcohol metabolism. We show that the combination of the two pollutants (25nM TCDD and 10μM α-endosulfan) led to marked decreases in the amounts of both the mRNA (up to 90%) and protein (up to 60%) of ADH4 and CYP2E1. Similar results were obtained following 24h or 8days of treatment with lower concentrations of these pollutants. Experiments with siRNA and AHR agonists and antagonist demonstrated that the genomic AHR/ARNT pathway is necessary for the dioxin effect. The PXR, CAR and estrogen receptor alpha transcription factors were not modulators of the effects of α-endosulfan, as assessed by siRNA transfection. In another human hepatic cell line, HepG2, TCDD decreased the expression of ADH4 and CYP2E1 mRNAs whereas α-endosulfan had no effect on these genes. Our results demonstrate that exposure to a mixture of pollutants may deregulate hepatic metabolism.

Sandy Goodspeed is willing to do lookups specifically for the Riverside Cemetery in Oneonta. If you contact Sandy keep your lookup limited to Riverside Cemetery, and please identify the name of the cemetery in the email.

Sandy Goodspeed I have transcribed and compiled the records of Bookhout Funeral Home in Oneonta ranging from 1917-2005.
The records start in 1917 as Kark Funeral Home in Bainbridge, Chenango Co.
The Kark Funeral Home ended business in Jan. 1919, and in May of 1919, the business opened in Oneonta under the direction of I Jay Bookhout on 13 Dietz St. They suffered two fires (most records were preserved); one in Dec. 1939 and at the beginning of 1942 at which time the business was moved to its present location at 277 Main St. In July 1947, it was sold to John Woodward but retains the Bookhout name up to the present time.
Copies of obituaries are attached to records starting in Jan. 1936 to present day. I only copied vital info from these. Until the last couple of years, records were handwritten and sometimes the writing was not always legible. Most all records listed cemetery burial.
Please include name(s) and dates as well as pertinent info you have such as parents, spouse or maiden name or anything that might help.
I have also transcribed the records and read the stones in Glenwood, Oneonta Plains and Riverside Cemeteries in Oneonta which would have information regarding any of these Bookhout burials.

1. Field of the Invention
The invention relates to speakers. In particular, the invention relates to a transducer unit, i.e. motor, having a diaphragm comprising a metallic section and a non-metallic section.
2. Description of the Related Art
A speaker, i.e. loudspeaker, is a transducer, converting electrical signals to mechanical energy. The mechanical energy displaces air to create sound. Since “speaker” may refer to a transducer units as well as one or more “speakers” in a full or partial enclosure, in this application “speaker motor” or “motor” refers to the transducer unit and “speaker” refers to one or more motors in an enclosure.
A speaker motor typically includes, among others, seven (7) basic components, a frame, a magnet assembly, a voice coil, a spider, a diaphragm, and a surround. The frame provides a means to secure the motor in a protective and/or acoustically advantageous enclosure. A magnet assembly is secured to the frame and forms a gap in which a voice coil is able to move.
A flexible damper, i.e. a spider, is secured into the frame above the magnet assembly and is glued to the voice coil to suspend the voice coil in the gap. The wide base of a conical diaphragm is flexibly suspended at a rim at the top of the frame and is rigidly secured to the voice coil.
A changing electrical signal is fed to the voice coil by an amplifier integral with another device or connected in series separate from another device. The changing electrical signal causes fluctuations in the magnetic field of the magnet assembly and the voice coil moves in the gap in relation to the fluctuations. The movement of the voice coil causes the diaphragm to move and displace air to create sound.
While all parts of the motor have an effect on sound quality, the composition of the diaphragm is particularly important. Typically, diaphragms are made of paper. A paper diaphragm excels at low frequency sounds, but distorts high frequency sounds due to the inherent flexibility of paper. Thus, paper diaphragms may be coated with a plasticizing agent.
In other instances, paper diaphragms are supported. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,071,828 to Glen appears to teach a paper diaphragm connected directly to the voice coil, but that is supported by a second cone in an apex region where high frequency sounds originate. This second cone is driven by the air in the air gap of the voice coil and helps the paper diaphragm achieve a high resonance.
This characteristic of paper diaphragms makes a motor sound better at certain frequency ranges while sacrificing performance in other ranges. Consequently, the speaker into which a paper diaphragm is built is limited to certain applications to woofers that produce low sounds and to midrange speakers that are suitable for everyday usage.
To produce high frequency sounds, tweeters, which may have a different structure, use a metal diaphragm. The inherent rigidity of aluminum, magnesium, or other lightweight metal or alloys permits metal diaphragms to excel at high frequency sounds. Using the motor structure described above with a metal diaphragm creates a motor that produces better high frequency sounds, but fails to produce adequate low frequency sounds.
Thus, a first need is for a motor that is suitably for a wide range of uses.
A motor with a metal diaphragm has a further draw back. Since metal diaphragms are heavier, the voice coil has more mass to move and, thus, either a stronger electrical signal must be provided to the voice coil or the magnetic field has to be improved. Similarly, to produce a more powerful motor, a stronger electrical signal must be provided to the voice coil or the magnetic field has to be improved.
A “super” magnet, also called a rare earth magnet, may be used to create a greater magnetic field that is capable of lifting a greater mass. Super magnets are typically made of neodymium iron boron, NdFeB. In comparison to ferrite magnets, these super magnets provide additional magnetic strength in a small volume, but lose their magnetism above 80 degrees Centigrade.
Thus, a second need is for a motor that dissipates heat so that a neodymium magnet may maintain its magnetic field.
To improve motors, voice coils may have the number of turns of wire coil increased. However, increasing the number of turns also increases heat proximal to the magnet assembly. Thus, a third need is for a motor that dissipates heat from a voice coil.
These and other needs are met by the present invention.

A Database would be very cool.A Database would be very cool.Just to give everyone who watches this thread a heads up - I'm finally making some big progress on a new project for TMO. It's a Tracks/Lap Times database. It will be a directory full of road courses (US tracks to start with) in which members will be able to submit lap times to, and have those lap times tied to their vehicle profiles. Each track will have lap times lists for each track layout configuration. It's going to be pretty slick. I just wanted to share, as I'm pretty excited about it and I think many of you are going to really enjoy it once it's launched.. But loosing all the history of this thread would be tragic.. 10-11 years ago, the Boss established a solid following for a very competitive track day/race car from Ford. The GT350 built on that foundation, yet still the modified OE Boss cars and 302S's are super competitive.. Lap times aren't just about vehicle profiles.

On May 25th, 2013 my boyfriend of a little over two years, Kevin, asked me to marry him! As promised, here’s our proposal story :D. Back in the day (when I was much more lithe) I did a little bit of modeling on the side. It’s been years since I’ve consistently gone on jobs but I still receive requests from photographers once in a while so when I received a request to work with J. Davis Photography, it wasn’t too out of the ordinary. I am taking an international trip here in a few days so the idea of making a little bit of money from a photo shoot sounded good and Kevin encouraged me to take the gig. I thought, “why not?” and accepted the offer. After a few weeks of grooming and (trying) to get back into shape, the day of the shoot arrived and I was pumped!

1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates generally to an ultra high-speed DDP-SRAM (Dual Dual-Port Static Random Access Memory) cache, and more particularly pertains to an ultra high-speed DDP-SRAM cache having a cache speed in approximately the GHz range. This is accomplished by (1) a specially designed dual-port SRAM whose size is slightly larger than that of a conventional single port SRAM, and (2) the use of a dual dual-port SRAM architecture which doubles its speed by interleaved read and write operations.
2. Discussion of the Prior Art
In general, SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) memory has a higher speed than DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory), however it""s size is much larger. A conventional SRAM cell consists of six-transistors, two nMOS transistors as transfer devices, two pull-up pMOS transistors, and two pull-down nMOS transistors. The complementary data bits which are stored in a SRAM cell are latched by a pair of back-to-back inverters. Therefore, these data do not needed to be refreshed.
On the other hand, data that is stored in a one transistor, one capacitor DRAM cell gets degraded over a period of time due to charge leakage. Therefore, for any high-speed operation, especially when the required memory density is low, SRAM memory is always the memory of choice.
As the speed of microprocessors has increased over time, the speed gap between microprocessors and SRAM cache memories has also widened. Many GHz processors have been announced recently, but the speed of the SRAM cache is still in the range of 400 MHz.
A four-T (transistor) single-port SRAM cell has been reported by NEC, titled xe2x80x9cA 2.9 um2 Embedded SRAM Cell with Co-Salicide Direct-Strap Technology for 0.18 um High Performance CMOS Logicxe2x80x9d, IEDM 97, p847, 1997. This single-port SRAM cell shares the transfer gates with the pull-up devices and therefore eliminates two devices per cell. This approach has significantly reduced the cell size, and surely is a very attractive design for a high-density integration. Since the pull-up and the transfer devices in NEC""s cell are pMOS devices, for the unselected wordlines, the wordline voltage and all the bitline voltages are held high. The nodes are isolated since the pMOS devices are turned off. However, the leakage charge from the internal high node is constantly replenished by the off-state current flowing through the pMOS pull-up devices. There are two drawbacks with this design, (1) the cell size is not minimal, since the is a minimal ground rule specified between p-well and n-well for placing mixed pMOS and nMOS devices in a cell. (2) read/write disturb on the non-selected cell is an issue, since their bitlines are not constantly held high when the array is active.
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an ultra high-speed DDP-SRAM (Dual Dual-Port Static Random Access Memory) cache.
A first object of the present invention is to boost SRAM cache speed by at least 2xc3x97. A second object of the subject invention is the design of a new dual-port SRAM cell, whose size is slightly larger (less than 25% larger) than the existing single-port SRAM cache.
A further object of the subject invention is to boost the cache speed to approximately the GHz range. This is accomplished by (1) a specially designed dual-port SRAM whose size is slightly larger than that of a conventional single port SRAM, and (2) the use of a dual dual-port SRAM architecture which doubles its speed by interleaved read and write operations.

Intrinsically disordered proteins and phenotypic switching: Implications in cancer.
It is now well established that intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that constitute a large part of the proteome across the three kingdoms, play critical roles in several biological processes including phenotypic switching. However, dysregulated expression of IDPs that engage in promiscuous interactions can lead to pathological states. In this chapter, using cancer as a paradigm, we discuss how IDP conformational dynamics and the resultant conformational noise can modulate phenotypic switching. Thus, contrary to the prevailing wisdom that phenotypic switching is highly deterministic (has a genetic underpinning) in cancer, emerging evidence suggests that non-genetic mechanisms, at least in part due to the conformational noise, may also be a confounding factor in phenotypic switching.

Paul Romano presents a new series of melancholic paintings for his solo show, “Boundless,” opening at Arch Enemy Arts in Philadelphia on May 1. The works in “Boundless” examine the turns that life can take and celebrate the beauty that can emerge from dark times. “‘Boundless’ does have a leaning in the melancholy, contemplating ideas of oneself through tribulation and loss and then, what remains,” writes Romano. “What is left is hopeful, the vastness of oneself, not defined by outside perceptions, or objects, or a place, or a relationship.” His highly symbolic paintings draw from personal experiences, fantasy, and mythology alike, emerging with narratives that celebrate the triumph of the human spirit..

I am so pleased to be able to offer my customers this special Canadian sapphire!. Master cutter Ralph Wobito of Stouffville, Ontario, working on a new stone cut, was inspired by gently falling snow and produced this unique design.. I continued to interpret the snowflake theme in my pendant design. A gold background follows the lines of the 10 mm sapphire with a finished measurement of about 15 mm from point to point. The addition of 6 white diamonds, 1.3mm (.06 ctw), imitate the sparkle of large fluffy snowflakes.. The stone has been set in 14K gold with a 14K chain which can be attached on either side (photo 1) or from a centre ring (photo 2).. No two sapphires are exactly the same. They all are a deep rich chocolate brown, marbled with subtle swirls of gold, charcoal and light browns, much like the granite Canadian shield they come from.. This necklace is ready to ship.

Attachments in prosthodontics are the means of stress equalizing for any rigid connector prosthesis. These attachments may be custom made or prefabricated. Prefabricated attachments are highly precise and need technical dexterity to achieve optimum results. Custom made attachments or the Semi-precision attachments are cast in the laboratory and specially made for each patient. This case report describes an inexpensive technique to rehabilitate an intermediate abutment case using acrylic and pen refills as their attachment.

[A case of nonresectable gastric cancer completely responding to combined chemotherapy according to the mode of progression].
The case was a 82-year-old man with advanced gastric Borrmann 3 cancer on the posterior wall of the cardia. Laparotomy revealed peritoneal dissemination (P3) and liver metastasis (H1). Because of his advanced age and on the basis of local findings, gastrectomy was not performed. In order to treat peritoneal dissemination with two-route chemotherapy, two tubes were placed beneath the cul-de-sac of Douglas and the left subphrenic cavity and at the same time, for the purpose of intra-arterial chemotherapy, one more tube was inserted into the proper hepatic artery. At day 12 and day 25 after the operation, 5-FU (500 mg)-Lipiodol (10 ml) emulsion was infused through the tube inserted into the proper hepatic artery. Within 24 hours following the infusion, hyperthermotherapy was carried out at 42 degrees C for 40 minutes. In addition, two-route chemotherapy with CDDP (100 mg)-STS was given at day 14 and day 28 after the operation. Furthermore, one course of FAM [5-FU (1,500 mg), ADM (30 mg) and MMC (10 mg)] therapy was initiated five weeks after the operation. Although no further chemotherapy was performed thereafter, both gastric endoscopy and CT scanning disclosed complete disappearance of the tumor one year after the operation. This result suggests that combined chemotherapy according to the part of progression is effective for advanced gastric cancer.

.. Called Pego, and judging by the illustration, the beast was terrifying with fangs in its beak and sharp quills down it’s back. But it would have weighed less than a house cat and was a herbivore – speculation is that the fangs were for fighting during mating competitions.. The fossil was surprisingly well preserved in volcano ash, allowing Dr. Sereno to study the bristles in addition to the bones. And the reason for this discovery is the Doctor finally pulled the fossil out of his desk drawer. It had been sitting there for 50 years collecting dust. Now, he is moving on to the second drawer.

The Iceberg is a high density housing project in Denmark inspired by the aesthetic of floating icebergs. The project and its unique design was put together by the collaborative efforts 4 international firms, CEBRA and JDS both based in Denmark, Amsterdam based SeARCH and the French Louis Paillard Architects.. Situated on the Aarhus harbour in Denmark, the multi-storey development covers 21 500 sqm with the highest point peaking at 8 stories. It was completed in 2013, over a construction period of about 5 years and at a build cost of € 32 600 000 ( N 7.2 billion). Its both a practical development as well as an iconic landmark for Denmark’s second largest city.. Here’s a description of the project culled from the Cebra website, (there’s also a video walkthrough from them at the end of this feature, so look forward to that).

Wednesday, August 18, 2010. Choices, Choices...Netflix or HuluPlus or Both?. Posted by Jeff Campbell in "Apple Software (iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad)" @ 09:30 AM. "The streaming content wars are heating up, and thus far it seems to come down to one of two worthy contenders: Venerable DVD-by-mail provider Netflix in one corner, slugging it out with ad-supported, studio-funded rival Hulu Plus, who earlier this month brought their popular service to iOS devices (and more) at long last.". I'm a big fan of Netflix, the DVD service as well as the streaming option, and now that I've received my HuluPlus invite I'll be trying this out as well. Each has different advantages, Netflix having the upper hand when it comes to movies, and HuluPlus for the TV shows. For a total of less than 20 bucks per month for both it's a pretty good package if you watch enough TV to make it worthwhile. I still wish I could get rid of my Dish service, and it is getting closer and closer all the time.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) will carry out a study into the safety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners because of fears the magnetic fields they create may have an adverse effect on health.. MRI scans are a common technique used by doctors to provide detailed images of the inside of the body.. However, they need large magnetic fields which have been suggested to increase the risk of diseases such as cancer.. HPA chairman Sir William Steward acknowledged that MRI is a useful diagnostic tool.. 'However, we need to bear in mind that the magnetic fields produced by the machines are quite substantial and that these fields are increasing in order to achieve improved clarity of image,' he claimed.. 'The exposures to patients and medical staff from the magnetic fields can be high and there is a shortage of information on possible adverse long-term health effects.'. An HPA spokesman told the Daily Telegraph that the studies are 'a suitable precaution' and that patients 'should not be concerned'.. © Adfero Ltd

In vivo transposon tagging in the nonheterocystous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya boryana.
Nitrogenase is an oxygen-vulnerable metalloenzyme that catalyzes nitrogen fixation. It largely remains unknown how nitrogenase coexists with oxygenic photosynthesis in nonheterocystous cyanobacteria, since there have been no appropriate model cyanobacteria so far. Here, we demonstrate in vivo transposon tagging in the nonheterocystous cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya boryana as a forward genetics approach. By conjugative transfer, a mini-Tn5-derived vector, pKUT-Tn5-Sm/Sp, was transferred from Escherichia coli to L. boryana cells. Of 1839 streptomycin-resistant colonies, we isolated three mutants showing aberrant diazotrophic growth. Genome resequencing identified the insertion sites of the transposon in the mutants. This in vivo transposon tagging mutagenesis of L. boryana provides a promising system to investigate molecular mechanisms to resolve the Oxygen Paradox between nitrogen fixation and oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria.

House Britten | Wellington. This Victorian style home in Wellington is positioned on a lovely large plot with beautiful old trees. The dwelling had unlocked potential and the clients envisioned the dark and cluttered house to be transformed to an open and inviting family home. The brief consisted of renovating the ground storey garage and store room to accommodate a new open plan kitchen, dining area, living area as well as a separate pantry and scullery. Furthermore the renovation consisted of accommodating a new guest suite and bathroom opening to the garden. An industrial feel is given to the interior with exposed I-beams, bagged brickwork and sealed concrete floors as well as a steel spiral staircase linking the ground storey and first storey levels. The existing kitchen and lounge are transformed into a third bedroom and the main bedroom is enlarged. All of the bathrooms received a new look with new fittings, modern tiles and fresh paint.<<

The NiceLucky Coffee Mug Warmer features a temperature control system which is a good feature to have. Basically, the heater senses when you put a mug on it and starts heating up. It starts cooling down as soon as you take the mug off of it, so you never need to worry about a power button or worry that you might have left it on. It reaches a maximum temperature of 55C which is hot enough to maintain the warmth in your cup but not enough to reheat it.. . This is one of the more compact mug warmers on this list making it a good choice for office desks. However, the hot plate is also not that large and might not be able to accommodate larger mugs. Check to see if your favorite mug can fit into the hot plate before purchasing this mug warmer.. If you’re looking for the best coffee cup warmer with auto shut off, this is our recommendation.. jpdfpspnod. March 17, 2021. Muchas gracias. ?Como puedo iniciar sesion?

Which is more valuable, longer survival or better quality of life? Israeli oncologists' and family physicians' attitudes toward the relative value of new cancer and congestive heart failure interventions.
We determined how Israeli oncologists and family physicians value life-prolongation versus quality-of-life (QOL)-enhancing outcomes attributable to cancer and congestive heart failure interventions. We presented physicians with two scenarios involving a hypothetical patient with metastatic cancer expected to survive 12 months with current treatment. In a life-prolongation scenario, we suggested that a new treatment increases survival at an incremental cost of $50,000 over the standard of care. Participants were asked what minimum improvement in median survival the new therapy would need to provide for them to recommend it over the standard of care. In the QOL-enhancing scenario, we asked the maximum willingness to pay for an intervention that leads to the same survival as the standard treatment, but increases patient's QOL from 50 to 75 (on a 0-100 scale). We replicated these scenarios by substituting a patient with congestive heart failure instead of metastatic cancer. We derived the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained threshold implied by each response. In the life-prolongation scenario, the cost-effectiveness thresholds implied by oncologists were $150,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY for cancer and CHF, respectively. Cost-effectiveness thresholds implied by family physicians were $50,000/QALY regardless of the disease type. Willingness to pay for the QOL-enhancing scenarios was $60,000/QALY and did not differ by physicians' specialty or disease. Our findings suggest that family physicians value life-prolonging and QOL-enhancing interventions roughly equally, while oncologists value interventions that extend survival more highly than those that improve only QOL. These findings may have important implications for coverage and reimbursement decisions of new technologies.

The California Department of Public Health provides thousands of free flu vaccines to local county health departments every year in an effort to limit the impact of the virus, which killed 300 people in the state in 2013.. But when NBC4's sister station in the Bay Area, KNTV, began looking into exactly how many of those vaccines make it out to the public, it found millions of dollars in waste with minimal oversight.. It's an inefficient system that has health experts raising this question: If counties can't effectively distribute routine flu vaccines, how prepared are they to respond to other disease outbreaks?.

Nope. You don't own digital games, they are rented to you and can be stolen from you for any reason. To me tracking digital games would be the same as tracking pirated games, they are very similar except a pirated game is worth more to you...Can you tell I hate digital games?. No, if the site had a way to seperate Digital Games from Physical games on the overall total then I would be more inclined, but I don't really think of Digital Games as part of my collection - The majority I have bought cheap when I have no option for a Physical alternative.I've noticed may people also add "Swag", Soundtracks, guides or even consoles, but I like my collection count on here to strictly focus on games.

Bacterial vaginosis increases in pessary users.
The purpose of this study was to examine the association between pessary use, smoking and changes in the vaginal flora. Patients using pessaries were age matched with non-pessary using controls. All candidates examined were women attending the Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, for genitourinary problems. Vaginal cultures were routinely performed on all women attending the unit, irrespective of symptoms. Forty-four pessary users were age matched with 176 controls (4 controls per case). The mean age was 60.1 +/- 12.6 years, and 15% of these were premenopausal. The duration of pessary use ranged from 0.5 to 8 years (mean 3.3 +/- 1.7). Weight, parity, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, UTI and postvoid residual urine volume were not significantly different between pessary users and controls. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was noted in 32% of pessary users, versus 10% of controls. The relative risk of developing BV in pessary users was 3.3 (OR, 4.37; 95% CI, 2.15-9.32), P = 0.0002. Smoking independently affected the vaginal flora, increasing the relative risk of developing BV to 2.9 (OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 2.05-8.25), P = 0.0013. It was concluded that pessary use is a very effective and conservative method for the treatment of genital prolapse. However, we found that the presence of a foreign body was associated with changes in the vaginal flora, thereby increasing the odds of developing bacterial vaginosis to 4.37; this was further compounded by smoking.

1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to an X-ray imaging apparatus that uses a multiple X-ray source, and in particular to an apparatus that provides an X-ray tomographic image.
2. Description of the Related Art
A multiple X-ray source that uses carbon nanotubes as cold cathodes is known. This publicly-known X-ray emission apparatus forms a two-dimensional X-ray source by using multiple X-ray tubes utilizing carbon nanotubes as cathodes that emit electrons and disposing X-ray radiation windows, for collecting the X-rays from the X-ray tube, in a two-dimensional arrangement. The X-rays emitted from the two-dimensional X-ray source of the X-ray emission apparatus pass through a subject and are irradiated upon an X-ray image detector. The X-ray image detector generates an image signal of the X-ray image based on the intensity of the irradiated X-rays. A collimater, in which capillaries are arranged two-dimensionally in a sieve-like form, is disposed between the two-dimensional X-ray source of the X-ray emission apparatus and the subject, so that the axial direction of the capillaries follows the same direction as the direction between the two-dimensional X-ray source and the subject (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-089445 (called “Patent Document 1” hereinafter)).
Meanwhile, a technique whereby a tomographic image of a subject is calculated based on transmitted X-ray images created using multiple X-ray sources is known. In this publicly-known technique, a radiation source that irradiates a target surface with an electron beam, causing the emission of X-rays, and forms the X-rays into beam form by passing them through a collimater hole, is used. Many collimater holes are provided on the surface. The X-rays that pass through the subject are sequentially detected by a radiation detector, while scanning the electron beam and sequentially switching the collimater hole. A transmitted image forming means obtains transmitted image information based on the detection signals from the radiation detector that hold subject image information for each pixel point. Because the X-rays enter into the radiation detector directly from the collimater holes, and almost no scattering rays enter, no scattering ray information is included in the transmitted image information; thus, three-dimensional image information that includes no scattering ray information can be obtained (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-060835 (hereinafter called “Patent Document 2”)).
The X-ray imaging system disclosed in Patent Document 2 is formed in a quadrangular cone shape, as viewed in the direction extending from the focal point to the detector. The detection target is therefore captured over a wide range in regions close to the detector, and over a narrow range in regions far from the detector. When this phenomenon is observed in the vicinity of the X-ray sources, projection data of the detection target cannot be acquired in the pitch interval between multiple X-ray sources. In other words, data missing regions arise in the pitch areas between X-ray sources. This problem becomes more marked the larger the enlargement rate of the imaging system is.
Another problem is the reciprocal relationship between scattering ray removal and X-ray usage efficiency. In conventional X-ray imaging, the cone angles of the quadrangular cone-shape formed by the X-ray beam are enlarged, increasing the X-ray usage efficiency, and a large subject region is captured at one time. However, when a large region is irradiated with X-rays at one time, the resolution of the image decreases due to scattering rays. Although a scattering ray suppression grid can be used to suppress such scattering rays, the scattering ray suppression grid is disadvantageous because it dampens valid straight rays as well. Patent Document 2 therefore reduces the cone angles, which reduces the scattering rays, but reducing the cone angles also causes a drop in the X-ray usage efficiency.

The same group of developers that recently bought the old Dixie Brewing warehouse on Tulane Avenue is hoping to demolish an old Pepsi-Cola plant on the same street. Mid-City Messenger reports that there’s resistance to the request.. The owner of the building is 2537 Tulane Properties, which is connected with the New York-based real estate development firm The Feil Company. A contractor with Feil made the demolition request for the building, which has been vacant since Hurricane Katrina, at the Neighborhood Conservation District Advisory Committee this week. Staff are advocating for the building to be preserved.. The contractor said the company does not know what they plan to do with the building yet, but they are interested in "apartment buildings, but also in hotels and in retail development." So, anything, really.. Ultimately, the NCDAC staff decided to defer the issue for two weeks to give the owner time to develop a more complete plan.

What you eat before and after you exercise makes a big difference in your performance and recovery, especially if you're an athlete. This training diet from the Iowa State University suggests carb-rich meals before, light snacks during, and fluid replacement after exercising.

The sports nutrition article states that it's not just the pre-exercise meal alone but the meals you eat in the 2 to 3 days before you exercise that fuel your muscles. So it's important to eat high-energy meals a couple of days before serious training or an event (track meet or basketball game, for example).

Although what you should eat would vary by the kind of exercise or activity you're doing—and how intensely—the cornerstone of an athlete's diet is carbohydrates. Avoid high fat and protein diets, since they won't provide energy for your exercise. Update: the article is targeted for athletes who are training for competition, so your mileage may vary. Although it recommends carbohydrates be your primary food source, if you look at the suggested meals in the article for afternoon and evening events, at least, proteins like eggs and chicken are included.

As to when you should eat specific foods, the general guidelines are to eat a solid meal 4 hours before exercising or a liquid meal 2-3 hours before. Within 1-2 hours before exercise, try a high carb/energy drink or fluid replacement drink. If you have less than an hour before activity, just have water or a fluid replacement drink.

During an event, go for water, and don't bother with energy drinks—they don't increase performance for exercises under 90 minutes.

After you exercise, get some carbs (from fruits, sports drinks, smoothies, juices, etc.) within 15 minutes to restore glycogen. Within 2 hours of exercise, go for a carbohydrate-rich meal combined with lean protein. This recommendation contrasts with one we've previously seen about low-carb meals providing health benefits post-workout by increasing insulin sensitivity, making it easier for the body to store sugar in muscles for fuel.

I have an executable I'm working on, and I'm using the active template library function AtlHresultFromLastError(). In the project settings i chose to link to atl.lib. However when i compile, it doesn't recognize the function. What do i need to do?. I noticed that MSDN discusses how atl.lib makes it easier to program with COM, does that mean that I need to port my existing program over to a COM application? Does this take a lot of work? (I'm using MFC/Console on top of all that)

Designed for a Filmmaker as a place of inspiration and work, the structure is essentially a cast-in-place concrete box, intended to be a strong and neutral canvas allowing the flexibility to adapt and develop the space as needed.

Utilising an industrial take on minimalist interior styling, the space features mid-century, sculptural furnishings, a feature-wall bookshelf, grand piano and a fireman’s pole from the loft to ground level for the ultimate easy access. The double height, floor to ceiling windows allows optimal natural light, and provides an uninterrupted view of the surrounding lush green landscape.

Incorporating a structurally self-sufficient loft, constructed of ½-inch steel plates folded and welded in an ‘origami’ fashion, the space is as much a tree house as a serious and creative workspace. Needless to say, I know where I’m headed the next time I need to get the creative juices flowing…

Another fried chicken fast food restaurant has arrived in Singapore, and this is one which came all the way from the UAE. ChicKing first established its name in the Middle East and India, and now plans to reach out to Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.

With big brother KFC and other established chicken eateries such as America’s Popeye Chicken & Biscuit, Korea’s BBQ Chicken and Singapore’s very own Arnold Fried Chicken’s having their respective fan bases, how does ChicKing fare?

With a tagline like “Real Recipe, Real Taste, Real Fried Chicken”, you would expect much. I ordered a Royal Snack ($6.50) which included a standard 2-piece chicken, mash potato, coleslaw and soft drink. Firstly, I was kind of disappointed with the size of the chicken – small, shrivelled and shrunken. I must say, however, the taste changed my initial impression!

Optimising the release rate of naproxen liqui-pellet: a new technology for emerging novel oral dosage form.
Liqui-pellet is a new dosage form stemming from pelletisation technology and concept from liquisolid technology. In spite of liqui-pellet overcoming a major hurdle in liquisolid technology through achieving excellent flow property with high liquid load factor, the formulation requires to be optimised in order to improve drug release rate. Liqui-pellets of naproxen containing Tween 80, Primojel, Avicel and Aerosil were extruded and spheronised. Flowability test confirmed that all liqui-pellet formulations have excellent-good flow property (Carr's index between 3.9-11.17%), including liqui-pellets with a high liquid load factor of 1.52, where 38% of the total mass is co-solvent. This shows a relatively high liquid load factor can be achieved in liqui-pellet without compromising the flowability, which is one of the key novelty of this work. It was found that the improved drug release rate was due to the remarkably improved disintegration of the supposedly non-disintegrating microcrystalline-based pellet; the optimised liqui-pellet seems to explode into fragments in the dissolution medium. At pH 1.2, the optimised formulation had ~ 10% more drug release than non-optimised formulation after 2 h, and at pH 7.4, the drug release of the optimised pellet was nearing 100% at ~ 15 min, whereas the none-optimised pellet only achieved ~ 79% drug release after 2 h. DSC and XRPD indicated an increase in the dissolution rate could be due to molecularly dispersion of naproxen in the pellets. Overall results showed that liqui-pellet exhibited an enhanced drug release and the capacity for high liquid load factor whilst maintaining excellent flowability, rendering it a potentially commercially feasible drug delivery system.

Q:

Difficult page make-up with centered elastic blocks

I have 3 blocks: one wrapper and 2 other inside the wrapper. Inside-blocks have same size. 
Wrapper is elastic and its width is being changed during window resizing. 2 blocks inside wrapper are elastic too. Each of these 2 inside blocks has min-width property. 
When wrapper is wide enough inside blocks are positioned in one line one after another. But when wrapper becomes too narrow blocks are positioned in 2 lines.  
The final aim you can see on the picture below:
alt text http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/9006/nessview.png
Important moment: as you can see on the third block, when blocks are positioned in 2 lines they are alined at center.
Question: is it possible to do this make-up using just html and css?

A:

Something like this works in IE 7 & FF 3 for me:

<div style="width: 50%; min-width: 300px; float: left; background: blue">Test</div>

Problem is it won't center align when shrunk, and IE 6 hates min-width. 
Still looking into center align...

Wide-angle lenses are commonly used in cameras amongst other image and video capture devices where a large viewing angle is required or preferred. There also exist so-called Ultra Wide-Angle (UWA) lenses, with Field of Views (FOV) of up to or even larger than 180°. A fisheye lens is an exemplary UWA that may cover up to 180° (2π steradians) of angular FOV. As such, having two fisheye lenses sitting back to back and facing opposite directions will in principle cover a 360° view of the surroundings.
Image capture systems equipped with UWA lenses have many useful applications. Examples are surveillance and security monitoring cameras, video-conferencing systems, specialty photographic cameras, and vehicle camera systems. On a negative side, these lenses exhibit significant amount of distortions that pose a number of challenges. For example, the output of a typical fisheye lens is normally a two-dimensional (2D) circular (oval for a general wide-angle lens) mapping of a 3D visually familiar Euclidian space where objects lie in real world. Inevitably, horizontal and vertical lines would look skewed and appear curvilinear, more noticeably for the objects farther away from the center of the lens. The relative sizes of objects closer to the lens look exaggeratingly larger, so that different parts of an object look out of proportion. These effects are generally known as the fisheye distortions that make it difficult to judge distances and object relationships. This is in contrast with standard camera lenses which maintain the scene perspective and linearity by capturing a planar view. Moreover, to achieve a larger angular FOV, manufactures may use a combination of several lenses. That may further introduce optical and geometric distortions.
Several techniques are known in the art to address the fisheye distortions. The curvilinear images produced by a fisheye lens can be remapped onto a conventional rectilinear display. In a series of prior art patents from OmniView and IPIX Corp. a portion of the full viewing sphere is selected and corrected for fisheye distortions. Although this approach provides a powerful tool for viewing up to 360°, only a selected portion is available at a time. The rest of the image is saved that could be available upon further selections.
U.S. Pat. No. 7,961,980B2 utilizes cylindrical projections in connection with circular fisheye mappings. As is well known, cylindrical projections stretch distances east-west. In particular, the stretching diverges to infinity at the poles. This solution would be useful for creating panoramic images when the polar areas can be chopped off, again meaning loss of information. Although it is possible to take different orientation cylinders to build several images, still this does not provide a single zero-content-loss (ZCL) image, that is, an image containing all content from the original UWA captured scene, with no loss of information. In fact, it is physically impossible to achieve full perspective correction for all portions of the image at the same time by applying any transformation.
Therefore, the main drawback of prior art is loss of image content and information pertaining to objects and their relative positioning. In certain applications, such as a security or monitoring camera, it would be desired to be able to select areas of interest and correct for distortions, and yet be able to preserve the full content of the image at all times. The present invention discloses an intermediate approach, whereby image data for all pixels of the entire UWA lens captured image is maintained to prevent any loss of information after the mapping that corrects for distortions to a certain level, as much as theoretically allowed. Furthermore, a locally adaptive transformation can be applied to the regions of interest that aims to partially restore the distortions caused by the UWA lens. Partial image restoration has the objective of giving a reasonable indication of the object and its relationships to the surroundings, not a strict full-image perspective correction. This solution will be particularly useful for video monitoring applications where a full view of the surveillance must be available for every image frame, yet it would be possible to transform objects of interest.

WARNING!

There is a possibility that you could brick your NAS with these instructions. Please make sure that you read the entire page carefully. There is also the possibility that you could unbrick your Kurobox with these instructions.

In general, you need to move into the include directory and do a ./configure and make install and then move into the jtag directory and do a ./configure, make, and make install as root. You will also need to copy the data/motorola/mpc8241 directory to /usr/local/share/jtag/.

You can start JTAG tools with the command "jtag".

Attach your JTAG cable and start your Kuro

The cable attaches to the component side of the board. That means you will need to remove the four screws that hold the board in place to attach the cable. Make sure you align pin one on the header with pin one on your cable (usually indicated by a red wire or mark).

Once the cable is attached, reattach the board, snake the cable out of your Kuro and close the case. You can also just leave the case open, but if you get shocked it is your own fault. Plug in your kuro and press the red button on the back and hold it in. Press and release the power button and then release the red button (no, this does not get you into EM mode). The power, disk full, and diag lights will blink all on and then all off indicating (no, not EM mode) that the watchdog timer has been deactivated.

JTAG tools command sequence to flash the bootloader

The following are the commands to prepare the Kuro for data transfer. This sequence assumes you are using one of the JTAG cables described here and it is attached to the primary parallel port.

Q:

Grounding Yourself When Working On Electronics

I was wanting to discuss if using a wrist strap connected to a in unpainted screw on a pc power supply (this screw is a mounting screw it is not touching anything inside the power supply) that is not connected or mounted to a computer as a grounding device to avoid static electricity damaging components.
Of course the power would be switched off but it would be connected to the outlet.
Would this be an effective grounding procedure?
Would this still cause static electricity to transfer since electrons transfer to what electronic you are working on since the power supply is not connected it it (like for instance a pc)?

A:

In addition to the other comments/replies, I'll add that an ESD wristband, by itself, doesn't provide much benefit if your goal is to prevent electrical overstress (EOS) due to electrostatic discharge (ESD). You also require a work surface made of engineered, static-dissipative material that is electrically bonded to the same ground as your ESD wristband. 

:: IMPORTANT ::
Your work surface should never be a conductive material (e.g., metal) nor an insulating material (e.g., plastic laminate); it should only be a properly grounded, static-dissipative material.
Imagine handling a circuit card that has static charge on it and laying that card onto a metallic surface.  The instant the card contacts the metal surface there will be a rapid transfer of charge (ESD) between the work piece and the work surface. This rapid transfer of charge (think short duration, high current) can easily cause electrical overstress that destroys sensitive electronic components on the card.
Now imagine using a work surface that's covered with material like plastic laminate that is acts as an electrical insulator.  You place an item (e.g., your smartphone) onto the surface, and static charge is transferred from the item onto the surface. If you now remove the item from the surface, you now have an island of static charge on that work surface. If you now deposit your circuit card onto (or even nearby) that statically-charged island, the electrostatic field can damage sensitive components on the card if the island's electric field strength is large enough.

So in addition to wearing an ESD wristband you also need to use a static dissipative work surface that is electrically bonded to the same ground as your ESD wristband, and you need ESD-safe hand tools.
Bottom line, you want to ensure

controlled (i.e., low current) transfer of electric charge between you, the work surface, and the work piece, and
that you, your hand tools, the work piece, and the work surface are all roughly the same electrostatic potential.

If you frequently work with exposed electronic components/circuits, there are some relatively inexpensive ESD mat kits you can buy.  Try an Internet search using the keywords "esd field service kit" or "esd mat kit" or similar.  Other useful Internet searches would be "managing esd" and "managing electrical overstress".
(NB: When working with electronic components/assemblies that are sensitive to EOS, never lay those items onto the outside surface of an anti-static bag or static shielding bag. The bag's interior surface/layer is engineered to have static-dissipative properties, but the bag's outer/exterior layer might not be static-dissipative. Furthermore, with static shielding bags, sharp wires on a circuit board can puncture the bag's outer plastic layer and make electrical contact with the bag's matallic-coated intermediate layer(s), thereby shorting together circuit board nodes that should not be shorted together.)

Recent evidence indicates that the prevalence of current cigarette smoking among adults in the US has dropped below 20%. While this drop is encouraging, smoking still represents the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US. Moreover, smoking prevalence is significantly higher among certain population groups, such as those with low levels of education and those living at, or below the poverty level. Therefore, efforts to target these underserved populations with efficacious smoking cessation treatments represents a vital public health effort. The overarching goal of this group-randomized trial is to design and evaluate a novel smoking cessation program targeted to uninsured and underinsured individuals. Key elements of the proposed study will be the use of an established network of community sites (e.g., community centers and churches) and a mobile unit, enabling us to reach individuals confronted with significant barriers to utilizing more traditional smoking cessation treatment approaches. Specific aims of the study will be to: 1) Compare the efficacy of three smoking cessation interventions targeting community based low income uninsured and underinsured individuals in a group-randomized trial. The interventions will include a Standard Care (SC) approach, consisting of brief advice to quit smoking, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and self-help written materials; an Enhanced Care (EC) approach, consisting of the standard care components plus a single health feedback and motivational interviewing counseling session and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; and an Intensive Care (IC) approach, consisting of all SC and EC components plus a series of 11 cell phone-delivered proactive counseling sessions and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; 2) Evaluate the role of quit motivation, nicotine withdrawal, risk perception, self- efficacy, social support, and negative affect as potential mediators of smoking abstinence; and 3) Compare the cost-effectiveness of the three treatment conditions. We believe that of the three conditions, the IC will most successfully address the needs of low-income smokers for several reasons. First, the IC program will be personalized, individualized, and equipped with an intensive, extended counseling and support module provided over the cell phone. Second, the program will combine three intervention components featuring high potential for maintaining support and motivation to quit and prevent relapse. Third, the IC intervention makes use of cell phone technology - an approach that has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy among low-income smokers in previous research conducted by the investigative team. The proposed study offers a number of features (proximity of services to the place of residence, provision of cell phones, etc.) that are likely to reduce treatment barriers while enhancing participant recruitment and retention.

RFID systems typically include RFID tags and RFID readers (the latter are also known as RFID reader/writers or RFID interrogators). RFID systems can be used in many ways for locating and identifying objects to which the tags are attached. RFID systems are particularly useful in product-related and service-related industries for tracking large numbers of objects being processed, inventoried, or handled. In such cases, an RFID tag is usually attached to an individual item, or to its package.
In principle, RFID techniques entail using an RFID reader to interrogate one or more RFID tags. The reader transmitting a Radio Frequency (“RF”) wave performs the interrogation. A tag that senses the interrogating RF wave responds by transmitting back another RF wave. The tag generates the transmitted back RF wave either originally, or by reflecting back a portion of the interrogating RF wave in a process known as backscatter. Backscatter may take place in a number of ways.
The reflected back RF wave may further encode data stored internally in the tag, such as a number. The response is demodulated and decoded by the reader, which thereby identifies, counts, or otherwise interacts with the associated item. The decoded data can denote a serial number, a price, a date, a destination, other attribute(s), any combination of attributes, and so on.
An RFID tag typically includes an antenna system, a power management section, a radio section, and frequently a logical section, a memory, or both. In earlier RFID tags, the power management section included a power storage device, such as a battery. RFID tags with a power storage device are known as active tags. Advances in semiconductor technology have miniaturized the electronics so much that an RFID tag can be powered solely by the RF signal it receives. Such RFID tags do not include a power storage device, and are called passive tags. Passive tags include at least one of rectifier circuits and charge pump circuits for harvesting usable power from the RF signal received via the antenna system. In operation, an alternating RF wave received by the antenna system is converted by the rectifier circuits and charge pump circuits into usable direct current (“DC”) voltage that can be used to power the operation of the passive RFID tag.
Harvesting sufficient power from the RF wave can be difficult since the voltage of the RF signal is in the range of approximately 200 millivolts, and a typical supply voltage for circuits of the RFID tag is one volt. Additionally, for relatively high-voltage operations in the RFID tag, such as for programming and erasing non-volatile memory in the RFID tag, a boosted voltage as high as 12 volts may be needed. Complicating matters is that the RF wave received by the RFID tag is not constantly provided, and can cease to be transmitted by the RFID reader without any notice. Thus, operation of passive RFID tags converting the low-level RF waveform to a usable voltage requires rectifiers and charge pump circuits that can generate usable voltage quickly and efficiently.

Visualizations leverage the human visual system to support the process of sensemaking, in which information is collected, organized, and analyzed to generate knowledge and inform action. Although most research to date assumes a single-user focus on perceptual and cognitive processes, in practice, sensemaking is often a social process involving parallelization of effort, discussion, and consensus building.

>>IMAGE.. I’m still writing them.. Why did I start writing historical thrillers?. The 20th century was short but catacysmic. It began in 1914 with the Great War, and ended in 1990 when the Berlin Wall came down. There’s a lot of great literature—shaped into stories— freighted with the weight of those times. I’m thinking of the work of John Le Carre, Alan Furst, Phillip Kerr. Their novels were catalysts that drove my own writing, tracing out the rendezvous with destiny of characters who lived through those decades—several of them based on real people I knew. My novels connect the dots of 20th century history, stitching its events to individual lives, mainly lived by smart woman who had to take risks to survive.. ![Alexander Rosenberg<br />.

[Effects of antibiotics plus efflux pump inhibitors on mutant selection window of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro].
To explore the effects of antibiotics plus efflux pump (EPI) inhibitors on mutant selection window of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro. In standard strains, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of meropenem, ceftazidime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin alone were measured. Then the MICs of four antibiotics respectively plus EPI, including reserpine, omeprazole, azithromycin, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl- hydrazone (CCCP) and Phe-Arg-β-naphtylamide (PAβN), were measured by checkerboard test. And the mutant prevention concentrations (MPC) of antibiotics alone and antibiotics plus different EPIs were also measured by agar dilution method. Selection indices (SI) were acquired through MPC divided by MIC. Similarly, the SI of meropenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin which respectively plus amikacin and amikacin plus ciprofloxacin were measured. In clinical strains, MIC, MPC and SI of antibiotics alone and four antibiotics plus CCCP were measured. In standard strains, the SI of meropenem, ceftazidime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin alone were >32, >32, 16 and 16. After adding EPI, the SI of four antibiotics were 16, 16, 16, 8 (reserpine), 16, 32, 16, 8 (omeprazole), 8, 16, 16, 8 (azithromycin), 8, 8, 16, 8 (CCCP) and 8, 16, 16, 8 (PAβN). The SI of meropenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin plus amikacin were 4, 4, 8. And the SI of amikacin plus ciprofloxacin was 4. In clinical strains, the SI of ciprofloxacin significantly decreased after adding CCCP. Both MIC and MPC of meropenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after adding EPI. The mutant selection window decreased when ciprofloxacin was combined with CCCP.

Q:

Can you use Azure CDN without having to upload the files to Azure storage?

I have a website where I would like to cache the few images/stylesheets/javascript-files I have. Is it possible to have Azure CDN point directly on the files on my server, and then cache them, instead of having to upload them to an Azure storage? 

A:

It's not possible. Azure will not allow you to configure arbitrary domain as origin domain to support origin content pull. The only available targets are existing azure website, cloudservice or storage account.



[Trabeculectomy combined with mitomycin C and removed suture in glaucoma].
To study the clinical effect of trabeculectomy combined with Mitomycin C and removed suture. Seventy-five patients (99 eyes) with glaucoma were randomized into two groups: a controlled group underwent normal trabeculectomy, an observed group with trabeculectomy. The intraocular pressure (IOP), the anterior chamber depth, the filtering blebs, the visual acuity and other ocular complications were measured and compared between the two groups. The incidence of postoperative low IOP, shallow anterior chamber, the visual acuity loss and other complications in the observed group were less than those in the controlled group. Trabeculectomy could effectively reduce the incidence of postoperative complication by controlling the amount of aqua oculi outflowing. It is worthy of application in glaucoma surgical operation.

gym. May 3, 2008, 01:09 PM. I was looking at this link, hxxp://, I removed the (tt, in Http), so the link isn't live, as per forum regs. It shows and explains how to do a 'fluff and buff', on a new pistol, prior to using it, or it can be done at any time if needed. I haven't done it on my keltec, PF-9 as it still is virgin in the box. Is this something that is more common than I assumed, having polished a few feed ramps and done some minor repairs, installing sights, and the like, in my day, should the average guy attempt to use 400-600 grain sandpaper on a pistol. I understand that this may be the equivelant of shooting a couple hundred rounds to "break in" a new weapon, Is it easy to feel how much is enough, my concern is overdoing it. And what pitfalls can those who have done this routine on their pistols suggest ahead of time. Thanks, the term made me laugh, I must admit.

“The technologists who built the Democratic Party’s data-driven approach to campaigning are saddened by the results of the 2014 midterms, a political drubbing that not even even the sharpest get-out-the-vote operation could prevent,” CNN reports.. “But they are taking heart in a durable truth: Even as Republicans made impressive strides in digital and data-driven campaigning in 2014, Democrats retain a culture of innovation and an army of campaign geeks that far outpaces their GOP foes.”. . But even the GOP’s top digital strategists continue look with envy at the technological ecosystem that Democrats and their allies have constructed over the course of a decade.”.

The present invention relates to an information processing apparatus for making an information processing in accordance with an input coordinate, a program that can be executed on a computer to perform the information processing in accordance with the input coordinate, and a coordinate input method of inputting the coordinate into the information processing apparatus to perform the information processing in accordance with the input coordinate.
Generally, in a personal computer having a touch panel, a tap operation on the touch panel is handled as the same operation as a left button click of a mouse. Therefore, the selection of an object, or the execution of a program can be simply effected only by tapping on the touch panel. However, conventionally, in the case where there is a desire to make the same processing as a right button click of mouse with an operation of the touch panel, it is required to change beforehand the settings such that the tap operation is handled as the right button click. Thereafter, in the case where there is a desire to make the same processing as the left button click of mouse, it is required again to change the settings such that the tap operation is handled as the left button click. In order to appropriately switch between a processing corresponding to the left button click of mouse and a processing corresponding to the right button click, using the tap operation, it is required to change the settings every time.
Thus, to switch between those processings without need of changing the settings, a touch panel system was proposed in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 2000-181630 in which if a position instruction for a second coordinate position is made while a first coordinate position is kept in touch on the touch panel, a processing equivalent to the right button click of mouse is effected. Herein, the position instruction means that the position is not only simply contacted but also the coordinate of that position is entered and detected. Accordingly, in a technique proposed in the above patent, it is a requirement for making the processing corresponding to the right button click that the input of the first coordinate position and the input of the second coordinate position are performed at the same time, and detected.
However, with this conventional technique, since the simultaneous input of the first and second coordinate positions is a requirement for making the processing corresponding to the right button click, the touch panel must be capable of accepting the input of two different points at the same time to input the coordinates to effect the processing corresponding to the right button click. Accordingly, a cheap pressure sensitive touch panel capable of inputting a single coordinate at the same time can not be employed, and an expensive touch panel of surface acoustic wave method capable of inputting a plurality of coordinates at the same time must be employed.

Red Sox first baseman Mo Vaughn and general manager Dan Duquette have launched verbal missiles over the years, maybe no more so than this past July:. Date: July 23. An interview with a Boston TV station. Vaughn: ``What would you do if you played for an organization that tried to get you to take an alcoholic evaluation? What would you do if they had a private investigator following you around? What would you do if they brought up the issue of narcotics? That's not my style. . . . Like I said, there's many, many things that go along with this contract situation besides just the dollar amount. There's a lot of bad blood.''
