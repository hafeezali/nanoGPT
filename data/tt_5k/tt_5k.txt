Novel cytotoxic and biological agents for prostate cancer: where will the money be in 2005?
In 2004, docetaxel-based chemotherapy became the first treatment capable of extending life in androgen-independent prostate cancer. The era of therapeutic nihilism in this disease has thus been put to rest and a broad range of agents is being tested with the goal of improving on the successes of 2004. Lessons learned from other tumour types will need to be applied to prostate cancer in order to harness the bounty of available ideas. Target amplification or activating mutations and not merely the presence of a target are likely to be important to the success of targeted agents. Thus, the promise of the current crop of targeted agents is most likely to be realised when pursued in the context of well-credentialed targets and tested in highly translational clinical trials that are capable not only of assessing tumour response, but also of evaluating the status of the targeted pathway. The most promising agents in clinical development are reviewed.

An emerging clinical approach to treat substance abuse disorders involves a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy whereby addicts learn to reduce their reactivity to drug-paired stimuli through cue-exposure or extinction training. It is, however, unlikely that extinction training would be consistently effective as a stand- alone treatment in populations that have abused drugs long-term because the key memory systems that are recruited during extinction training are impaired by long-term drug use. There is a critical need to understand mechanisms underlying extinction learning and to establish viable strategies to increase the efficacy of extinction therapies for substance abuse disorders. Key elements of the proposed research plan build on recent advances made in the treatment of conditioned fear and anxiety and other cognitive disorders by pharmacological modulation of glycine, an obligatory co-transmitter at the NMDA glutamate receptor complex. The specific aims of the proposed research in rats and non-human primates are to: 1) elucidate the neurobiological substrates of extinction learning; 2) evaluate selected glycine site partial agonists and glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors as candidate pharmacotherapies to increase the efficacy of extinction training; and 3) determine neurobiological substrates of glycine site modulation of extinction learning. The intravenous cocaine self-administration procedure will be used in the proposed studies because the contingency between drug delivery and behavior is likely paramount for understanding the persistent abuse of drugs in people. Measurement of Fos protein expression (a marker for neuronal activation) and evaluation with anisomycin (an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis) will be used in rats to investigate the neurobiological substrates of extinction learning following cocaine self-administration training. In addition, the proposed research in rats and non-human primates will specifically investigate the effects of the partial glycine agonist D-cycloserine and selective GlyT1 inhibitors for their ability to accelerate extinction learning and to subsequently reduce cocaine cue reactivity and re-acquisition of cocaine self-administration. Animal research involving pharmacological modulation of learning and memory is well-served by an integrated comparative strategy using appropriately selected laboratory animals. This approach is especially relevant for research involving cognitive enhancing drugs, where non-human primates can serve as a key translational interface for the development of pharmacotherapies.

Host lymphodepletion augments T cell adoptive immunotherapy through enhanced intratumoral proliferation of effector cells.
T-cell adoptive immunotherapy for stringent murine tumor models, such as intracranial, s.c., or advanced pulmonary metastases, routinely uses lymphodepletive conditioning regimens before T-cell transfer, like recent clinical protocols. In this study, we examined whether host lymphodepletion is an obligatory component of curative T-cell therapy; we also examined the mechanism by which it augments therapy. Mice bearing intracranial, s.c., or 10-day pulmonary metastases of MCA 205 received total body irradiation conditioning or were nonirradiated before i.v. transfer of tumor-reactive T cells. Total body irradiation was not required for immunologically specific curative therapy and induction of memory provided that a 3- to 12-fold higher T-cell dose was administered. The mechanism involved enhanced intratumoral proliferation of T-effector cells in total body irradiation-conditioned recipients. In this tumor model, intratumoral T(reg) cells were not detected; consequently, intratumoral T-effector cells produced identical amounts of IFN-gamma upon ex vivo antigen stimulation irrespective of total body irradiation conditioning. Thus, host lymphodepletion augments T-cell immunotherapy through enhanced antigen-driven proliferation of T-effector cells, but curative therapy can be achieved in nonconditioned hosts by escalation of T-cell dose. These data provide a rationale for dose escalation of T-effector cells in situations where single or repeated lymphodepletion regimens are contraindicated.

Ranking systems have their limitations and imperfections – we know. Yet it’s worth sharing that the latest U.S. News & World Report list puts OHSU at no. 3 for excellence in primary care education.. Fifty-five of our 121 fourth-year med students, or 46 percent, are entering residency in primary care this year, which includes internal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics. While many of these students will go on to sub-specialize, this continues to be a strong initial showing in primary care, compared to many other areas of the country. While this is down somewhat from 2011 when 62 percent matched to primary care, it is consistent with trends from 2008-2010.. Complete OHSU rankings include:. - Overall research #37 (tied with University of Maryland). - Primary care #3 (tied with UC-San Francisco). - Family Medicine #5 (tied with University of New Mexico). - Rural Medicine #12 (tied with eight other institutions)

It seems that Americans might not be the only ones to be at the receiving end of the thriving business of credit card fraud emanating from India. After the Maharashtra Police unearthed a massive credit card fraud scam by raiding Thane-based call centres and arresting scores of individuals accused of duping close to 6,000 Americans, Canadian authorities have raised alarm about 'suspicious phone callers with Indian accent.'

According to the probe agency, scores of Canadian residents have complained to the authorities in their country about marketers and callers asking them about their personal information. The complainants have also stated that most of the callers have an 'Indian accent' and tend to be pushy while asking personal information which mostly is about credit card details.

The revelation was made by some senior officials of the CBI who said that the issue was brought up during a recently held meeting with the Commissioner of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Bob Paulson.

"Several issues were discussed during the meeting and most of them focused on greater co-operation between Canadian and Indian investigating bodies. Some of the points discussed during the meeting were related to inquiries and judicial requests made by our agency in connection to criminal cases probed by CBI. While our Canadian counterpart assured better cooperation from their end, there were some issues raised by them in which they would be needing our assistance. One of them is of credit card fraud and the matter seems to be serious and urgent in nature,"a senior CBI official told DNA.

"According to the RMCP in the last few months there have been multiple complaints from Canadian citizens claiming that they have been receiving calls from people with an Indian accent. The numbers from which they have been receiving these calls seem to be originating from two-three countries and we intend to work with out Canadian counterparts to probe this matter further," the officer said.

According to CBI officials, as seen in the past, syndicates operating a credit card scam system, are generally not based out of any one particular country. Similarly the numbers from which these fraud calls are made can be concealed using commonly available technology or through sim cards acquired illegally by syndicate members.

Mumbai case

Thane based call centres, which had more than 2,000 employees, have come under police investigation for allegedly duping Americans by pretending to be Internal Revenue Service officials and threatening them with tax investigations if they did not pay up. The police has also issued a Look Out Circular (LOC) to nab Sagar Dharmesh Thakkar, the alleged mastermind of the scam which is believed to have procured almost rupees 500 crore from American citizens

Randomized Study to Evaluate the Impact of Telemedicine Care in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes With Multiple Doses of Insulin and Suboptimal HbA1c in Andalusia (Spain): PLATEDIAN Study.
To assess the impact of a telemedicine visit using the platform Diabetic compared with a face-to-face visit, on clinical outcomes, patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and physicians' satisfaction in patients with type 1 diabetes. PLATEDIAN (Telemedicine on Metabolic Control in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Andalusian Patients) (NCT03332472) was a multicenter, randomized, 6-month follow-up, open-label, parallel-group controlled study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes with suboptimal metabolic control (HbA1c <8% [<64 mmol/mol]), treated with multiple daily injections. A total of 388 patients were assessed for eligibility; 379 of them were randomized 1:1 to three face-to-face visits (control cohort [CC]) (n = 167) or the replacement of an intermediate face-to-face visit by a telemedicine visit using Diabetic (intervention cohort [IC]) (n = 163). The primary efficacy end point was the mean change of HbA1c levels from baseline to month 6. Other efficacy and safety end points were mean blood glucose, glucose variability, episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, patient-reported outcomes, and physicians' satisfaction. At month 6, the mean change in HbA1c levels was -0.04 ± 0.5% (-0.5 ± 5.8 mmol/mol) in the CC and 0.01 ± 0.6% (0.1 ± 6.0 mmol/mol) in the IC (P = 0.4941). The number of patients who achieved HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) was 73 and 78 in the CC and IC, respectively. Significant differences were not found regarding safety end points at 6 months. Changes in HRQoL between the first visit and final visit did not differ between cohorts, and, regarding fear of hypoglycemia (FH-15 ≥28), statistically significant differences observed at baseline remained unchanged at 6 months (P < 0.05). The use of telemedicine in patients with type 1 diabetes with HbA1c <8% (<64 mmol/mol) provides similar efficacy and safety outcomes as face-to-face visits.

NBC Universal is looking at “The View”-style talk shows with multiple hosts to possibly replace “The Meredith Vieira Show” as its ratings slump behind syndicated competitors, sources told Page Six. stars Tamar demographic — younger, more multicultural — to Meredith’s later-afternoon time slot.”. NBC has already tinkered with Vieira’s format in an effort to boost ratings.. The normally pretaped show was done live the week of Jan. 19, and has recently been featuring multiple guests to talk about topics like parenting and health.. Vieira recently had author Steve Santagati, former New York Giant Michael Clayton and TV host Steve Wilkos for a panel on “what your man really thinks.”. But other NBC insiders insist the network isn’t looking to replace Vieira just yet.. “With any show, you tinker with different things to see what works,” one source said, adding that the panel could become part of the program. A rep for Vieira’s show had no comment.

Springfield Partner Carole Lynch and Associate Denise M. Tremblay recently obtained summary judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiff, a former director of our client—the board of trustees of a municipal library—alleged that the Board violated his 1st Amendment rights (under 42 U.S.C. § 1983) by retaliating against him in pursuing termination of his employment and breached his contract of employment. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his claim for violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, M.G.L. c. 12, after receiving the motion for summary judgment. The judge ruled in favor of our client on the 1st Amendment claim on the grounds that the Board did not act under color of state law as its members were not “state actors.” In the alternative, the Court held that the Board was entitled to qualified immunity. The Court also entered judgment on the breach of contract claim.

Why mobile search was inevitable from 1997

Way back in May 1997, AOL finalized some amazing new technology based around its so called “OSCAR” protocolﾠwhich eventually became AOL’s flagship instant messaging system.

ﾠ

Why was this so amazing?

ﾠ

Well, it may seem something which we all take for granted in the new millenium, but at the time it was revolutionary for users to be able to communicate in real time. Furthermore, this was rolled out on a commercial scale and it proved to be a real game changer, not just for internet usage but also for broader human communication.

ﾠ

Early dominance

ﾠ

AOL’s Instant Messaging system became known simply as “AIM” and it completely dominated the market in the early 2000s. This tells us a number of things:

ﾠ

1. The developed world was eager to be able to communicate in real time, both for social and commercial reasons.

2. Business was desirous of shorter “feedback loops”, as a means of staff development and of shortening their sales cycles.

3. Collaboration in fields such as mathematics, science, education and politics became much easier, albeit creating at the same time some inherent risks.ﾠ

ﾠ

Demise

ﾠ

By 2009, however, use of AIM had largely become non-existent. This was due to a number of reasons:

ﾠ

1. Ageing technology: as processing speeds and the complexity of computing accelerated, so did demands on what was expected of AIM and its competition. New operating systems were tried, noteably the AOL XMPP Gateway. This allowsﾠthird party messaging networks to exchange messages and presence information with the AIM service. Use of the gateway is currently limited to select partners, and AOL state that parties interested in using the XMPP gateway should contact them.ﾠUse of AOL’s XMPP Gateway was and is governed by proprietary terms of service.ﾠCommercially, this was perceived as restrictive and gradually other solutions became more popular.

2. Portability: the advent of mobile phones with 3G rendered the need to be at an office or desktop unneccessary when wanting to instant message, whether by SMS or other means.ﾠ

3. Apple: Apple products surged in popularity, wiping many competitors off the map including this technology.

ﾠ

What next?

ﾠ

Looking back, it was clear that there was a desire for real time mobile communication technologies. It was inevitable, even in 1997, that technology would deliver solutions to this and the fascinating question now is how this trend will continue. It is not clear, however, that we have seen the last of AIM. Take a look at the following video for more details.

Channel 4 has appointed Alex Mahon, the former boss of the maker of MasterChef and Broadchurch, who now runs the special effects firm behind Hollywood blockbusters including Gravity and Guardians of the Galaxy, as its new chief executive.

Mahon becomes the first woman to run a UK broadcaster larger than Channel 5. She is the first female Channel 4 chief executive in the broadcaster’s 35-year history.

“Alex is an outstanding leader and a highly experienced chief executive who has developed and grown major international businesses in both the creative and technology sectors,” said the Channel 4 chairman, Charles Gurassa.

Jay Hunt quits Channel 4 post just days before decision on top job

“She brings an impressive combination of relevant experience and is brilliantly placed to help steer Channel 4 through the competitive challenges and opportunities ahead.”

Mahon will take over from David Abraham, who leaves later this year, and will immediately face the prospect of negotiations with the government over the relocation of Channel 4 out of London.

Scottish-born Mahon has previously worked closely with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, having served as a member of the advisory panel put together to help map out the future scope and remit of the BBC ahead of the renewal of its royal charter last year.

“She is a great enthusiast for Channel 4 and its unique public service remit and her recent work with government will be valuable in facilitating constructive dialogue with the new administration,” said Gurassa.

Mahon is expected to start the £900,000 a year job in October or November and will be involved with the appointment of Hunt’s successor.

Hunt is due to leave at the end of September, after handling the launch of Great British Bake Off which the broadcaster poached from the BBC last year.

“Channel 4’s unique remit to innovate and to appeal to young and diverse audiences make it an essential part of British culture,” said Mahon. “There is nowhere in the world like Channel 4 and, in these changing times, its mission is more important than ever. I’m incredibly proud to be joining Channel 4 and bring to it experience both of leading creative organisations at scale and dealing with an environment of constant technological change.”

Mahon joins from Foundry, a design and visual effects software firm with film credits including Guardians of the Galaxy and technology licensing deals with Hollywood heavyweights such as Disney, Weta Digital and Sony Pictures Imageworks, which she has run since 2015.

Calixarene Assisted Rapid Synthesis of Silver-Graphene Nanocomposites with Enhanced Antibacterial Activity.
Demonstrated herein is a single rapid approach employed for synthesis of Ag-graphene nanocomposites, with excellent antibacterial properties and low cytotoxicity, by utilizing a continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) process in combination with p-hexasulfonic acid calix[6]arene (SCX6) as an effective particle stabilizer. The nanocomposites showed high activity against E. coli (Gram-negative) and S. aureus (Gram-positive) bacteria. The materials were characterized using a range of techniques including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectrophotometry, FT-IR, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). This rapid, single step synthetic approach not only provides a facile means of enabling and controlling graphene reduction (under alkaline conditions) but also offers an optimal route for homogeneously producing and depositing highly crystalline Ag nanostructures into reduced graphene oxide substrate.

North American Single-footing Horse

The North American Single-footing Horse, also called the Single-footing Horse or Single-footer, is a horse breed originating in the southern United States. The term "single-foot" refers to an intermediate ambling gait, sometimes alternately called the rack or paso largo, where the horse lifts each foot up separately and puts it down alone.

Characteristics
The Single-footing Horse comes in a wide range of colors, including palomino and buckskin, as well as chestnut, gray, and bay.
The Single-footing Horse is a medium-sized breed of light riding horse. It is primarily known for its intermediate four-beat gait, which may range from 7 to 9 miles per hour on a trail ride to over 15 miles per hour at a road speed. High speeds in excess of 20 mph have been recorded.

Uses
The breed is almost always used for trail or pleasure riding. All Single-footers must be shod in plain keg shoes (a standard machine-made shoe) in order to maintain registration.

History
The Single-footing Horse is descended from crosses of American Saddlebreds, Standardbreds, and other gaited breeds, with some influence from Spanish bloodlines. An influential stallion was EZD Falcon Rowdy, who also influenced the Racking Horse breed.

breaks. . Swing the End of the World. Deep in the wilds of Ecuador is a seismic monitoring station known as Casa del Arbol (in the original Casa del Arbol). Its purpose is to observe the activity of the Tungurahua volcano, which is located nearby. This volcano woke up on August 19, 1999. Since then, climbing it has been banned, and it is under scrutiny. The station is a small tree house. Which can already be considered a landmark, since it is located on the edge of a fairly deep cliff. But much more interesting are the swings that hang from the branches of a tree, right next to the station (more like a large birdhouse). All over the world, these swings are known as “swings at the end of the world” or “end of the world” swings.

we used the metro but you have to change once. the pavements are not smooth if you have luggage on wheels and it is a good 5 minute walk with a bit of a hill, so takes a bit of effort.. There is a fantastic minibus service at the airport called Minibud. It took us directly to the hotel and collected us for the return. Literally door to door. The price was extremely reasonable and so convenient. Cannot recommend it enough.. we took a shuttle bus which was direct but we had a bit of a wait.. We booked the transfer with jet2.

We always have a great time when Branson joins us for our weekly Legend's dinner with Grammy & Pa. He's so full of personality and gets a long with both girls so well. :). We survived another first day of school! It was a pretty smooth morning, even Drew cooperated by sleeping most of the night and waking up to have breakfast with the girls! School is starting 10 minutes earlier than last year so we were up and at it at 6:30 to make sure we had enough time to park and walk the girls in...plus take pictures. Lots and lots of pictures!. Ava was pretty excited to go see her friends but I think as the time for leaving for school neared she got more and more nervous. She went from bubbly and talkative to a little more solemn. She did at least smile for a picture or two! :)

I have two boys who race BMX.. we travel all over for their me races and it’s become a lifestyle for our family. There is a lot of down time and the weapon of choice has been the mini bikes for several years. The first mini bike I purchased was a very well known brand and it seemed to perform well. However - I stared noticing other brands making minis that seemed equal in quality but about half the price. So when it came time to replace the bike I went with the cheaper less known brand of mini. I didn’t notice and difference in quality between the two brands. About month ago I saw a kid kit one of the races cruising the pits on a mini that looked nothing like I’d seen before. I figured some rich Factory dad had somehow found the parts to build a custom mini.. just be taking a quick glance it was obvious this mini was top of the line . Later I was able to find out it was not a custom build.. it was a Wildcat MIni that he purchased complete . The bike was similiar in price ronthe more welll known brand of mini sold in the U.S. I decided to purchase the bike and if has exceeded all’s expectations. Its smoother, faster and I would argue nicer looking then any other mini out there. My sons both love riding these bikes over anything else the have - including their race bikes which which both cost over 2k to build. You can find mini’s cheaper then Wildacat- but if they are gonna be riding a lot and you want a top notch bike this is the best there is and I’ve seen several. Until a new company emerges that can do better - wildcat is without the best bang for your buck and I will certainly be buying another Willscat once it’s time to replace the two we have now -

WOW Nathan - thank you so much for such a comprehensive review on the Wildcat Original 1B.
We really appreciate it. We strive to be the market leader in the development of Mini BMX bikes - we want our pride to be riding the best, the lightest and the strongest.

Tiny and tough! Super fun! I wish they existed when I was a kid! My little groms and I love it! Here’s a couple pics of myself playing with our new Mini freak. I’m 175 and this thing is as tough as my 20” bike and is a rush to ride! Well done to the wildcat crew for sending this gap in the in the market for young riders and adults alike. Tiny shred!!!

That’s the absolute best Edward. We love seeing dads get in on the action. Thanks for your positive review and so pleased that you and your little groms are diggin it.

[Development of direct phlebography for surgical intervention of the varix cruris].
To determine the appropriate treatment for patients with varix cruris, we performed three different methods of phlebography including direct phlebography, and compared their findings by each phlebography. Conventional ascending phlebography was taken routinely and initially in all limbs (n = 120). "Direct phlebography" developed by us was then indicated, when the visualization of the deep vein system was unclear by conventional ascending phlebography. This method was useful for the clear opacification of the deep vein system, and also was able to visualize the deep femoral vein clearly. After the precise diagnosis of varix cruris, descending phlebography under the Valsalva maneuver at supine position was carried out for the evaluation of the deep vein insufficiency. According to these phlebographic findings, conventional stripping with or without sub- or suprafascial ligation of communicating vein was indicated to saphenous typed varix cruris. The valvuloplasty to the highest valve in superficial femoral vein was carefully added in eight limbs which showed the significant reflux by added in eight limbs which showed the significant reflux by the descending phlebography. This valvuloplasty was remarkably contributed to the immediate healing of the stasis ulcer without recurrence. And compression sclerotherapy was selected to some patients with branch typed varix cruris.

BRUSSELS -- European Union ambassadors appear set to prolong asset freezes and visa bans against 146 individuals and 37 entities that, according to the EU, are responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity.

EU sources have told RFE/RL that the decision to prolong the measures by six months will be taken ahead of a September 15 deadline without much discussion.

The targets of the sanctions include companies in Crimea and various battalions formed by the Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, as well as Russian politicians like Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and Dmitry Kiselyov, a state media executive and presenter whom many regard as the Kremlin's chief propagandist.

The sanctions were first introduced in March 2014 after Russia's seizure and illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.

The EU's economic sanctions that target Russia's energy, military, and financial sectors are up for renewal on January 31.

EU sources told RFE/RL that those sectoral sanctions will be discussed at a Brussels summit of EU leaders in October.

Removal of the distal 75% of the pancreas may be done in adults without producing diabetes or deficiency of external pancreatic secretion. This procedure is often employed in the treatment of malignant and benign tumors. Resection of the body and tail of the pancreas may also be useful in treatment of an occasional patient who sustains severe trauma to the pancreas with complete transection, or with a crushing injury involving the distal portion of this organ. Little data are available, however, concerning the effect of extensive pancreatic resection upon the young, growing individual. Although such a procedure does not result in the development of diabetes, the quantitative requirements for exocrine secretion during the phase of rapid growth have not been established. This experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of distal subtotal pancreatectomy on the growth and metabolism of young mice.. Material and Methods. Ninety C-3-H mice, each 4.

The study of graphs, or graph theory, is used in communications and information technology systems for various purposes. A graph refers to a collection of nodes (or vertices) and a collection of edges that connect pairs of nodes. A dominating set DS for a graph G is a set of nodes in G such that every node not in DS is joined to at least one member of DS by some edge. That is, each node in G is either a member of the dominating set DS or 1 hop away from a member node (may also be referred to as a dominating node). It is noted that a dominating set may include disjoint sets of nodes in the graph.
A connected dominating set (CDS) of a graph G includes a dominating set and a set of connecting nodes that may be needed to connect disjoint nodes in the dominating set. CDSs have traditionally been used in mobile ad-hoc networks for routing applications. For instance, broadcast and multicast protocols may efficiently reach all destinations by restricting transmissions to nodes that are members of the CDS (instead of every node in the graph). In addition to routing, mobile ad-hoc networks may benefit from CDSs in other areas including channel access, link adaptation, energy consumption, power control, dynamic resource management and the like.
Since a given graph may have more than one CDS, it may be beneficial to identify a CDS with minimum number of elements (e.g., nodes and/or edges). Such a CDS may be referred to as a minimum connected dominating set (MCDS). However, it has been shown that the computation complexity of minimum connected dominating set problem (MCDS), and minimum dominating set problem (MDS) in general, is NP-complete. Therein lies a need for a system and method capable of efficiently identifying a CDS with the number of elements as close to the minimum number as possible.

Characterization and technological properties of Staphylococcus xylosus strains isolated from a Tunisian traditional salted meat.
The technological properties of strains of Staphylococcus xylosus were studied to select the most suitable for use as starter cultures for the production of dried fermented meat products. Strains of S. xylosus were isolated from traditional salted Tunisian meat and were identified by biochemical and molecular methods. Thirty strains of S. xylosus were studied to evaluate their catalase, nitrate reductase, lipolytic, proteolytic and antibacterial activities as well as growth ability at different temperatures, pH's and NaCl concentrations. All strains of S. xylosus had catalase activity and were able to reduce nitrates to nitrites. The nitrate reductase activity increased when the strains were kept under anaerobic conditions. Proteolytic activity on milk and on gelatin agar was demonstrated for 100% and 83.3% of the S. xylosus isolates, respectively. However extracellular proteolytic activity as assessed by the azocasein method was poor in all the strains. Lipolytic activity as assessed by the agar method showed that 76.6% of strains of S. xylosus could hydrolyze Tween 20 against 33.3% that could hydrolyze tributyrin. Tween 80 was hydrolyzed by only 10% of strains. Strains of S. xylosus hydrolyzed pork fat better than beef and lamb fat. The majority of strains had antibacterial activity against Salmonella arizonae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis.

Mobility means synching up

If you’re an IT executive today, things pretty much work this way: so very often when you get a present from a family member, it’s the latest in mobile computing devices. In fact, most executives in this business are already carrying wireless handheld devices alongside a two-way pager and a cell phone.

Of course, I personally can’t wait to have my own version of a Dick Tracy watch, which means that just about anybody will be able to contact me whenever they take a notion to do so. But the fundamental problem with mobile computing is the need for such a concept – apart from existing IT services, that is.

To make matters worse, companies such as Verizon now are giving away free Internet-enabled phones to people willing to sign long-term contracts. L.M. Ericcson Telephone Co., meanwhile, is working with AT&T Corp. to create a new generation of wireless consumers by giving away wireless devices shaped like phones, allowing people to win prizes by interacting with the Who Wants to be a Millionaire television program.

The reason this represents such an immense problem for IT is that all these executives are sure they can’t live without such devices. Naturally, this means they want the devices connected to their work environments so that they can become ever more productive.

What most people don’t realize is that this presents a huge challenge for IT. Each mobile device on the market today comes with its own set of built-in services for e-mail and calendering. In order to integrate those services with existing corporate services built around Lotus Development Corp.’s Notes or Microsoft Corp.’s Exchange, IT organizations have to invest in synchronization software that can be purchased from more than a dozen different vendors today.

The problem is that every time one of the devices this software is intended to synchronize gets updated, the synchronization software needs to be updated. And of course anytime any of the core enterprise applications gets an upgrade, you’ll also need to update the synchronization software.

For IT people, this creates an infinite synchronization loop that diverts attention away from their real jobs: to make sure that their company has a working IT infrastructure. This loop exists because the concept of mobile computing has not yet sufficiently worked its way into our application development and Internet infrastructure psyche. Instead of having to purchase synchronization software to make the concept of mobile computing a reality, the technology needed to support mobile computing should be built directly into the applications we use and the services provided by ISPs.

Unfortunately, we’re a good two years away from seeing this approach become a reality, so in the meantime we can expect to see continued proliferation of mobile computing products that just add to the problem.

Alas, trying to put a lid on this phenomenon is roughly akin to the effort back in the 1980s of trying to stop the infiltration of PCs into corporate environments. The reality is that you can’t stop people when it comes to acquiring the latest gadget in an economy where people have far too much disposable income. And if you don’t try to support it, end-users will once again view the IT department as a behind-the-times bottleneck that prevents them from attaining data nirvana alongside their latest stock quotes.

So the best thing you can do for the moment is make a short-term investment in synchronization software because you will have some modicum of control. Nevertheless, IT organizations should also be putting a tremendous amount of pressure on ISVs and ISPs to create truly seamless mobile computing infrastructures.

After all, it’s in their interest to do so. Once we have such platforms, everybody can participate. Until then, mobile computing will just remain a troublesome niche application for those who can afford to pay for it.

The only question that remains is, how long are we going to have to live with mobile solutions that only take us part of the way there?

yorkshire pudding.. breakfast and dinner version..

i am a huge huge cheer's fan.. it's one of my all time favorite shows.. and one my favorite characters was cliff clavin, the under appreciated, hapless loser mail carrier.. one episode cliff explains yorkshire pudding to the cheer's gang here. and i have always remembered his "explanation" now i have since learned it was bogus but that was part of cliff's charm he made crap up and lead you to believe it was fact.. kind of like when i tell shell or jake "well you know i read on the internet... blah blah" and shell calls me out every time.. she says "MOM YOU CAN NOT QUOTE PEREZ HILTON as a legitimate source of facts.. {head hanging in shame} i can't help it.. he wouldn't put anything on his web site that wasn't true right?? right?? helloooooo **tapping on computer screen** right?? well enough with my gullibility.. when i was a kid, well 9th grade, i stayed my friend kathy's house all the time and we made this for breakfast every time!! we would sit with our warm "oven pancake" and smear jam on it and watch american bandstand.. {ok i don't know if we watched american bandstand we probably watched smurfs but hey i have an image to uphold here..} any way when my mom and i would go to lawry's prime rib house {i've mentioned before my fondness for that place} they always served with their prime rib a yorkshire pudding.. theirs were individual so they were more like a pop over, now i could have, i repeat, could have made individual ones, you see my mother in law gave me a pop over pan once.. {very nice of her huh} and well it was big and bulky and so i moved out to my cabinet in the garage.. if you've been reading this blog for any amount of time you have heard me tell my tales of woe about putting things in the garage.. pete donates them!! right out of my cabinet.. {he doesn't anymore because i threatened to clean out the garage one day and donate his crap..} so you guessed it.. he donated my pop over pan.. *sigh* so i had to make one big one.. nevertheless it was yummy and decadent and delicious.

preheat your oven to 425 degrees {f}... ladle your pan drippings from your roast into a large iron skillet {or put your butter in a large iron skillet} now add your "drippings/butter" to the oven to get hot ..just a few minutes.. meanwhile make your batter.. sift your flour and salt together.. add your eggs and milk and whisk until thoroughly combined.. add your pepper {don't add pepper if making for breakfast} and quickly incorporate.. remove drippings/butter from oven and pour batter right until the hot drippings/butter.. put in oven and cook for 12-15 minutes until puffy and lightly brown.. remove from oven and serve hot.. when serving for dinner i like to put my meat right on top of it.. when serving for breakfast i like to serve it with raspberry jam.. yummy!!!

kaotic kitchen

my little space on the net for recipes and thoughts... i should start off by saying I am not a blogger, this is, shall we say, a journal of sorts for my recipes and random thoughts now and again, to be shared with family and friends. my cooking philosophy is simple, if the recipe has too many ingredients I won't cook it, too many pots and pans required I won't do it, sandwiches DO NOT constitute dinner. I cook simple, quick and easy meals.

about me

I have had a love for cooking since I was young.. well ok at first it wasn't a love it was my "chore." but love came later.. When I turned 16 my Mother started me reading recipes on Sunday and then picking 2 or 3 from her cook books or magazines and then preparing a grocery list from the recipe (which today I am lost if I don't have my detailed list for my trip to the store) from my list I would then clip coupons and I would head off to the grocery store.. As an incintive (I always need incintives and money works wonders *smile*) I was allowed to keep any money I saved from the coupons and she would then pay me per meal I made. I had to cook at leaast 2 a week but if wanted more money I would cook more, the prices ranged from $5.00 for simple meals such as tacos and refried beans (no canned in my house) or $15.00 for something like Chicken Cacciatore (because it takes so much longer but is so much worth it). So when I got married and got a house of my own I was able to conquer the grocery store and cooking delicious meals. um thanks Mom?

What’s The Forecast On Kepler-7B? Hot And Cloudy

by

October 01, 201311:02 AM

Scientists are reasonably sure that it’s a cloudy day on , a planet that orbits its star about 1,000 light-years away from us.

Using NASA’s orbiting space telescopes, researchers publishing in say that for the first time they’ve been able to make a rudimentary map of the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet.

The team used faint visible light and infrared reflections from Kepler-7b to make their cloud map.

“By observing this planet with Spitzer and Kepler [telescopes] for more than three years, we were able to produce a very low-resolution ‘map’ of this giant, gaseous planet,” study co-author Brice-Olivier Demory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge said in a statement.

Governments love to blame international forces beyond their control for economic ills at home. Gordon Brown was a dab hand at this. But when a boom which involved a tripling of debt and house prices ends in a bust should we really be surprised? And could the governments of Spain and the UK not have stepped in to end the excesses long before their economies got addicted to debt? I think so and let us hope they don't let booms get carried away again although looking at both countries the next boom seems an awfully long way off.

The Indians have placed righty Corey Kluber on the 10-day DL with lower back discomfort, per a team announcement. He’ll be replaced for the time being by righty Joe Colon.

Kluber has reportedly been dealing with the back issue throughout the early portion of the season, so it seems the hope is that some rest will help him move past it. He has struggled somewhat thus far, perhaps due in part to the nagging discomfort.

Though Kluber is still carrying a strong 9.9 K/9 on the year, he has allowed more walks (3.1 BB/9) than usual and has coughed up seven long balls through 37 1/3 innings. His velocity has dropped a bit, with his four-seamer sitting at 91.5 mph and his sinker averaging 92.1 mph.

Literacy Notes
The 2013 Literacy Directors’ Retreat
Literacy directors from throughout
the state met to exchange ideas at
Oklahoma’s annual literacy directors’
retreat. For the second year in a row,
the retreat theme was inspired by an
old I Love Lucy television episode
featuring Lucy and Ethel working
in a chocolate factory. A morning
brainstorming session had directors
comparing new tutors to Lucy and
Ethel’s chocolate wrapping experi-ence.
What was the consensus? Unlike
Lucy and Ethel’s humorous work
practices, volunteer tutors are suc-cessful
when they receive adequate
training, on-going supervision, and
regular feedback. Interspersed be-tween
fun activities, program direc-tors
also discussed fund raising, adult
learner book clubs, health literacy,
and techniques to deal with stress.
The retreat was made possible thanks
to Library Services and Technology
Act funds from the Institute of Mu-seum
and Library Services.
[Left to right] Ida Fay Winters describes the health literacy project in Altus. • Rebecca Barker shares ideas on using high interest
reading materials. • Jana Smithey (Elk City) and other literacy directors try to balance a hula hoop during team building exercise.

Q:

What is the actual role of ZooKeeper in Kafka 2.1?

I have seen some similar questions as follows:
www.quora.com/What-is-the-actual-role-of-Zookeeper-in-Kafka-What-benefits-will-I-miss-out-on-if-I-don%E2%80%99t-use-Zookeeper-and-Kafka-together
Is Zookeeper a must for Kafka?
But I want to know the latest information about this question.
What is the actual role of ZooKeeper in Kafka 2.1?

A:

Zookeeper is required to run a Kafka Cluster.
It is used by Kafka brokers to perform elections (controller and topic leaders), to store topic metadata and various other things (ACLs, dynamic broker configs, quotas, Producer Ids)
Since Kafka 0.9, clients don't require access to Zookeeper, only brokers rely on it.

We need to keep America the world's greatest magnet for immigrants. Why? Today, more and more people around the globe have access to the same technological tools for innovation and entrepreneurship. In such a world, the countries that make it easy to draw in human talent will have a distinct advantage. Also, a steady flow of immigrants keeps a society flexible and competitive. The more open your society is to new people and ideas, the more things will be done by you, not to you. We shouldn't just welcome educated immigrants, but laborers as well. Immigrants keep energy flowing in America's veins. But because I strongly favor immigration, I also favor a high fenceif not a physical one, then at least a tamper-proof national I.D. card for every American, without which you could not get a legal job or access to government services. We will not sustain a majority in favor of flexible immigration if we can't control our borders. Good fences make good immigration policy.. Thomas L. Friedman [4/5/06]

Tin Top Bridge. Tin-Top Bridge. Hyde Hall, East Springfield, New York. This bridge was completed in 2011 and provides access to Hyde Hall from Tin Top through its Mill Road entrance. The existing culvert, which replaced the original bridge in the early 20th century, washed out in June 2006.

Pfizer announced that the final analysis results show its COVI-19 vaccine is 95% effective in preventing infections, even to elderly, and caused no serious side effects, the company said Wednesday.. The company is preparing to formally ask U.S. Food and Drug Administration to allow emergency use of the vaccine. The announcement came after as coronavirus cases in the US skyrocketed and other parts of the world, giving hopes for an end to the pandemic.. .. Earlier this week, competitor Moderna Inc. also announced 94.5% effectiveness of its own COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which is made with the same, brand-new technology — using a snippet of the genetic code of the coronavirus to train the body to recognize if the real virus comes along.

Sir,. Condoleeza Rice's statement on claims that the US has transported prisoners to be tortured in foreign states and in secret prison camps is the height of sophistry.. It sickens me that the US administration, which claims to lead the world in human rights, is quibbling over legalisms with far greater consequence than President Clinton's manoeuvres over oral sex with Monica Lewinsky.. Ms Rice claims that near-drowning of terrorist suspects, or the causing of pain near but not equivalent to organ failure, is not torture.. If our Prime Minister is to prevent any further damage to the UK's global reputation and safety against future terrorist attacks, he must utterly repudiate such claims.. Dr Ian Brown. London WC1

Monika Kořínková and Barbora Šimková debuted their first collaboration together with the 'Pierot Porcelain Tableware Collection.' The home accessory range evokes a sense of minimalism and tradition and consists of cups, saucers, bowls and vases.. In creating the set, the duo wanted to "bring back a certain culture of dining." The elegant tableware is meant to help people take a break from their busy lives through dining experiences. Also, a tradition of tableware aesthetics has also been diminishing, with less people investing in finer porcelain dishes.. The Pierot collection features a soft color palette with light gold accents. Some of the pieces were achieved through the act of recycling old shapes of tableware -- inspired by porcelain decor and vintage cut glass.. Eccentric Porcelain Dishware. Score.

Don?. Hi, I think it is very refreshing that you have decided to keep some of your precious life private. I myself am in the process of writing lifestyle blogs and launching a new babywear product and as a naturally private person was also contemplating how much of my life I would need to disclose in order to be a successful blogger. I know that part of blogging means opening up and sharing parts of your life with the world so that they can relate with you, however I also believe there needs to be a balance between being able to capture and experience personal moments that only you and your family share with moments that will inspire or positively influence someone else out there in the wide world! Good luck with your new parenting life and business ventures. 😊

"Let’s be honest here – we love to snack as much as anyone. Why else would we start our own snack company? One bite will have you saying MMM-MMM. And when you discover they are also heart-healthy, you might say HMMMMM? Good for you AND tasty? How did they do that?

For starters, all of our chips are made with plant sterols and have been proven to lower cholesterol. We use only heart-healthy oils, plus other great ingredients like whole oats and whole grains (our tortilla chips) and a frying process that helps our potato chips have 40% less fat than regular potato chips.

Now doing something good for your heart is as easy as opening a bag of Corazonas heart-healthy chips!"

Equestrian lessons. Dressage is the execution, by a trained horse, of precision movements in response to barely perceptible signals from its rider. Dressage harmoniously develops the physique and ability of both the horse and rider.. Cleland’s equestrian lessons are for riders from beginner to advanced level who are aspiring to ride competitively and become world-class dressage or show-jumping equestrians. These lessons are intensive and are aimed towards riders who have already undertaken or would like to begin equestrianism as an athletic sport.. Our equestrian lessons are coached by FEI Level 2 Coach and FEI World Dressage Final Silver and Bronze Medalist Akoele Roachford. Akoele was trained in both dressage and showjumping in Germany. She has trained many students to a level where they were able to acquire full and partial equestrian scholarships to universities in the USA.. All Equestrian lessons are private lessons, lasting between 45 minutes to 1 hour, and will be scheduled to your convenience.

Democracy and Economic Growth. Date2012-05-23. Author. Uslu, Hakan. Type of Degreethesis. DepartmentEconomics. MetadataShow full item record. Abstract. A common theorem of political economists is that democracy and income are strongly correlated. There are conflicting views on the direction of the causality. Coups that started due to non- economic reasons are shocks to democracy. I use such coups to test the hypothesis that democracy causes high economic development. My results suggest that anti-democratic coups have a significant negative effect on economic development. On the other hand, democracy has a strong positive effect on economic development. This study focuses on how an anti-democratic change in regime influences the income level in a country.. Files. - Name:. - thesis_final_21May2012.pdf. - Size:. - 480.4Kb

About Scott Walker. Scott Walker is the 45th and current Governor of Wisconsin. He also served in the Wisconsin State Assembly and as the Milwaukee County Executive. He was recently elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association. First elected governor in the 2010 Wisconsin general election and was reelected governor in the 2014 Wisconsin gubernatorial election. The response to Walker’s policies included protests at the Wisconsin State Capitol and an effort to recall Walker. Walker introduced a budget plan which limited the collective bargaining of most Wisconsin public employees. Walker survived the 2012 recall election, becoming the first American governor to survive a recall effort. Walker was a candidate for his party’s nomination to the 2016 presidential election but left early in the contest..

If it matters, as a customer /user, I'd rather forego all my data on their

than have Garmin pay the ransom.

According to this TC article, it's basically illegal for a company to pay the
ransom:

The village is served by Poppleton railway station on the Harrogate Line. According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 1,961, increasing to 1,997 at the 2011 Census.  Before 1996, it was part of the Borough of Harrogate.

The name is derived from popel (pebble) and tun (hamlet, farm) and means "Pebble Farm" because of the gravel bed upon which the village was built. Upper Poppleton has been referred to as "Land Poppleton" and the neighbouring village of Nether Poppleton as "Water Poppleton" indicating their position relative to the river.

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles. It became a Conservation Area in 1993.

History
In 972, the village was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles as "Popeltun" and in the Domesday Book as "Popeltune". The villages and lands were given by Osbert De Arches to the Abbot of St Mary's in York. It was, therefore, under the ecclesiastical rule of the Parish of St Mary-Bishophill Junior.

During the reign of Richard II the village was the scene of the murder of a Mayor of York.

In 1644 the 25,000 strong Scottish and Parliament Armies, led by the Earl of Manchester, laid siege to the city of York. To facilitate communications, they built a "Bridge of Boats" at Poppleton. This bridge was eventually taken by Prince Rupert and his Royalist Forces, but he subsequently lost the battle at Marston Moor.

The village benefitted from the growth in the railways in the 19th century, when the York, Knaresborough and Harrogate Railway routed their line through Poppleton and erected a station.

Governance
Upper Poppleton lies within the Rural West Ward of the City of York Unitary Authority. As of the 2011 elections it is represented by Councillors Ian Gillies, Paul Healey and Chris Steward who are all members of the local Conservative Party. It is also a part of the UK Parliamentary Constituency of York Outer as well as the EU region of Yorkshire and the Humber.

Locally there is a Parish Council with eight council members.

Economy
The Poppletons were formerly agricultural settlements with many farms, but the modern village is mostly a dormitory for commuters to the nearby towns and cities. It has benefited from its good road and rail links. The village has local retail facilities, including a Post Office, and some small enterprises.

Demography
In the 19th century the population has varied between 284 and 346. The census of 2001 recorded the population as 1,961.

Community
There are two allotment sites in the village of Upper Poppleton. One is located at the end of Beech Grove and the other is in Main Street next to the Library. There are eight allotments on the Beech Grove Allotments, each approximately 300 square metres. The land is owned by the Parish Council. Main Street Allotments have seven plots.

There is a Youth Club and Scout Troop in the village.

Education
In 1797, local ironmonger John Dodsworth founded a Church of England School. This was converted into accommodation for the School Master when a new building was built in 1850. As of 2010 Poppleton Ousebank Primary provides primary education for both Poppletons.

For secondary education, the village is in the catchment area of York High School on Cornlands Road in nearby Acomb, though the nearest secondary school is Manor CE on Millfield Lane. Manor is a Church of England School and has its own admissions policy separate from the local City Council. It was originally built in 1813 at Kings Manor and has moved several times before being sited in Millfield Lane.

Transport

Harrogate Coach Travel buses run past the village as part of the York to Ripon route.

First York buses operate in the village as part of the Nether Poppleton route to York/Stamford Bridge. Transdev York buses operate in the village, as part of the Nether Poppleton route to York/Stamford Bridge, As well as through the village, as part of the Askham Bar/Acomb to Clifton Moor/Monks Cross/University route. Eddie Brown buses run past the village as part of the York to Boroughbridge/Ripon route.

A Park and Ride (Poppleton Bar) was constructed by the A59 in 2015, with Park and Ride buses (route 59) running from Poppleton to York centre, generally every ten minutes.

Northern Rail operates a stopping service on the line between York and Leeds via Harrogate. Poppleton station is the first station after York.

Religion

The old Norman 'Chapel of All Hallows' in Upper Poppleton was demolished in 1890 to make way for the Victorian Church of All Saints. The 'new' church was designed by Hodgson Fowler of Durham.

In 1866, the two Poppleton Parishes were united to form the Parish of Nether Poppleton with Upper Poppleton. All Saints' Church is situated on The Green in Upper Poppleton.

The present Methodist Chapel on the Green replaced two previous buildings on the site built in 1817 and 1819 respectively.

Sports
Poppleton United 1st XI play in York Football League Premier Division, as of 2010, and play next to the Community Centre on Main Street. The 2nd XI play in Reserve Division C. Poppleton Tigers Junior Football Club is located in Nether Poppleton, but serves both villages.

There is a Lawn Tennis Club with artificial and all weather courts in Main Street. As of 2010 the Men's 1st and second team play in Division One of the Tyke Petroleum Tennis League and the 3rd team play in Division Six. The Ladies 1st team also compete in the Ladies section of the same League, with the 1st team playing in Division One, the 2nd team in Division Three and the 3rd team in Division Three as of 2010. They also enter five teams in the Mixed Section in Divisions One, Two, Six Eight and Eleven.

Orienteering in Tilgate Forest. Published on 05/02/20. Despite the squelchy and swamp-like conditions at the regional orienteering event in Tilgate Forest, the two members of the Claremont Fan Court School orienteering squad made the journey to Crawley and completed their courses in impressive fashion.. On the 2.7 km orange course, Thomas F navigated steadily, with no significant errors, and was very pleased to finish in 49:53 for 8th place. Ellis B, on his first outing this year, sped round the 2 km yellow course to finish in first place in the excellent time of 21:35. After his best result so far, Ellis is looking forward to moving up to the orange course at Ashdown Forest.

State leaders continue to rail against federal tax plan

The tax overhaul plan proposed by President Donald Trump and now being considered in Congress would end the deduction on federal income tax forms for state and local property taxes. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said it would disproportionately harm New Yorkers, where property taxes are among the highest in the nation, and he’s taken opportunities at recent public events to make the case against the plan.

WBFO Albany Correspondent Karen DeWitt reports.

Cuomo called the plan unfair “double taxation.” If New Yorkers are not allowed to deduct their state and local taxes, they essentially would be taxed twice – once by state and local governments and again by the federal government on earnings that they already paid in the form of taxes to the state and local governments. He estimated it would cost New York $17.5 billion a year.

“This is like upside-down world,” Cuomo said on Oct. 5 on Long Island. “It’s called a tax cut plan. It’s really a tax increase for most New Yorkers.”

Cuomo predicted that getting rid of the deduction also would ruin the state’s business climate, which is already struggling in some regions.

“It is an attempt by the federal government, purposeful or coincidental, to make New York and several states actually less competitive for businesses,” Cuomo said on Oct. 3 in New York City.

The governor is not alone in his opposition. Fellow Democrats, including State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, also are worried. DiNapoli said recently that he’s “very concerned” about the effects of eliminating the deduction.

“For a high-tax state like New York, state and local tax deductibility has been a very important component of the federal tax code,” said DiNapoli, who added that even with a proposed higher standard deduction, it’s still not a “win” for New York taxpayers.

DiNapoli and Cuomo have conducted separate studies showing that New Yorkers give over $40 billion more in taxes to the federal government than the state gets back, an imbalance that has doubled in recent years.

U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is New York’s senior senator and the Senate minority leader, said it’s not just New Yorkers who will be adversely affected. Schumer said one-third of total taxpayers in the United States, or about 44 million, currently take the state and local tax deductions. He recently released data showing that people in states like Georgia, a Republican stronghold, and Colorado also would be affected.

“The effect of removing state and local deductibility is deep and wide,” Schumer said. “And I think it’s going to alone kill the Republican plan as it is.”

Schumer predicted that the elimination of the deduction eventually will be dropped from the plan. He said he was involved in the last successful tax overhaul in the 1980s. He said the deduction was ultimately kept in the plan because it would have adversely affected too many lawmakers’ constituents.

Several Republican congressmen and women in New York already have said they are against getting rid of the state and local property tax deductions, including John Faso of the Hudson Valley and Peter King of Staten Island. Seven GOP members, including Claudia Tenney and John Katko, both of central New York, and Elise Stefanik of the North Country, wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, asking him to reconsider.

Cuomo said if the final plan includes the elimination of the deduction, he’ll go to court to stop it.

True molecular solutions of natural cellulose in the binary ionic liquid-containing solvent mixtures.
Evidence is presented for the first time of true molecular dissolution of cellulose in binary mixtures of common polar organic solvents with ionic liquid. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, small-angle neutron-, X-ray- and static light scattering were used to investigate the structure of cellulose solutions in mixture of dimethyl formamide and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. Structural information on the dissolved chains (average molecular weight ∼ 5 × 10(4)g/mol; gyration radius ∼ 36 nm, persistence length ∼ 4.5 nm), indicate the absence of significant aggregation of the dissolved chains and the calculated value of the second virial coefficient ∼ 2.45 × 10(-2)mol ml/g(2) indicates that this solvent system is a good solvent for cellulose. More facile dissolution of cellulose could be achieved in solvent mixtures that exhibit the highest electrical conductivity. Highly concentrated cellulose solution in pure ionic liquid (27 wt.%) prepared according to novel method, utilizing the rapid evaporation of a volatile co-solvent in binary solvent mixtures at superheated conditions, shows insignificant cellulose molecular aggregation.

Employers cannot force employees to retire at 65 without a clear justification in each case after a ruling by the UK’s Supreme Court yesterday.. Five justices ruled that Leslie Seldon, a partner in a Kent firm, had not been treated unfairly when compulsorily retired at 65. But they sent his case back to the employment tribunal to consider whether the mandatory age of 65, in the circumstances of the law firm, was a “proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aims of the partnership”.. The ruling sets out new guidance for firms and companies, making clear they can force employees to

Q:

Is there a tool for windows that creates formula-pictures out of a text-formula

I am looking for a tool that would batch process text-files containing formulas (possibly latex style) and convert them into a gif/png/jpg. Since I want to do a batch conversion, the tool ideally runs in cmd.exe.
What I need is probably possible with a latex installation (MiKTeX comes to mind), but if not absolutely necessary, I don't want to install 100MB+ for my need.
Is there such a tool?

A:

The "best" solution for quality is to use a full LaTeX installation, and then generate images via command line with e.g. mathTeX.
From my answer to a similar (but not duplicate, imho) question here at Super User:

MathTeX, licensed under the gpl, is a cgi program that lets you easily embed LaTeX math in your own html pages, blogs, wikis, etc. It parses a LaTeX math expression and immediately emits the corresponding gif (or png) image, rather than the usual TeX dvi. So just place an html  tag in your document wherever you want to see the corresponding LaTeX expression.

It can either be used as a CGI script on the server and linked directly from the <img> tag, or run on the command-line to generate standalone image files. From the homepage:

mathTeX is usually run by your web server as a cgi program, obtaining its input expression from the query-string of an html  tag. But you can also run mathTeX from your Unix shell, supplying all input on the command line. For example, ./mathtex.cgi "x^2+y^2" –o equation1   renders an image of x^2+y^2 in file equation1.gif.

There is actually a related project called mimeTeX that sounds more or less exactly like what you want, even though the quality is said to not be as good as with a full LaTeX installation solution as mathTeX uses, and it can naturally not handle all LaTeX cases without a LaTeX installation.
Like mathTeX, it is made primarily with webservers in mind, but in the same way, it can be run from the command line. You don't specify OS, which often indicates Windows, and compilation instructions for Windows are available on the project page linked earlier.

EDIT: I noted that the mimeTeX page provides pre-compiled binaries for Windows as well, under §5.1. Just download that and follow the instructions, as any regular Windows program. If you are on e.g. Debian or Ubuntu, both mimeTeX and mathTeX are part of the main repository.

What's the best way to laying out a brochure (trifold) 8.5" x 11" using InDesign?. Where is your problem? Why not start to work?. A trifold needs to have the fold-in panel slightly smaller in width than the other 2 panels. The paper thickness determines the appropriate panel size, but for general purposes, 1/16 inch smaller for the fold-in should suffix.. For referencing the pages of a trifold, use this numbering scheme: front 5-6-1 and back 2-3-4.. You can lay this out with two 11 x 8.5 pages OR 6 single pages arranged in a group of 1-2-3 and 4-5-6. Using the 6 single page method requires a version of Indesign that allows modifying page sizes. NOTE: you can set up 3 equal size panels, but this can create a folding issue.. To achieve the 1/16 inch smaller panel, create guides/pages with the following widths: [front 3.625 - 3.6875 - 3.6875] and [back 3.6875 - 3.6875 - 3.625]

.. As a result of Mkhitaryan’s aforementioned demands, Thomas Tuchel’s side would have to sell him this summer itself in order to avoid losing him for free next year. And because of that, Arsenal now have the chance of signing the player for a bargain price of just £20m!. Mkhitaryan, who is widely regarded as one of the most technically gifted players of his position, in Europe, was in scintillating form for his club last season during the course of which he scored 23 goals and provided 32 assists in 52 appearances. He may prove to be a massively useful signing for the Gunners, going by his capability to play as a winger and an attacking midfielder and the amount of big stage experience that he possesses, and may complement the likes of Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez pretty well.

Zinc(II) complexes of the second-generation quinolone antibacterial drug enrofloxacin: Structure and DNA or albumin interaction.
Zinc mononuclear complexes with the second-generation quinolone antibacterial drug enrofloxacin in the absence or presence of a nitrogen donor heterocyclic ligand 1,10-phenanthroline or 2,2'-bipyridine have been synthesized and characterized. Enrofloxacin is on deprotonated mode acting as a bidentate ligand coordinated to zinc ion through the ketone and a carboxylato oxygen atoms. The crystal structure of bis(enrofloxacinato)(1,10-phenanthroline)zinc(II), 2, has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The biological activity of the complexes has been evaluated by examining their ability to bind to calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) with UV and fluorescence spectroscopies. UV studies of the interaction of the complexes with DNA have shown that they can bind to CT DNA and the DNA binding constants have been calculated. Competitive studies with ethidium bromide (EB) have shown that the complexes exhibit the ability to displace the DNA-bound EB indicating that they bind to DNA in strong competition with EB for the intercalative binding site. The complexes exhibit good binding propensity to human and bovine serum albumin proteins having relatively high binding constant values.

Rapid response to budesonide (Pulmicort) inhaled via the Nebuhaler in asthmatic children.
Acute reversible airways obstruction in children, especially those aged under one year, who may respond poorly to inhaled beta 2-stimulants, is difficult to treat in general practice. In an open study, 48 episodes in 29 children, half aged under one year, were treated with budesonide (Pulmicort) 0.1-2.09 mg used to charge a Nebuhaler fitted with a facemask. In 45 instances, clinical improvement was observed, and with doses of 0.8 mg and above, this usually occurred within 10 minutes. This study suggests that budesonide via a suitable delivery system can evoke rapid improvement in reversible airways obstruction in young children.

Q:

How to Extract people's last name start with "S" and first name not start with "S"

As the title shows, how do I capture a person who:

Last name start with letter "S"
First name NOT start with letter "S"

The expression should match the entire last name, not just the first letter, and first name should NOT be matched.
Input string is like the following:

(Last name) (First name)
Duncan, Jean
Schmidt, Paul
Sells, Simon
Martin, Jane
Smith, Peter
Stephens, Sheila

This is my regular expression:
/([S].+)(?:, [^S])/

Here is the result I have got:

Schmidt, P
Smith, P

the result included "," space & letter "P" which should be excluded.
The ideal match would be

Schmidt
Smith

A:

You can try this pattern: ^S\w+(?=, [A-RT-Z]).
^S\w+ matches any word (name in your case) that start with S at the beginning,
(?=, [A-RT-Z]) - positive lookahead - makes sure that what follows, is not the word (first name in your case) starting with S ([A-RT-Z] includes all caps except S).

The primary field of application for this invention is guidance of unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles. In such applications it is common practice to compute a guidance command that results in a rate of turn that depends on a measurement of heading error. Both the measurement and the command are with respect to an inertial coordinate frame of reference. The guidance command is received and acted upon by a system (commonly referred to as an autopilot or stability augmentation system), which in turn sends commands to the vehicles servos and/or reaction control devices. This results in a movement of the vehicle's control surfaces, or vectors the thrust produced by the vehicle's propulsion system, or turns on-and-off a reaction control system, or a combination of such means of vehicle control. However vehicles respond to servo command relative to the medium through which they move, and when that medium is also in motion, then the rate of turn that is achieved depends nonlinearly on the speed and direction of the medium through which the vehicle is moving. This dependence can result in degraded or even unstable responses to the guidance system command, particularly for vehicles whose speed relative to the medium is not far greater than the speed of the medium itself (e.g. guided parafoils and underwater vehicles).
One approach to this problem is to sense the vector motion of the vehicle relative to the medium through which it is moving as well as its inertial velocity vector. By differencing these two quantities, one can compute the inertial velocity of the medium and provide a correction to the guidance command for that motion. However this requires incorporating devices that sense the vehicle's vector relative motion, which are not normally a part of the existing guidance and control system design. Such sensors in an aircraft are often referred to as an air data system.

Deep brain stimulation of globus pallidus internus in a 16-year-old boy with severe tourette syndrome and mental retardation.
A 16- year-old boy with long-standing severe Tourette syndrome (TS) and mental retardation, non-responsive to complex pharmocological and behavioural treatment was selected for bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Pre-operative and post-operative Yale Tourette syndrome scale (YTSS) scores and several other scores were used to quantify the effect of DBS up to one year follow-up. Although subscores of the YTSS improved, the overall outcome of chronic GPi-DBS showed no substantial therapeutic effect. This finding is in contrast to markedly improved TS of the only two adolescent TS patients in whom DBS has been performed so far. In this article we discuss possible reasons for the poor therapeutic effect of GPi-DBS in our patient contributing to the on-going debate on DBS inclusion criteria for adolescent TS patients.

For a long time, simply proving the existence of exoplanets was a big deal. We had over a hundred years of fiction and even non-fiction based on the assumption that our universe is absolutely packed with alien planets — but we simply couldn’t prove that they existed. Now, with the list of planets outside our solar system ballooning by dozens or more at a time, the stakes are quite a bit higher. Simply finding and identifying exoplanets is no longer enough to impress, and now you have to actually learn something about them. That’s been the goal of a team from MIT, which this week publishes a piece detailing their pioneering new method for looking at alien weather.

That’s much easier said than done, however, for many of the same reasons that it took so long to confirm the existence of exoplanets in the first place: they are very small and very dark. Most exoplanets have been confirmed thanks to so-called “transit” in front of their parent star, producing a blown-own planetary silhouette. Astronomers have worked to pull much more useful data from these transits than simple size and speed, and this MIT paper represents a major step toward that goal. By looking at the fluctuations in any light spilling around the edges of an alien world, these researchers can gain some insight into its atmosphere. Particularly, the team can derive some real information about the clouds that sit on top of this atmosphere.

The technique starts with a climate model that uses predicted pressure values to predict how different substances will behave on the surface of a given planet. This gives the team a mixture of gaseous products to model, and the software then looks at how these gasses might interact on the surface of an alien world with particular properties. The software spits out a prediction for the spectrographic readings we’d expect to be associated with each of these possible cloud formations. After that, all they need to do is compare their actual readings to the list of predictions — if any of the values fits observation too well to be coincidence, that’s probably our culprit.

The team used Kepler 7b as a test bed for its technique, and their readings suggest that the planet has clouds made of vaporized rock. On Earth these substances would be solid, or at most liquid near the planet’s interior. However Kepler 7b is absolutely gargantuan (one reason it was one of the first five confirmed exoplanets) and orbits less than a twentieth of as far from its star as the Earth does from Sol; sometimes referred to as a “hot Jupiter,” Kepler is a nightmarish furnace to make Venus look hospitable.

NASA’s TESS mission could make even these findings look tame.

These incredible rock-clouds are just another bullet point on the list of reasons exoplanetologists have the coolest scientific conferences. Their results often read like the ramblings of a science fiction author, narrating a magellan-like voyage through a universe far too surreal to ever actually exist. Worlds have been shown to rain diamond, or simply to be composed almost entirely of it. Others have multiple sunsets or abnormally long or short years. Astronomers have found planets that are several times older than our Sun, and others that are younger than our upright ancestors. The search for alien planets is the search for the edges of what’s possible, and techniques like this one are proving that we are very far from finding them.

While Kepler was mankind’s first tailored planet hunter, NASA is already well underway on its successor: the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. TESS should take our understanding of exoplanets to a new level, and unlike many areas of astronomy, in this case the tinier the detail of the observation the more relatable it is to the average person. It’s hard to imagine a super-Jupiter, but easier to imagine clouds. Exoplanetology will almost certainly be one of the most publicly lauded areas of astronomy in years to come.

Guanethidine-induced adrenergic sympathectomy augments endoneurial perfusion and lowers endoneurial microvascular resistance.
Chronic administration of guanethidine sulfate in the rat induces a selective adrenergic neuropathy. We studied the effects of guanethidine-induced adrenergic sympathectomy on rat sciatic nerve blood flow (NBF), microvascular resistance (MR), vessel caliber and norepinephrine (NE) content. A control group of animals was studied following chronic administration of mammalian Ringer's solution. NBF and MR were measured with an endoneurial microelectrode, using the technique of hydrogen clearance (HC). Following HC, the sciatic nerve was perfused with India Ink, removed, frozen and sectioned. Measurements were made of endoneurial microvessel numbers, diameter, circumference and area. The contralateral sciatic nerve was removed for measurements of NE content. In guanethidine-treated animals we observed elevated NBF, reduced MR and dilated microvessels. Numbers of microvessels and fascicular areas were similar to controls. NE content was markedly reduced following sympathectomy. These studies suggest that NBF, unlike cerebral blood flow (CBF), is regulated by its adrenergic input. Removal of adrenergic innervation of the vasa nervorum appears to result in a loss of tonic vasoconstrictive action.

Lapis Lazuli Mens Rings. Add-ons have become favored by both men and women, the factors why they choose all of them are very different. Ladies would you like to look great as well as want their outfits becoming completed because of the jewellery they wear. Using this into consideration, a woman will usually use the proper earrings, necklaces or bracelets in line with the garments she has opted for.. Men conversely don’t have equivalent factors because the ladies. They could in addition look at the advantages they will have so far as the appearance are worried, however they are additionally into showing their energy and status. Regardless of what they might be using or even for exactly what occasion, males whom like using jewellery will do therefore simply because they would also like to deliver an email.

Along with the cost of transportation, it is of extreme importance to take into account the factors like risk while driving, the wear and tear of the road, bad weather condition and many more. All these factors have a direct impact on the safety of your car. So make sure that you have hired experienced and licensed transportation service like provided by auto shipping Danbury team. Going forward with such team can give you enormous benefits and can end up with the worth hiring service.

I'm using a knoppix live cd (recommended by uni) to compile and run c programs off a usb drive - practice makes perfect. I get compile error messages when not done properly, warning messages, etc which is good. But when I try to run the program nothing happens. So for example, to compile test.c (which displays a simple printf statement), I would type:. $ gcc -o test test.c. Then to run the program, I type:. $ test. And nothing happens. It just goes to the next line, ready to take in another command. Why?

Development Strategy and Feasibility Study of Income Generation Projects in Machakhela National Parks. Commissioned by UNDP, the Goal of the project was to identify potential income generation projects for Machakhela National Park and prepare technical and economic feasibility analysis regarding the selected projects, evaluate the risks associated with the implementation of the projects in terms of their impact on environment and biodiversity and provide relevant risk mitigation strategy. Except that, the impact assessment of new road to Chakvistavi village on Mtirala National Park was included as the part of the project. The main purpose of the impact assessment was to identify actions to maximize benefits for the NP and mitigate potential negative impacts caused by increased number of visitors due to improved access.

Regardless of the amount by which personal lending increases, what is important is the availability of help for those who get themselves into difficulty, and we may see an increase in the number of people in difficulty if interest rates rise towards the end of the year. I know that that would cause pain to a great many of our constituents, so it is important to get the system right now.

With a supportive FCA framework already in place, a fairly minor amendment to the Bill could effectively set a fee structure that would activate the provision of free debt management plans by authorised firms. I hope that my Front-Bench colleagues agree that action is needed soon, and that the Bill represents a timely vehicle for the necessary change.

I believe this to be a truly cross-party issue, and that the Bill needs to be amended to give people in debt more security and access to free, high-quality plans that help them to manage their finances. If interest rates do go up any time soon, the debt management sector may be called on to give even more support than it provides now, and this is therefore a good time to strengthen the system.

Establishment of a turkey cecal cell line and development of turkey coccidia within the cells.
Cells were dispersed from cecal tissues of 1- to 2-day-old turkeys using a mixture of collagenase and dispase to enrich for epithelial cells. The initial culture produced from these cells (TCC) appeared to be heterogeneous, but, as the cells were cultured through 25 passages, they assumed a more fibroblastic appearance. Cellular invasion of the TCC by two species of turkey coccidia, Eimeria adenoeides and Eimeria meleagrimitis, was not enhanced, as compared with invasion in turkey kidney cells (TKC), the cell culture system standardly used to study the avian coccidia in vitro. However, early development by one of the species, E. meleagrimitis, was markedly increased in the TCC (Passages 6 through 19) over that in TKC. Thirty to 42% of the parasites that invaded the TCC developed beyond the sporozoite stage, as compared with 5% development in TKC. Mature first-generation schizonts were observed within 24 hr postinoculation in the TCC, but not until 48 hr in the kidney cells. There was no evidence that development of the second generation was initiated in either the TCC or kidney cells.

Five years ago, Bruce R. Spector was a partner in a little Washington cable TV company when he thought he saw the future. And for all the breathless whiz-bang hype of the Information Age, it wasn't cable.. Humble as it seemed -- and as pitiful a financial shape as it was in after a series of failed or struggling leveraged buyouts -- Spector and partner Joseph L. Mathias IV decided the future was radio. Based on that insight, they launched Benchmark Communications, a Baltimore company they hope to take public later this year, one that an industry peer says could be worth up to $160 million.. Benchmark has been on an acquisition spree since Congress approved the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which let companies such as Benchmark own many more stations in the same radio markets. This month alone, it has bought six stations to bring its total to 33, all in the southeastern United States, in small cities where the company can avoid such giant players as Westinghouse Electric Corp.

When I first started diving, I experienced quite a bit of motion sickness. It would never be a problem before a dive, but it would be a real problem upon surfacing. I would feel nauseaus at the surface and on the boat, and the feeling would slowly fade once back on land.. I learned a few tricks to minimize motion sickness. Medication probably helped the most, but I also ate better and drank more water. I also chugged a special soda immediately before diving; the soda contains an acid that counters motion sickness.. Over time, I noticed that my motion sickness decreased. I would dive unprepared, which is to say I hadn’t taken the medication or drank the soda, but I would feel relatively well after the dive.. I still take all precautions before a dive, just in case. However, it seems that the body adapts and naturally becomes less susceptible to motion sickness over time.. Good tips for combating motion sickness while diving!

Health Care In The Suburbs: An Analysis Of Suburban Poverty And Health Care Access.
There are 16.9 million Americans living in poverty in the suburbs-more than in cities or rural communities. Despite recent increases in suburban poverty, the perception of the suburbs as areas of uniform affluence remains, and there has been little research into health care barriers experienced by people living in these areas. The objectives of this study were to compare patterns of insurance coverage and health care access in suburban, urban, and rural areas using national survey data from 2005 to 2015 and to compare outcomes by geography before and after the Affordable Care Act took effect. We found that nearly 40 percent of the uninsured population lived in suburban areas. Though unadjusted rates of health care access were better in suburban areas, compared to urban and rural communities, this advantage was greatly reduced after income and other demographics are accounted for. Overall, a substantial portion of the US population residing in the suburbs lacked health insurance and experienced difficulties accessing care. Increased policy attention is needed to address these challenges for vulnerable populations living in the suburbs.

Title III Ruling to Effect Real Estate Market? 3 Experts Weigh In

Friday marked a big win for entrepreneurs and the everyday consumer when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted 3-1 for the next step in equity crowd funding. The approval of Title III of the JOBS Act is a long-awaited ruling that has both experts and consumers talking about the impact it will have on our country's economy—and the real estate market.

Once the ruling goes into effect, companies can be financed by anyone with the cash to opt in, without undergoing the public registration process. This is a huge move, as it's the first time in the history of the SEC (that's 82 years!) that retail investors---otherwise known as your everyday joe--will be able to invest in private businesses.

So how will this impact the real estate market? Below, three industry experts weigh in on what the ruling will mean for our economy, and the $2.5 billion real estate crowdfunding industry.

Scott Picken, author of Property Going Global and CEO and founder of Wealth Migrate, the 10th largest global real estate crowdfunding platform.“I don’t believe there is going to be a catalytic change overnight, but this will have a catalytic affect in the long term. The bottom line is that the wealth gap, the difference between the have’s and the have not’s, is the greatest challenge we have on the planet, and it is only getting worse. Now with technology and this change in legislation, the bottom 99 percent will have the same access to the same opportunities and partners as the top 1 percent. What most people don’t understand is that this will have a big impact in America, but a far greater impact in the emerging world. This is going to change the real estate industry forever and also put a case forward to a global change in legislation.”Marshall Saunders, co-founder and managing partner of SaundersDailey, a real estate crowdfunding platform connecting investors to residential real estate opportunities in select markets throughout the Midwest.“[The ruling] is not as wide open and accepting of non-accredited investors as I had hoped for. But it's a start. We will make the best out of the rules and will consider it a toe in the door. With good results, and consumer demand, we will see that door opening wider and wider in the coming years. The bottom line is that non-accredited investors now have a way of participating in equity crowdfunding. It will change the way America invests, both in business startups and real estate. The wait has been hard, but understandable. The U.S. Congress has no idea the magnitude of what it was dumping on the SEC when it passed the JOBS Act in 2012. Given that fact, the SEC has done the best that they can to move this forward.”

“Title III was never intended to have a competitive impact on the established markets. By design it's intended to enable entrepreneurs and real estate sponsors that have had difficulty raising much-needed capital from traditional channels to be able to do so more efficiently from individual investors, which is precisely what it will facilitate and make a meaningful impact on for those that access this new ecosystem.”

Only time will tell exactly how Title III will impact real estate, but it seems as if times are changing, 3-1.

The VSG expression sites of Trypanosoma brucei: multipurpose tools for the adaptation of the parasite to mammalian hosts.
The variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes of Trypanosoma brucei are transcribed in telomeric loci termed VSG expression sites (ESs). Despite permanent initiation of transcription in most if not all of these multiple loci, RNA elongation is abortive except in bloodstream forms where full transcription up to the VSG occurs only in a single ES at a time. The ESs active in bloodstream forms are polycistronic and contain several genes in addition to the VSG, named ES-associated genes (ESAGs). So far 12 ESAGs have been identified, some of which are present only in some ESs. Most of these genes encode surface proteins and this list includes different glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins such as the heterodimeric receptor for the host transferrin (ESAG7/6), integral membrane proteins such as the receptor-like transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (ESAG4) and a surface transporter (ESAG10). An interesting exception is ESAG8, which may encode a cell cycle regulator involved in the differentiation of long slender into short stumpy bloodstream forms. Several ESAGs belong to multigene families including pseudogenes and members transcribed out of the ESs, named genes related to ESAGs (GRESAGs). However, some ESAGs (7, 6 and 8) appear to be restricted to the ESs. Most of these genes can be deleted from the active ES without apparently affecting the phenotype of bloodstream form trypanosomes, probably either due to the expression of ESAGs from 'inactive' ESs (ESAG7/6) or due to the expression of GRESAGs (in particular, GRESAGs4 and GRESAGs1). At least three ESAGs (ESAG7, ESAG6 and SRA) share the evolutionary origin of VSGs. The presence of these latter genes in ESs may confer an increased capacity of the parasite for adaptation to various mammalian hosts, as suggested in the case of ESAG7/6 and proven for SRA, which allows T. brucei to infect humans. Similarly, the existence of a collection of slightly different ESAG4s in the multiple ESs might provide the parasite with adenylyl cyclase isoforms that may regulate growth in response to different environmental conditions. The high transcription rate and high recombination level that prevail in VSG ESs may have favored the generation and/or recruitment in these sites of genes whose hyper-evolution allows adaptation to a larger variety of hosts.

These golf shoes are clearly geared towards the younger crowd and why not with a young upstart golfer in Rickie Fowler as their spokesman, Puma clearly knows the direction they're going in. So would I, a 42 year old hacker, father of 3 be able to rock these pastel head turners. Read on!

Features
Last year I had the opportunity to review some Puma Tipper Golf Shoes and was thoroughly impressed with the technology used in the shoes to make them so lightweight yet so sturdy for all kinds of golfing conditions. This Special Edition Cell Fusion model doesn't disappoint. You notice right away from holding the SE model the Smart Quill technology. This year Puma takes it to another level with replaceable SmartQuill spikes with Fast Twist 2 directional locking technology for more grip. The Smart Quills combined with the iCell technology in the forefoot and heel of the shoe makes this not only more comfortable than the Tippers I reviewed but also give you better traction to the ground during your swing.

Looks
Puma doesn't pull any punches with its SE Cell Fusion model. The retro two-tone Puma stripe in yellow and green is eye catching to say the least. When I first wore them you should of heard the comments from my fashion conscience daughters as well from some of my playing partners. With the crystal blue base these are the slickest golf shoes Puma has released. It took some getting use to, the color combination but after awhile wearing with them with a Puma shirt and pants with similar color palettes I quickly got over it. From the pictures you'll also note the contrasting piping shoelaces. Puma gives you three extra sets of shoe laces to change it up whenever you like, a nice touch.

Feel and Comfort
After a few rounds, the SE Puma Cell Fusions proved to be a great lightweight, sturdy and comfortable golf shoe. I wore them straight out of the box no break in period here. My feet never seem to get tired or fatigued even in the heat we've been getting recently in the Ottawa area. The Smart Quill spikes provided great traction for all types of golf shots whether it was on the fairway, the bunker or the rough. The Cell Fusion's waterproof full-grain leather upper managed to keep me dry in some torrential rains recently and that can't be said for all golf shoes.

Conclusion
If you want a retro stylish looking golf shoe that Rickie Fowler wears, the SE Cell Fusion fits the bill. If you're a little more conservation the Cell Fusion's also comes in Black/White/Red and White/Snorkel Blue. Don't worry if you have a hard time matching them with rest of your golf wardrobe because Puma has some great SE apparel to go along with these shoes. Stay tuned for more reviews!

After a bit of getting use to I even managed to pull off wearing these golf shoes. How can you not like golf shoes that are so lightweight and comfortable and actually help your golf game. Better traction and stability awaits you with the Cell Fusion Special Edition Golf Shoes . SE Cell Fusion shoes can be bought online at the Puma Store. Retail value $180.00 USD. Trendy Golf also sells them as well as Fairway Styles.

Dutch is the sole official language, and is the language of education, government, business, and the media.[6] Over 60% of the population speaks Dutch as a mother tongue,[43] and most of the rest of the population speaks it as a second language. In 2004 Suriname became an associate member of the Dutch Language Union.[44]).[45].[46] and Portuguese are also used.. The public discourse about Suriname’s languages is a part of an ongoing debate about the country’s national identity.[46] The use of the popular Sranan became associated with nationalist politics after its public use by former dictator Dési Bouterse in the 1980s,[46] and groups descended from escaped slaves might resent it.[46] Some propose to change the national language to English, so as to improve links to the Caribbean and North America, or to Spanish, as a nod to Suriname’s location in South America, although it has no Spanish-speaking neighbours.[46]

The Walt Disney Company is well known for supporting Children’s Hospitals in the communities where it has a presence. In Florida they’ve built a whole pavilion for the Florida Hospital for Children. In California, the support for the Children’s Hospital of Orange County is great. That tradition will continue with the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort with Disney donating $3.1 million USD to fund Disney-themed play spaces and therapeutic play activities at children’s hospitals across China.

Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger announced the gift at the Shanghai Children’s Medical Center. Over the course of the five-year program, the donation will provide more than 50 hospitals in China with play rooms and therapeutic play activities. Disney will also donate Shanghai Disneyland theme park tickets to support children and their families as they undergo and recover from treatment.

“In honor of the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, we are creating a bit of Disney magic where it is needed most. With our gift of 20million RMB and tickets to our new theme park, we hope to bring happiness and laughter to children and families in hospitals across the country by creating opportunities to play and spend quality time together,” Iger said.

The donation will be administered by the Shanghai Charity Foundation for children’s hospitals in and around Shanghai, and by the China Soong Ching Ling Foundation for hospitals in the rest of China. The play curriculum and training will be designed and implemented by Right To Play, an international non-profit organization that uses the transformative power of play to educate and empower children to overcome adversity.

“Over the past few years, the Shanghai Children’s Medical Center has built several children’s play spaces with support from The Walt Disney Company,” said Jiang Zhongyi, Director of Shanghai Children’s Medical Center. “This new fund not only showcases Disney’s social responsibility and support for children, but also helps promote innovative new therapeutic play concepts that are helping transform children’s healthcare.”

Disney’s support of children’s hospitals dates back to the 1930s when Walt Disney would visit with children, often accompanied by Disney characters and animators. Today that support includes millions of dollars in annual grants and donations that provide play spaces, theme park tickets, first-run movies, care packages, in-kind support, and hospital visits from beloved Disney characters.

Disney has already supported several children’s hospitals in Shanghai through the development of play spaces, play therapy training, and character visits. Disney VoluntEARS have made more than 150 hospital visits and benefited more than 12,000 children and their families.

The present invention relates to an endoscope and a sheath which detachably covers an inserting tube of the endoscope.
Conventionally, the inserting tube of an endoscope is covered with a detachable sheath that is exchanged and discarded after each endoscopic inspection in order to prevent infection between patients via the endoscope.
The sheath includes an elastic tubular portion for covering the inserting tube and a cylindrical supporting portion connected to the proximal end of the tubular portion so as to allow the inserting tube to be inserted into the tubular portion through the supporting portion. The supporting portion is provided with an air feeding conduit for feeding air into and thereby inflating the tubular portion, and a packing for sealing a gap around the inserting tube being passed therethrough to prevent leaking of the air fed into the tubular portion.
The tubular portion is formed to have an inner diameter smaller than the outer diameter of the inserting tube. When inserting the inserting tube into the tubular portion in order to be covered therewith, the tubular portion is inflated by feeding air into it. The air feeding is stopped after the inserting tube has been fully inserted into the sheath so that the tubular portion shrinks and adheres on the inserting tube. In this manner, the inserting tube is covered with the tubular portion of the sheath without having any portion where the tubular portion floats therefrom. The sheath is put on the inserting tube in a manner as above since a floating portion of the sheath may cause the sheath to be snagged and even torn on a body wall when the inserting tube is inserted into a human body.
The conventional sheath, however, is relatively expensive since it is provided with the packing and the conduit for air feeding. Thus, the sheath has been one of the causes of increasing the endoscopic inspection cost.

Brussels grows specimens only under carefully controlled conditions, meticulously training each tree with wire and pruning over a period of years. If upon the tree's arrival some leaves have dropped or turned slightly brown that does not mean the bonsai is unhealthy. Defoliation is the natural result of being in the low-light environment of a shipping box. When you receive your tree, place the box in a shaded area to unpack. Inspect tree for damage to branches or leaves. Water soil if dry, and place the tree in. For more information on care and training visit Brussel's Bonsai on the Web.

Arteriovenous malformations of the tongue: a spectrum of disease.
To examine our vascular anomalies team's experience with tongue arteriovenous malformations (AVM) with specific emphasis on the spectrum on disease and surgical management. Retrospective chart review of 11 patients (10 female, 1 male), discovered from 1997 to 2005 with histological, radiographic, and clinical characteristics consistent with tongue AVM. Four patients displayed advanced disease with malformations involving the tongue, floor of mouth, and neck. Contributions from multiple feeding arteries were identified by angiography as each patient reported a prior history of surgical or embolic procedures. These lesions required preoperative embolization and extensive resection with complex reconstruction (mean operating time, 10.9 hr). One patient had evidence of recurrent disease (mean follow-up, 24.6 mo). In contrast, seven patients presented with discreet tongue malformations with a single feeding lingual artery. These patients reported no prior intervention, required only one resection (mean operating time, 2.8 hr), and have shown no evidence of recurrence (mean follow-up, 11 mo). Slight histologic differences between advanced versus focal tongue AVM were identified. This study suggests that tongue AVM can occur within a spectrum of disease with different clinical presentations, radiographic findings, and histology among patients with focal versus advanced lesions. Inadequate treatment is thought to contribute to collateral flow and disease progression in advanced AVM, making further management difficult. However, focal tongue AVM may represent early lesions that are more amenable to surgical management.

Recommendations for new riders. Carry extra food and water.. In winter time – Don’t rely on minimum lighting requirements. Consider carrying a front light. It is strongly recommended that riders use more that one rear red light.. Wear a reflective vest, reflective leg bands, and other brightly reflective clothing.. Carry a tool kit, spare inner tubes (and patches), and perhaps a spare fold-up tire. Be sure your pump is working.. Be prepared for weather. Make sure you take along clothes to protect you from cold and wet conditions.. Mud Guards are strongly recommended.. Ziploc bags are useful for keeping phones & food dry.. Road surfaces vary. Narrow tires suffer more impact punctures but wider tires have more drag. If riding a mountain bike, consider using slick tires.. Use a sensible gear range.. Author: Colm Staunton

The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for secure distribution of program content, which are directed to the prevention of unauthorized copying and/or distribution of the program content.
Program content may include application programs, such as video game programs, word processing programs, spread sheet programs, etc.; and system programs, such as operating systems, boot programs, etc. Program content, such as computer programs, are typically distributed to end-users by way of transportable storage media, such as CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, etc., which contain the program content. Program content may also be distributed to end-users by way of downloading the program content over a network, such as from a server to the user over the Internet.
The conventional methods for distributing program content are not secure because unauthorized copies thereof may be made and shared among a plurality of end-users. For example, if a computer program is distributed to a particular end-user by way of a storage medium, that user may permit unauthorized copies of the computer program to be distributed and stored on equipment controlled by other end-users. Typically, these unauthorized copies are stored on hard disk drives, CD-ROMs, and the like. Similarly, if the computer program is distributed to the end-user by way of transmission over a network, unauthorized copies of the computer program may be made and distributed to other users. For example, once the computer program is stored on the authorized end-user's equipment, he or she may forward a copy of the computer program to another user by way of a storage medium (e.g., an optical disk, a magnetic disk, etc.) or by way of an attachment to an electronic mail message.
Accordingly, there are needs in the art for new methods and apparatus for the secure distribution of program content to end-users, which ameliorates the problems associated with the proliferation of unauthorized copies of the program content.

Curious how your email marketing fares against the average email marketer? Silverpop’s 2012 Email Marketing Metrics Benchmark Study has those figures. Check ‘em:. 1. Identify the trouble spots. If your open rate is significantly beneath even the average, you’re probably dealing with a largely inactive list. That could drive a decision to launch a re-engagement initiative or rethink your acquisition process.. 2. Use the numbers to lobby for the additional budget resources you need to improve your program. Be sure to focus on the areas that have the greatest potential to help you achieve departmental or corporate goals, such as higher revenue, reduced expenses, more conversions or better customer retention.. Remember, benchmarks tell you what’s average, not necessarily what’s target for your industry or your program. But they can offer some insight into what’s typical and motivate you to keep improving your own program.

Inside Intelligence: About Those Political Plans...

The attorney general has $12 million in his campaign account and has done a terrible job of keeping secret his ambition to run for governor of the state. The governor, meanwhile, has three years left in his term, is just back from a fruitless run for president and is trying to knock down any talk that he might be a lame duck. He's done that by saying he might run for another term in the middle office and hasn't ruled out another run for president, should the stars align.

So what if they ran into each other in 2014? The insiders think Greg Abbott would win. Only a third picked Rick Perry in that hypothetical head-to-head, while 60 percent would bet on the AG.

We asked about real races, too. With four well-funded candidates (from a total of 10) seeking the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, 62 percent of the insiders expect a runoff in that race; about a third expect it to end in the first round, on May 29.

The only current officeholder in the race for the open seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, state Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, is the insiders' favorite to win that contest. While 56 percent chose Chisum, 39 percent think the winner will be Christi Craddick.

We closed with an essay question this week, asking the insiders — on the eve of a new filing period for political races in Texas — who might provide the biggest surprises.

As always, we have attached the full set of verbatim answers to the questions. A sampling follows:

Who would win a Republican gubernatorial primary between Greg Abbott and Rick Perry?

• "At this point, just about anybody could beat Perry in the Republican primary--which is why I don't think Perry will run again. If Dewhurst wins a 6-year U.S. Senate term, even he might decide to challenge Perry. Then, Dewhurst could have the job he always wanted and also appoint his replacement in Washington. Such a deal."

• "What are you kidding?! After that presidential debacle it will be ANYBODY BUT PERRY!"

• "The frost is off that pumpkin. This presidential primary wasn't exactly a Phil Gramm '96 failure. It was an embarrassment of the state. His repeated failures were a reflection on all Texans. The R's would rather shoot their own dog than have D's shoot it for them."

• "The last Texan to beat Rick Perry in a Texas primary was... Gimme a minute. It'll come to me. Damn, what was his name?"

• "Question assumes Perry would actually run again, and Abbott would have the political chops to take him on. He doesn't."

• "Abbott's main, and perhaps only, argument that he can use in unseating Perry, is that 'it's time for him to go.' That didn't work for KBH. Republicans are going to have a hard time throwing out Perry without a really good reason. What's he done that Republicans have really hated?"

• "They both appeal to the same segment of Republican primary voters. Perry has long-term relationships on his side, but Abbott has a mostly unvarnished record on his."

Will there be a runoff in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate this year?

• "Yes, and it will be ugly."

• "Money like love conquers ALL! Hello Senator Dewhurst!"

• "Dewhurst should have a comfortable margin but under 50% because of the size of the field."

• "Dewhurst will drown out the others on TV and win without a runoff."

• "Still can't see a combo of Cruz/Leppert/James getting to 50%, but the later we keep moving the date back, that probability increases exponentially."

• "Whether or not Dewhurst can get to 50% in the first round is an open question, but he better hope he can. A low turnout runoff would be a nightmare scenario for him, and would render his name ID and financial advantages irrelevant. Look for the Dew to launch a takedown of Cruz in the next couple of months."

• "It depends on if some of the lesser candidates continue with their vanity campaigns."

• "Absent a major misstep by Dewhurst, there will be no runoff. Polls that say otherwise are not credible."

Who will win the race for Elizabeth Ames Jones' seat on the Texas Railroad Commission?

• "Who's for eliminating the agency?"

• "Not the most-qualified, the one who has worked in the industry for decades. Instead it’ll likely be the flake who’s-out-but-may-now-be-back-in after winning the Ft. Worth straw poll, or the entitled daughter of a certain former speaker, or the far right's favorite legislator."

• "In a down ballot this cycle, Chisum's history of social conservatism gives him a huge edge."

• "The one woman with the last name people have heard before? Yeah, that one."

• "Would hope one of the others, but the name CRADDICK will be the most recognized name in this race"

• "Becky Berger will be disappointed to learn that 'Inside Intelligence' does not have her in the race. A runoff in the GOP is likely between Craddick and one of the white guys. The winner of that will be the next Commissioner."

• "Warren has all of the advantages of experience in the industry, personal connections galore, and decades as a public figure. He's campaigning with all the energy of a 20-year-older to boot. Christi might make it in politics one day, but this isn't the day."

• "All one had to do is look at the resumes. I believe Chisum will be strong and have what it takes to win it. Those that support him publicly, however, will feel the pain next session. Dads hate when someone messes with their daughter."

• "Names are powerful. Look at Carrillo, the odds-on, industry-backed favorite, an incumbent no less, getting upended by Porter, a complete unknown. Craddick could win this on name alone."

As soon as election dates are set, the federal redistricting judges have said they will set a new deadline for campaign filing, allowing candidates to sign up for races, to drop out, or to amend filings they made earlier. What will be the biggest surprise? [Editor's note: We asked this before the court set a May 29 primary and a March 9 filing deadline.]

• "Pete Gallego might actually have a real race."

• "A last minute serious challenger to a 'comfy' incumbent."

• "An actual election!"

• "Doggett switches to U.S. Senate race."

• "Debra Medina for Railroad Commissioner"

• "Who doesn't run again!"

• "North Texas state senate races"

• "More House members announcing their retirement."

• "No surprises. It's hard to keep a secret in our political world. The birds like to sing."

• "If I told you it would not be a surprise."

• "How about the biggest surprise is that the courts decided to act after wasting weeks of time and tons of money?

Treatment o f Ln2(S 0 4)3 • nH 20 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm. Eu, Gd ; n -8, 9) with phenelzine dihydrogen sulfate, (phzH2) S 0 4, in 1 N H2S 0 4 yields polymeric complexes with the general formula [L n (S 0 4)2(H 20) 2(phzH)], which contain the phzH+ cation as a ligand. The compounds have been characterized by elem ental analyses, X-ray powder patterns, thermal methods, magnetic susceptibilities and spectroscopic (IR, Raman, electronic diffuse reflec tance and solid-state emission f -f spectra) studies.

This invention relates to a device for disposing of a recording medium by forming thereon a provisional record of a pattern, such as a picture, and by thereafter processing the provisional record into a final record of the pattern. The device may be, for example, an electrostatic facsimile receiver.
In a facsimile transmission and reception system, a transmitter supplies a receiver or receivers with signals representative of a picture or the like. In a conventional electrostatic facsimile receiver, a continuous recording paper is caused to pass by a recording unit for forming thereon latent images of a plurality of successive pictures and is subsequently fed into a developing and fixing unit for developing and fixing the latent images into visible reproductions of the respective pictures. In such a receiver, particularly for the known runlength-coded signals or for similar signals with redundancy reduction, the speed at which the recording paper runs by the recording unit towards the developing and fixing unit is adjusted in compliance with the speed selected at the transmitter in consideration of the density of lines or the like of each picture. As a result of the variation in the speed of feed, unevenness or irregularity in developing and fixing has been unavoidable to deteriorate the reproduced pictures. Deterioration of a record has been inevitable also in a device for disposing of a continuous sheet or separate sheets of recording medium when the medium is caused to pass by a recording unit towards a provisional record processing unit with various speeds of feed.

Unverricht-Lundborg disease with cystatin B gene abnormalities.
The clinical, neurophysiologic, and genetic findings in two Japanese patients with the Unverricht-Lundborg type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy are described. The cystatin B gene of Patient 1 exhibited expansion of the dodecamer (12-mer) repeat located in the 5' region and a point mutation (G-->A mutation) in exon 2. The cystatin B gene of Patient 2 exhibited homozygous expansion of the dodecamer repeat. Both parents of Patient 2 were heterozygous carriers. The two patients had a similar clinical course, and their symptoms were similar to those of previously reported patients in Finland. They both had a good response to zonisamide and low-dose primidone. We recommend that zonisamide and low-dose primidone should be introduced as the first drugs of choice for the treatment of patients with the Unverricht-Lundborg type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy.

The Best Diet for Weight Loss

As an obesity physician, I survey all of my patients about their diets. I also make note of the patients who are the most successful at losing and keeping off their weight. There is ONE trait that every successful patient shares in common. Is it their carbohydrate count? Are they vegans? Do they track their calories on an app? Are they on amphetamines? The answer may shock you…. or maybe not.

The answer: They all found their own way to sustainably lower their energy intake.

When I get a new patient coming in for weight loss, I give them my book The Fat Loss Prescription (Get through Amazon here,). I tend to push a more “Mediterranean” style low carbohydrate diet, which focuses on foods that are shown to improve mortality AND satiety (the satiety is important for sustainability). But as I work with the patients throughout the months, the diet changes into something that fits the patient’s personal preferences and life schedule.

Here is just a handful of ways they do it:

They literally keep their same diet, but found a way to eat less of it. Maybe they eat slower now or maybe they keep the extra servings in the kitchen. Many will use salad plates instead of dinner plates to trick their mind into thinking they ate just as much. Some of then do in fact track their calories with an app and when they get to their calorie goal, they stop. This one always makes me smile because I think it is less than ideal but who the hell am I to judge?

They went to a low carb or vegan diet (or another diet that restricts food groups). How could I lump these things together? These diets totally cut out either a whole macronutrient (like carbohydrates) or food groups (animal products). Paleo works as well for the same reason. These also entail (should anyway) increasing vegetables and other high satiety foods. Either way, many will not need to track their calories because their calories will be lowered automatically if they follow the diet correctly.

They replaced meals. People think protein shakes are just for meat heads. However, there is a lot of evidence that replacing your meals with a low energy protein shake will increase your chances at weight loss success. You replace a high calorie meal with a low calorie, high satiating protein shake. Makes sense.

They practice fasting. I have had some patients go to an intermittent fasting style of dieting. Whether they cut 1-2 days or restrict when they eat during the day, they find that this works better than just keeping calories controlled all day every day.

I am getting quite annoyed at the arguing over which diet is best for weight loss. There are physicians, researchers, fitness professionals, etc. who demand that their way is best. The most vocal are the low carbohydrate advocates as they blame obesity on insulin. I am an advocate of a low carbohydrate diet (especially for my insulin resistant/pre diabetic/type 2 diabetic patients). However, you would be astonished at how many of my patients who are successful who do not follow a low carbohydrate diet. It would be nice if we could just shift our efforts from arguing online to helping those who are actually in need of weight loss.

Improving the quality of operation notes: Effect of using proforma, audit and education sessions.
Both from a medical and legal point of view, the quality of operative notes are important. In this study we hypothesized that the quality of operation notes could be improved by audit, education session and using a proforma. A total of 150 operation notes were audited for compliance with the Royal College of Surgeons guidelines. Results were announced in-clinic training session and guidelines were discussed. An aide-memoire containing guideline parameters placed in the operating theaters. After eight months, operation reports were re-audited on an equal number of patients. An operative note proforma was developed and third audit was carried out. The results of each audit were compared. In the first audit, it was found that fourteen parameters were written with more than 90% accuracy. The first audit revealed seven poor areas in documentation: time of operation (0%), identification of emergency/elective procedure (0%), identification of any prosthesis or devices used (65.3%), details of closure technique (36.6%), name of anesthesiologist (0%), patient position (1.3%), and amount of bleeding (0%). In the second audit there was an incomplete, but significant improvement in these seven parameters (28%, 28.6%, 82%, 75.3%, 31.3%, 32%, and 34% respectively). Following introduction of the proforma; third audit cycle demonstrated a clear improvement in operation note documentation with at least 80% compliance in all parameters. This study revealed that the accuracy of the operating room documents can be improved through audits, education of surgeon and using proformas. The use of proforma provides much better results.

Outlook and Market Review - Third Quarter 2015. PDF File:. Summary:. The Bureau of Economic Analysis revised third quarter U.S. GDP growth to 2.1% from the flash report of only 1.5%. Most of the revised gain was due to inventory adjustments, which may constrain fourth quarter growth. On a year-over-year basis the economy continues to track along a 2.2% to 2.4% growth trend. Inflation continues to be below the Fed target of 2% for both the core and headline personal consumption expenditure (PCE) indices. Weak demand and low energy prices are expected to keep inflation below the Fed target throughout 2015 and most of 2016. The unemployment rate is 5%, close to what may be full employment given current conditions. Nevertheless, capacity utilization remains well below full employment levels with ample room for expansion before excess demand pressures and bottlenecks introduce inflation pressures.

I've had mine for about 9 mos or so and was looking to try and get rid of the stuff the phone accumulates that we just don't need. Invalid extensions, unused files etc. I understand that a data/cache wipe is one way. Is there a specific way to do this? I'm running BB 0.4 and I'm about to install Indigo Glass. I was hoping to start over fresh with the droid. I have Titanium Backup and Rom Manager. Will a quick backup with one of those save all of my essential data? If not, how do I save the good stuff and not the bad? Thanks, all.

The stroke navigator: meaningful use of the electronic health record to efficiently report inpatient stroke care quality.
To facilitate high-quality inpatient care for stroke patients, we built a system within our electronic health record (EHR) to identify stroke patients while they are in the hospital; capture necessary data in the EHR to minimize the burden of manual abstraction for stroke performance measures, decreasing daily time requirement from 2 hours to 15 minutes; generate reports using an automated process; and electronically transmit data to third parties. Provider champions and support from the EHR development team ensured that we balanced the needs of the hospital with those of frontline providers. This work summarizes the development and implementation of our stroke quality system.

Blood pressure is the major driving force for plaque formation in aortic-constricted ApoE-/- mice.
Using an aortic constriction model in mice, we studied whether the increase in pressure or the activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and its main receptors is the main driving force for plaque progression. Male ApoE mice underwent sham surgery or placement of a suprarenal silver clip around the aorta (AoC). Half the group was treated with the selective AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (30 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks. Anesthetized mean arterial pressure (MAP) was increased in AoC mice compared to sham (106 +/- 3 versus 90 +/- 1 mmHg, P < 0.001). Losartan reduced MAP in sham mice (78 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.01) but not in AoC (AoC losartan 104 +/- 2 mmHg). Plasma renin concentration (PRC) was increased in AoC mice compared to sham [1.6 +/- 0.3 versus 0.8 +/- 0.2 milliGoldblatt units (mGU)/ml, P < 0.001]. Losartan treatment augmented this difference (18.7 +/- 3.7 versus 4.6 +/- 1.7 mGU/ml, P < 0.01). AT2 receptor mRNA expression was increased 5.8-fold by aortic constriction in thoracic aorta (P < 0.05) and the major site for expression of the AT2 receptor protein was within the plaques. The plaque area was increased in AoC mice compared to sham (0.61 +/- 0.09 versus 0.07 +/- 0.01%, P < 0.001); however, losartan did not alter plaque area. Our data do not support a role for the AT1 receptor in the progression of atherosclerosis in this model, since blockade with losartan did not alter plaque distribution. Furthermore, we found no support for the counteraction of atherogenesis by increased activity of the RAS acting on the AT2 receptor. Our data suggest that increased pressure is the main driving force for atherosclerosis in this model.

My mother used to make pot roast in foil, and this evening I’m carrying on the family tradition. Tear off about a five-foot piece of 18-inch-wide aluminum foil. Set the piece of pot roast in the center of it; surround it with chunks of potato, baby carrots, and an onion, cut into chunks. Sprinkle on a couple tablespoons of minced garlic and two packets of Lipton’s Onion Soup mix. Fold the foil into a packet, creasing the seams so they’re steam-tight. Before you seal the packet, add about a quarter-cup of water. Set the packet in a baking pan and cook in the oven at 350F for about two hours. Yummy goodness. Mrs. R says you can do it in the crock-pot, but it’s just not the same. Part of it must be the ritual of preparation..

The Department of Health and Human Services has officially released the final rule for the Quality Payment Program under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA).. The Quality Payment Program, which will begin on January 1, 2017, replaces the sustainable growth rate and will reportedly allow providers to deliver more flexible, patient-centered care. According to HHS, MACRA and the Quality Payment Program will help drive the industry away from a volume-based system to value-based care models. The Quality Payment Program will reward providers for value-based care via two avenues: Advanced Alternative Payment Models (Advanced APMs) and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS).

1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to compositions for use as adhesion promoters on polyolefin substrates and to a method of applying such compositions to the polyolefin substrate. More particularly, the present invention relates to compositions containing chlorinated polyolefins for use as adhesion promoters and to a method of applying such compositions to polyolefin substrates.
2. Brief Description of the Prior Art
Polyolefins such as ethylene and propylene as well as copolymers thereof are being used in increasing amounts in the fabrication of automobile bodies and trim such as front end fascia and filler panels located between the bumper and the chassis. These materials are light weight and have excellent impact resistance. They can withstand low speed collisions much better than metal counterparts. However, to be aesthetically acceptable, the polyolefin must be painted to match the paint on the rest of the automobile. Because of the low surface tension of polyolefins, it is very difficult to adhere paint directly to the surface of the polyolefin.
It is known in the industry that the adhesion of a paint layer to a polyolefin substrate can be improved if the substrate is first treated with an adhesion promoter. Typical adhesion promoters are solutions of chlorinated polyolefins which when applied as a coating to the polyolefin substrate act as a tie layer between the polyolefin and the subsequently applied paint. However, if the adhesion promoter is not applied uniformly to the polyolefin substrate, the adhesion of the subsequently applied coating will fail.
It is an object of the present invention to provide a detectable adhesion promoting composition, that is, one which when applied to the polyolefin substrate can be determined if it has been applied uniformly to the substrate.

WHY IS THIS TOPIC IMPORTANT?. The subconscious mind and the non-voluntary behavior of our nervous system gives us much trouble in life. I, therefore, find it extremely important to understand the mechanisms and what I can do about it to gain control over my behavior on all levels of life, both body and mind.. We have all heard about the subconscious mind as something outside yourself or a part of our mind we cannot control. Sometimes it works against us and we, therefore, need to reprogram it. We know very little about it and this can be frightening, especially when we realize how much it can impact our lives.. Continue reading “Conscious vs. subconscious mind, who am I?”

Identification of ononitol and O-methyl-scyllo-inositol in pea root nodules.
Ononitol (4-O-methyl-myo-inositol) and O-methyl-scyllo-inositol were identified in pea (Pisum sativum L.) root nodules formed by twoRhizobium leguminosarum strains. Ononitol was the major soluble carbohydrate in nodules formed by strain 1045 while O-methyl-scyllo-inositol and two unidentified components were dominant in the carbohydrate pattern of the nodules formed by strain 1 a. The cyclitols were also present in the denodulated roots, but to a much smaller extent; in the above-ground plant parts only traces were found. The identification of ononitol and O-methyl-scyllo-inositol was established by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry utilizing trimethylsilyl- and acetyl-derivatives.

Tannic acid exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on formalin-induced paw edema model of inflammation in rats.
The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between anti-inflammatory effects of the natural polyphenolic compound tannic acid (CAS number: 1401-55-4) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme activity in paw edema model. Thirty-five female rats were divided into five groups. The paws of rats were injected subcutaneously in the plantar surface with formalin except for the control group. Indomethacin and tannic acid were intraperitoneally administered 1 h after formalin injection. The paws volume was measured by using vernier caliper. MPO enzyme activity was determined using 4-aminoantipyrine-phenol solution as the substrate for MPO-mediated oxidation by H2O2. About 17% and 13% edema inhibition has detected in the indomethacin-applied group, at the measurements run every other hour right after the treatment. An inhibition of 16% was found at the group treated with 25 mg/kg tannic acid. However, in the group treated with 50 mg/kg tannic acid, 15% and 7% of the edema inhibition was observed. Serum and paw tissue MPO activities were decreased in treated groups with indomethacin and tannic acid according to formalin control group. Our study results suggest that tannic acid may contribute to the treatment of inflammation by decreasing MPO enzyme activity, but the molecular mechanism is still not clear.

Enbridge gets EPA approval for 2012 oil spill cleanup plans.. Jason Manshum is an Enbridge spokesman. He says Enbridge’s plans for 20-12 include assessing how much submerged oil remains in the Kalamazoo River.. “That will determine…along with…looking at the science data we’re receiving…how much work …if any.. needs to be done…going into the summer and fall 2012," says Manshum.. That could mean scaling back the cleanup operation. However, state and federal environmental regulators will have the final say on when the oil spill cleanup will be complete.. In the meantime, Enbridge crews continue to remove oil from wetland areas this winter. And in the Spring, Enbridge crews will resume efforts to remove submerged oil from three different segments of the river.

Statement on Ecuador Court Ruling Against Chevron

Evidence Prevails Over Oil Giant's Intimidation Tactics

San Francisco, CA – Today a court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador has ruled in favor of the residents of Ecuador's Amazon region who have spent the last 18 years seeking damages for crude oil pollution. Chevron inherited the suit when it bought Texaco in 2001, and has denied the allegations of environmental damage.

Amazon Watch and Rainforest Action Network, who have spent years working to help the Ecuadorian people and protect the Amazon, release the following statement in response to today's verdict:

"As of today, Chevron's guilt for extensive oil contamination in the Amazon rainforest is official. It is time Chevron takes responsibility for these environmental and public health damages, which they have fought for the past 18 years.

"Today's ruling in Ecuador against Chevron proves overwhelmingly that the oil giant is responsible for billions of gallons of highly toxic waste sludge deliberately dumped into local streams and rivers, which thousands depend on for drinking, bathing, and fishing.

"Chevron has spent the last 18 years waging unprecedented public relations and lobbying campaigns to avoid cleaning up the environmental and public health catastrophe it left in the Amazon rainforest. Today's guilty verdict sends a loud and clear message: It is time Chevron clean up its disastrous mess in Ecuador.

"Today's case is historic and unprecedented. It is the first time Indigenous people have sued a multinational corporation in the country where the crime was committed and won.

"Today's historic ruling against Chevron is a testament to the strength of the Ecuadorian people who have spent 18 years bringing Chevron to justice while suffering the effects of the company's extensive oil contamination."

According to a survey published in Doane’s Agricultural Report, animal welfare is one of the top megatrends that agriculture faces today. Animal welfare came in at the No. 7 spot.. However, it’s important to remember that animal welfare and animal rights are not the same thing. People who are advocates of animal welfare want to spare animals physical pain and suffering — that’s something that livestock producers generally agree with as good animal husbandry makes both moral and economic sense. On the other hand, people who are animal rights advocates give human attributes to animals and consider all animal agriculture inhumane..

Not all of us are lucky enough to live near or by the beach where we can get the natural tan appearance. However, with the damaging effect of exposure to the sun, science and beauty experts have come up with a way to achieve sun-kissed glow without exposing one’s self to the harmful ultraviolet rays. Excessive sun exposure can cause wrinkles and may speed up aging. Hence, the sunless tanning.

Self-tanning or sunless tanning is an alternative to sunbathing. Self-tanning involves the application of chemicals to the skin to achieve sun tan. It has become popular after scientists and health experts have strengthen the link between exposure from the sunlight or tanning beds and skin cancer. In 1960, the first sunless tanning product by Coppertone was released in the form of a lotion. While self-tanner are commonly sold as lotion or spray that can be directly applied to the skin, there are also tanning pills and bronzers that emerged. Generally, self-tanning or sunless tanning is considered safe provided they are used as directed.

So how does a sunless tanner or self-tanner work? Before we move on to the specifics, it will be helpful to be reminded that self-tanning occurs in the epidermis or the outer layer of the skin. One active ingredient in self-tanning products is the dihydroxyacetone (DHA). The dihydroxyacetone is a colorless three-carbon sugar that, when applied, reacts with the dead skin cells. This reaction will result in a change of color and darkening the skin. As the skin gets a change in its color, you will likewise experience a starchy odor that usually comes during the tanning process. This odor is believed to be an indication of the progress of your sunless tan.

The color change is temporary and may last for only five to seven days. It is only temporary because only the stratum corneum, or the outermost layer of the epidermis, is stained. Eventually, this layer is shed by process of exfoliation especially with the use of exfoliating products or scrubs. Many have raised their eyebrows on the safety of the DHA. Since 1973, the Food and Drug Administration has approved DHA for external or self-tanning use. This is subject to an exception where the FDA has not approved the application of DHA near the eyes, mouth, or nose. It is advised to protect these parts of the body when applying self-tanning products, particularly in spray form also use one of the best self tanner on the market is very important.

Another method of sunless tanning is the use of bronzer. Bronzer, which is normally in the form of powder and moisturizer, stains the skin upon application. Unlike other methods, the stain from bronzer can be easily removed by washing it off with soap and water. For tanning pills, on the other hand, are generally considered as unsafe. They are said to contain canthaxanthin, which is used as color additive and in large amount when used as tanning agent. It turns your skin into an orange or brown color, which has been linked to liver damage, hepatitis, and visual impairment.

Behavioural thermoregulation and the relative roles of convection and radiation in a basking butterfly.
Poikilothermic animals are often reliant on behavioural thermoregulation to elevate core-body temperature above the temperature of their surroundings. Butterflies are able to do this by altering body posture and location while basking, however the specific mechanisms that achieve such regulation vary among species. The role of the wings has been particularly difficult to describe, with uncertainty surrounding whether they are positioned to reduce convective heat loss or to maximise heat gained through radiation. Characterisation of the extent to which these processes affect core-body temperature will provide insights into the way in which a species׳ thermal sensitivity and morphological traits have evolved. We conducted field and laboratory measurements to assess how basking posture affects the core-body temperature of an Australian butterfly, the common brown (Heteronympha merope). We show that, with wings held open, heat lost through convection is reduced while heat gained through radiation is simultaneously maximised. These responses have been incorporated into a biophysical model that accurately predicts the core-body temperature of basking specimens in the field, providing a powerful tool to explore how climate constrains the distribution and abundance of basking butterflies.

Gryglewicz, S.(., Mancini, L., Morellec, E., Schroth, E. and Valta, P. (2021). Understanding Cash Flow Risk Review of Financial Studies, :.. - Affiliated author. - Publication year2021. - JournalReview of Financial Studies. Theory has recently shown that corporate policies should depend on firms' exposure to short- and long-lived cash flow shocks and the correlation between these shocks. We provide granular estimates of these parameters for Compustat firms using a new filter that uses only cash flow data and the theoretical restrictions of a canonical cash flow model. As predicted by theory, we find that the estimated parameters are strongly related to corporate liquidity and financing choices, that firms with a higher estimated correlation between shocks implement riskier policies, and that the sign of this correlation determines the cash flow sensitivity of cash.

NHS Blood and Transplant Youth Campaign. Challenge. Mobas was asked by NHS Blood and Transplant to create a campaign that would specifically target the youth market and focus around college freshers. It needed to encourage sign up within that market and needed to have a fun approach.. Strategy. The real challenge was to create a campaign which appealed to a young market without appearing to be a corporate trying too hard to be ‘cool’. It was important to keep the campaign simple but to be very eye catching as the target market would be being hit with a lot of advertising and promotion from lots of different industries. It also needed to appeal to both males and females from different ethnic backgrounds.. Results. The campaign was rolled out across the country and received great feedback. It continues to stand out in a crowd and encourage donation from the target market.

Steven Spielberg has warned that a future ruled by virtual reality is coming "whether we like it or not".

Presenting his upcoming sci-fi film at this year's Comic-Con in San Diego on Friday, the acclaimed director addressed what has recently been a recurring topic for him.

Virtual reality, or VR, began its expansion in the film industry over the last year, with the Cannes Film Festival presenting its first VR entry this year.

Carne Y Arena (Meat And Sand) by Birdman director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu had its debut at the Croisette in May, opening alongside Spielberg's studio animation The BFG.

At the time, the Schindler's List director warned of the dangers virtual reality could present to the industry.


"I think we're moving into a dangerous medium with virtual reality," he said.

Spielberg goes VR for Ready Player One

"The only reason I say it is dangerous is because it gives the viewer a lot of latitude not to take direction from the storytellers but make their own choices of where to look.

"I just hope it doesn't forget the story when it starts enveloping us in a world that we can see all around us and make our own choices to look at."

Now he seems to have, if not changed his mind, at least embraced the future.

Presenting his new film Ready Player One, Spielberg spoke about the challenges of adapting Ernest Cline's book about a dystopian future where humans take refuge in VR after the world is destroyed by global warming.

In the film, the hero lives in 2044, but spends his time immersed in 1980s pop culture through virtual reality.

"It's the most amazing flash forward and flashback at the same time - to a decade I was very much involved in as well as a future that I think is out there awaiting all of us whether we like it or not," Spielberg said.

Image: Spielberg, Cline and actor Tye Sheridan shared the stage at Comic-Con

The 70-year-old director now sees VR as the opening of new possibilities, where humans are able to do "anything you can possibly imagine".

Directing Ready Player One, Spielberg was faced with 80s nostalgia and pop references related to his own work in the past, and said he feared being "vilified for some kind of grand act of grand larceny of vanity".

For the book's author, having the director taking on his book was a match made in heaven.

"To be honest with you, I thought this would never happen," Ernest Cline said at Comic-Con.

"I never thought we'd be able to make this movie, because we'd need someone like Steven Spielberg to direct it.

"And when they told me they were going to send it to him I was like, 'oh, he's never going to do it'."

Ready Player One premieres 30 March 2018.

Preferring Local Control

It’s two weeks already. Wow. The English thing is rad. Just think if Iowans had the guts to throw off the chains of the Federales. Caramba! But Iowans would rather have the crumbs than freedom and the prosperity that comes with it. Comfy, eh?

Preferring Local Control

Back in the days when socialism was failing in the Soviet Union (The system failed. Ronald Reagan had nothing to do with it.), I had a friend who traveled to Latvia on a farm tour. I remember what he found when he got there.

Imagine a field of oats, just beginning to head out, a stunted pale yellow with cracked soil easily visible through the canopy. The farmer had actually planted the oats in the rain because the call had come from Moscow, five hundred miles away, that it was time. The farmer ignored local conditions to be loyal to the central authority that had promised social justice at any price.

I doubt that any farmer hasn’t longed for the comfort of following orders at a job rather than the risk and responsibility of ownership.

The dairy operation was also an eye opener for the American tourist. No directive ever came for a manure management plan. The manure was pitched out of the barn, apparently so they could walk around in there, and that was it. When there was no room outside the doors and windows to pitch more, an elevator was set up and the manure deposited several feet from the barn until it reached up to the outlet of the elevator. The elevator was swung around in a half circle until the manure reached the top in all possible directions. Then another elevator was brought in.

The oats lacked fertilizer in the the hard baked mud. The farmer never hauled the manure onto the fields and he planted in the worst possible conditions. How could this happen?

The Brexit vote can shed a light on events that led up to the terrible management of that farm.

The most basic unit of government is the individual. Next we are part of a family, then a neighborhood, then a town, and so forth. Each step away from ourselves lessens the importance to us and also the quality of our decisions. It can’t be helped, as illustrated by the failure of the Latvian farmer and his Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

It could be argued that, not only is the European Union too big, but England is too big as well. There is evidence that there are neighborhoods in England where Sharia Law rules above the law of jolly old England. Space limits the description of the difference, but believe me, English Common Law is what we are used to and Sharia is not.

This is a direct result of a government that tries to be inclusive of too many cultures. Scotland and Ireland have become dependent on handouts from Mother England. Their economies have been weakened by the presence of someone else available to pay for careless management so they voted to remain in the union. Greece’s welfare state may have grown to unsustainable proportions with their dependence on the EU. But do the people of the more frugal and productive nations in the union deserve to spend part of each workday stuffing grape leaves for slothful olive farmers?

So far nothing has been written about actual consequences of Brexit, only about the emotional reactions rooted in the uncertainty of the change. But if you lived there would you like the EU (funny how that sounds like something stinks) making regulations to suit an entire continent? You can’t recycle a teabag? A child under eight can’t blow up a balloon? You can’t use better windows in trucks to make cyclists more visible?

Here in the U.S. we had a perfect example of a union of states that could compete and thus improve themselves or face loss of population. There is no federal constitutional authority for the laws that limit that competition today. There is no federal law against murder. If one state wanted a law making abortion legal, and another didn’t, the competition between the morally debased abortion state and the one that valued all its citizens would eventually sort out which society failed and which one flourished. The same would hold true for any number of issues: homosexual marriage, drug prohibition, corporate welfare, and environmental regulation come to mind.

I hope the Brexit vote inspires more governments to downsize and serve their people more efficiently. Our own Civil War was a turning point in American history. At least 600,000 people died to preserve a union that now rewards nonsense over voluntary relations.

We can be thankful to the EU for not resorting to murder to stifle Brexit, like Lincoln did.

I recently made a pair of biracial dolls with natural hair for a beautiful set of siblings from Chicago. It was so fun to make the little costumes for the dolls too. And I really love how the curls framing the little girl's face turned out!

Plastic surgeon Dr. Drew Ordon demonstrates how to rejuvenate marionette lines on the face to restore a youthful look.Read the full transcript »

Reversing Facial Marionette Lines Jim: Here’s a good one. This is on Facebook. This is Erica Thompson writing. She asks when my faces at rest, my lips go down at the corners. Is there a procedure to fix that? And it sounds a question, like a questions for Dr. Ordon there. Dr. Ordon: Now, Jim that such a great question. I get in the office all the time. What would help me is if I had prop out here, a little ahead to show people how would take care of that. Nobody likes that sneer look. You know, number one. What is cause? Well, it’s combination of gravity things falling a little bit and loosing volume in the face. How do I fix it? Well, typically it’s combination of two things. Thank you. Well, that’s what I called good service. So, you know, so called sneer or merry in that line, I see it all the time in the office. It’s when the corner of your mouth is down turn in here, it gives a sneering look to your face. It’s caused by two things; gravity, just gravity pulling down like so and as we age we also loose volume in the face. It’s a combination of gravity and volume. Dr. Shears: But if you keep smiling all the time. Dr. Ordon: Well, it’s a¿this isn’t as much as smiling as crows feet. Dr. Shears: Okay. Dr. Ordon: This is more gravity and volume. So how do we fix it? Well, number one we want to add volume to the corner of the mouth here that so called merry in that line with fillers typically hyaluronic acid and we do a little maneuver where we weave that hyaluronic acid right along the corner of the mouth and that will actually lift that mouth up a little bit. Finally, a little touch of buttocks right here, it will actually bring that lip up. So the solution typically two folds of fillers and some buttocks. Dr. Shears: With some fillers and buttocks. Jim: Which is fairly quick in the office procedure? Dr. Ordon: Yes. Because your face, what really isn’t going to help that spot. The face lift will help erase the wavy line, it will help you in the cheek, the jaw, with the botox stops right here, it’s not going to pull up the corner of the mouth. Dr. Shears: Thank you. Jim: Thank you Dr. Ordon. And Dr. Shears for sharing those great questions with us.

Egbert Coleby Morland

Egbert Coleby Morland  (1874–1955) was an English physician and medical editor.

After education at Whitgift School in Croydon and then at Bootham School in York, Egbert Morland studied at Owens College, Manchester, where he graduated BSc in 1893. By means of a scholarship, he studied medicine at St Bartholomew’s Hospital, where he qualified in 1897 MRCS and graduated in 1898 MB with the gold medal in physiology. He held appointments as house physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital and to the Great Ormond Street Hospital, but he developed pulmonary tuberculosis with haemoptysis. He had to abandon his house appointments and seek treatment in Switzerland. His fiancée Mary Latchmore insisted on marrying him (in 1903) and nursed him back to better health.

Morland decided to stay in Switzerland and to specialise in the treatment of tuberculosis. After education at the Protestant boarding school in Schiers, he studied medicine at Berne under Kocher and Sahli. Morland received the MD (Berne) with thesis Über die klinische Bedeutung der Opsonine in 1907 and, more importantly for his career, the Federal Diploma allowing him to practise medicine in Switzerland.

He practised as a pulmonary specialist in Switzerland for eleven years (1903–1914) first at Davos and then in Arosa, as director of the Villa Gentiana, a sanatorium for English-speaking patients. At Arosa he was a pioneer of the English colony and helped to build the Anglophone church. During the first year of WWI he served in France as part of a relief unit under the Friends War Victims Relief Committee (FWVRC), but in 1915 went to London and joined the editorial staff of The Lancet.

Morland also edited Maternity and Child Welfare: A Monthly Journal for Workers among Mothers and Children from 1917 to 1934. As editor-in-chief of The Lancet from 1937 to 1944, he was preceded by Sir Samuel Squire Sprigge and succeeded by Theodore F. Fox. Morland was elected in 1930 FRCS and in 1941 FRCP.

Morland and his wife, both Quakers, adopted two sons and a daughter. Egbert Morland came from a Quaker family and had four older brothers. One of his older brothers was Harold Morland, an accountant and auditor, who was Clerk of the Society of Friends from 1927 to 1932.

The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when you’re uncool.

In 2012, Wired contributor Mat Honan got hacked and this year Naoki Hiroshima got hacked. Why? In both cases people wanted to own their short Twitter handles. It’s strange to think that something so trivial and ultimately unimportant caused such a problem and in Honan’s case almost caused him to lose precious data that wasn’t backed up. Social engineering played a big part of the problem that led them to getting hacked and while there’s not a lot you can do about that you can at least make things more difficult on would-be hackers with two factor authentication. Two factor authentication requires something else in addition to a password to get access to something. It may be a text message to your device, an additional piece of information about yourself, a PIN that only you know, etc.

Techcrunch tells us of a site called TwoFactorAuth.org that keeps a list of services that offer two factor authentication and gives you an ability to let the sites that you rely on that don’t offer it that they should.

At a bare minimum, you should ensure that your domain registrar, emailprovider, and cloudproviders are all using it. Controlling a person’s email address gives you the ability to reset their passwords on any number of services and you don’t want people to be able to wipe any files / backups or be able to hold them hostage as was the case with Honan.

Follow-up study of British military hostages and their families held in Kuwait during the Gulf War.
On 2 August 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait and held hostage all its inhabitants. Amongst those forced to stay were 71 British servicemen and their families who were held hostage for up to four and a half months. This study investigated the mental health status of this group of individuals at 6 and 18 months after the final hostage was released. Participants completed the Impact of Event Scale and the 28-item version of the General Health Questionnaire at both 6 and 18 months. In addition they completed a questionnaire regarding background factors, the dimensions of the trauma and the effects of their hostage experience. The Impact of Event Scale scores changed little over time whereas the General Health Questionnaire scores reduced significantly (p = .001) over the 12-month period suggesting that despite ongoing intrusive and avoidance phenomena levels of psychological distress did reduce. Those variables most strongly associated with a poor psychological outcome were witnessing physical violence and perceived deterioration in physical and mental health. Poor outcome at 6 months was strongly correlated with poor outcome at 18 months.

Cold rolled drawn slit cutting steel flat bar is a beam with an I-shaped cross-section. The horizontal elements of the "I" are known as flanges, while the vertical element is termed the "web". Cold rolled drawn slit cutting steel flat bar is usually made of structural steel and is used in construction and civil engineering. The cold rolled drawn slit cutting steel flat bar resists shear forces, while the flanges resist most of the bending moment experienced by the beam. Cold rolled drawn slit cutting steel flat bar theory shows that the I-shaped section is a very efficient form for carrying both bending and shears loads in the plane of the web.. 2.

Are you more creative when you're drunk? It's one of those soundbites that you're liable to hear a friend spout off somewhere between their fourth and fifth beer — a little factoid that might actually sound somewhat feasible if only there were a scientific study lying around to back it up.


Fortunately for you, Jonah Lehrer — master of ceremonies over at Frontal Cortex — has served up a recently published study that proves that being drunk can, in fact, be great for creativity. (As an added bonus, he throws in a second paper that shows the same can be said about being sleepy.)

So how do alcohol and grogginess help you wring as much creative juice out of your brain as possible? According to Lehrer, they both help us "consider irrelevant information... eavesdrop on all the stray associations unfolding in the far reaches of the brain. We are more likely to find the answer because we have less control over where we look." He continues:

A brand-new study by scientists at the University of Illinois at Chicago compared performance on insight puzzles between sober and drunk students. (They were aiming for real intoxication, giving students enough booze to achieve a blood alcohol level of 0.075.) Once the students achieved "peak intoxication" the scientists gave them a battery of word problems – they're known as remote associate tests – that are often solved in a moment of insight. Here's a sample problem. Your task is to find the one additional word that goes with the following triad of words: Cracker Union Rabbit In this case, the answer is "jack." According to the data, drunk students solved more of these word problems in less time. They also were much more likely to perceive their solutions as the result of a sudden insight. And the differences were dramatic: The alcohol made subjects nearly 30 percent more likely to find the unexpected solution.

The ARU had been deciding whether to remove either the Melbourne Rebels or Force but, after a two-week arbitration with RugbyWA, the ARU said they had decided to "discontinue the Western Force Super Rugby license".

The Rugby Union Players Association issued a swift response, declaring the ARU's decision as the abandonment of the game's "national footprint".

Editor's Picks

The Australian Rugby Union [ARU] has removed Western Force from Super Rugby, but is adamant Western Australia won't be abandoned by the 15-man game.

"Today's is the darkest day in the history of Australian Rugby with the custodian of the game confirming their desire to end the tenure of the Western Force and abandoning the game's national footprint."

"The future of professional Rugby in Western Australia will now be the collateral damage of the decision making of the ARU and SANZAAR to expand Super Rugby to a convoluted and complicated 18 team structure against various advice and modelling received which explained the associated risks."

"Players, staff and their families at the Western Force have been put under unprecedented and, quite frankly, completely unreasonable duress throughout this ridiculous and destructive process."

Good-natured teasing is a good tool of learning how to find a nice in a group and adjust.. I find myself to be slightly socially retarded, in that I am frequently unable to tell when someone is joking or teasing. I tend to assume people are being serious by default. But I also think I have a good sense of humor; it's just not the same sense as everyone else seems to have. It's like my brain doesn't pick up on some of these subtle cues.. If humor, intelligence, intellect, or sheer largess of being are used to make a point forcefully then it's a case of bullying. Per me.. Joking and enjoying humor in a group is a healthy part of relating. Absolutely. The more, the better and the more adjusted the person.. Teasing respectfully is a sign of intimacy, I always thought.. it's healthy to learn to relate to others with humor.

The provincial government and Nova Scotia's doctors have reached a new contract agreement that the president of Doctors Nova Scotia believes will bolster recruitment and retention.

The contract, which includes an eight per cent raise over four years and moves family doctors and some specialists to the top of their pay scales in Atlantic Canada, was approved by the membership of Doctors Nova Scotia this week and released Wednesday. About 69 per cent of eligible members voted on the deal, which received 95 per cent support.

Dr. Gary Ernest, president of Doctors Nova Scotia, said having doctors at or near the top of pay scales in Atlantic Canada will help keep doctors in the province and bring back those with ties to here who left for greener financial pastures.

"It going to either equalize us or get us close enough to what people are earning in other provinces that it's going to make people say, 'You know, it's close enough or I'm ahead, I'll come to Nova Scotia,'" he said in an interview.

"The spinoff of that is access for the public."

In total, doctors will get $135 million more by the final year of the deal.

Dr. Gary Ernest is president of Doctors Nova Scotia and a family doctor in Liverpool. (CBC)

Beyond the eight per cent increase, there is an additional $42 million for family and emergency doctors, anesthesiologists, psychiatrists and obstetricians and gynecologists.

Although there have been a variety of shortages in Nova Scotia, psychiatry and anesthesia have been a particular problem for this province and the rest of Canada.

The rural retention bonus will double to $16,000 by the end of the contract, something Ernest, a family doctor in Liverpool, said is particularly significant.

"A lot of the rural specialists are holding together services by their fingernails because of difficulties with resources and they really deserve a lot of credit for working long hours, spending a lot of time on call," he said.

Premier Stephen McNeil says getting the contract signed means doctors and the government can now focus on other aspects of the health-care system. (CBC)

Premier Stephen McNeil said the deal is affordable, leaves room to hire more people if recruitment does increase and should make it easier now to deal with other issues, such as maximizing the use of health-care teams.

"This contract [negotiation] was preventing, in my view, for us to have other conversations," he told reporters in Halifax.

That includes how to have doctors who retire early work on a periodic basis in areas that need extra help, or continue to cover long-term care homes even after closing the rest of their practice.

"Those are the kind of innovative conversations we'll start having now with Doctors Nova Scotia," McNeil said.

He said it was clear more needed to be done for certain doctors because of how competitive recrutiment has become. He noted the overall raise to all doctors is generally in keeping with what's being offered to public servants, while allowing for the fact doctors don't have access to government benefits or pensions.

Other incentives in the deal

The deal includes support for succession planning, which would see a new doctor and retiring doctor be allowed to overlap and work together as they make the transition without interrupting service to patients.

There is a promise to reduce the paperwork burden for things such as securing a locum and there will be increased stipends for doctors mentoring medical students in communities. Those programs have been particularly successful in rural communities and Ernest said the stipend, while only $450 a week, is important.

Family doctors have also secured a pilot program for a new blended capitation payment model, a system in which doctors receive a combination of salary and a fee for services. The model is used in New Brunswick with some success.

Getting to this point has not always been smooth, with doctors in some parts of the province refusing to provide certain services in protest of what they viewed as unfair wage disparities with counterparts in other regions of Nova Scotia. Things become particular tense in Cape Breton when the government gave a raise to hospitalists who focus only on inpatient care.

McNeil and Ernest said they hope terms in the contract intended to address that disparity will be enough to get doctors back to providing all services.

Premier steps in

The nearly year-long negotiations seemed to stall several times and McNeil said he ultimately decided to become directly involved, contacting Ernest so he could get a sense of exactly what challenges doctors were facing.

"He has a very good understanding, quite frankly, of his membership and the concerns that were faced by specialists and how we needed to address those," McNeil said. "And there was give and take, and we landed and we arrived at this point."

Ernest said signing the deal is a positive step toward better relations and collaboration between the two sides.

"The tide has turned. Things are more positive now [and] they will become more positive," he said. "There's a lot of work to do yet, but this is the start; this is the start of a new era, if you will."

McNeil seemed to agree.

"My hope is that this puts us back on solid ground," he said. "My hope is that they recognize we have a fiscal responsibility to the entire province. At the same time, we've recognized and listened to some of the challenges they say were in the system and that this deal is fair to them and fair to taxpayers and addresses some of the issues that the system was ailed by."

The contract comes into effect upon signing, which is expected to happen later this week, and is retroactive to April 1, 2019.

About us

We are the Directorate-General of the European Commission in charge of the policy area known as "Migration and Home Affairs". We manage policies that aim at ensuring that all activities necessary and beneficial to the economic, cultural and social growth of the EU may develop in a stable, lawful and secure environment. More specifically, we work to build an open and safer Europe.

Building a common EU migration and asylum policy

We work to develop a balanced and comprehensive EU migration policy, based on solidarity and responsibility, which - in line with the Europe 2020 strategy - will make an important contribution to the Union's economic development and performance in the longer term. Our aim is to create an EU-wide set of rules for legal migration, while taking into account the interconnection between migration and integration. We also aim to address irregular migration and trafficking in human beings. At the same time, we work to set up a Common European Asylum System, based on solidarity and respect for fundamental rights, to ensure effective protection for the people who need it.

External dimension and funding of the EU home affairs policy

In all these areas, we promote dialogue and cooperation with non-EU countries so that we can work in partnership and jointly tackle common challenges. Our external action contributes to the strengthening of the Union's position as a reliable, active and pragmatic global player, while ensuring the effectiveness of our policies.

To cater for EU interests, whether concerning migration management or security, financial instruments must be at the level of the Union's ambitions. Sound and effective management of these instruments is an essential component of the Migration and Home Affairs policy. We also manage EU financing instruments that support concrete actions in the field of home affairs.

Europe for Citizens

Through this programme we aim to contribute to citizens' understanding of the EU, its history and diversity and foster European citizenship and improve conditions for civic and democratic participation at EU level.

The first customers were given the red carpet treatment with receptions, banquets and performances. Some of the first people said they were delighted to travel to Taiwan, many saying they've waited a long time to come. There's also excitement among Taiwanese who are hoping the influx in tourism will provide an economic boost. This travel service worker says the tourists could bring in millions of extra dollars every year. Small but peaceful groups of pro-Tibetans gathered outside the airport but were kept far enough away by Taiwanese security forces. A lot is at stake because the flights are the first signs of warmer relations between the two countries.. Direct flights between Taiwan and China. Comment

Nice find on the vaders. I have one on the way to me from California. I'm looking for the cape closed standing still vader with mini holo vader now. Him and the boba with flames in front and boba mini holo. You can see the misspelled stand on the leia with it still carded but its tough. The easiest way to tell is that the misspelled stand leia is on the datestamp 52441 and earlier, anything later is the correct stand.

I found both Chewie versions. Am I to assume the small link is the first version, and ultimately be the Harder to find version?

What's everyone else finding on this?

The small link version came after the the large link one according to datestamps but then again the bly with yellow armpits was first then on the next datestamp they had white armpits and then on the next datestamp they switched back to yellow from then on.

i actually found the small link version once way back when this wave was first released. since then, i have come across about 20 different chewies from various stores and all have been the large link version. i was under the impression the small link was much more rare.

KHLIERIAT, Meghalaya -- The National Green Tribunal ban on coal mining and transportation of coal in Meghalaya's Jaintia Hills region has resulted in many of those engaged in the activity switching to turmeric farming for their livelihood.

For the past one year, these coal-miners, who previously practised unscientific mining and transportation of coal, have taken to cultivation of famed curcumin-rich Lakadong turmeric varieties at their villages in East Jaintia Hills District.

D Rymbai, a resident, invested in turmeric cultivation in his six-acre barren land at Moolamylliang village.

Rymbai owned a few coal mines at the village and never thought of farming as a viable alternative to coal mining until April last year when the NGT issued the blanket ban.

"After the NGT ban, I was disillusioned as to what to do for my livelihood. We had become so dependent on coal mining prior to the ban," Rymbai said.

Like Rymbai, almost 90 per cent of the residents of the village were totally dependent on money that came from coal.

Rat-hole coal mining took over in the early 90s and in a span of 20 years, one could see holes dug up everywhere in the village land in search of coal and even paddy fields were not spared.

The April 2014 order of the NGT came as a game changer as people started looking for alternative source of income.

District Horticulture officer G Dohling says that the department has come up with a turmeric hub to promote cultivation of the famed Lakadong variety of turmeric.

The hub was built at a cost of Rs 50 lakh, funds from the 13th Finance Commission, and will benefit the local farmers, he said.

Meghalaya produces over 8,000 MT of turmeric in a year and majority of this production is concentrated in Jaintia Hills and Garo Hills region because of the favourable micro-climatic and soil conditions. .

According to horticulture department officials, there are at least 1,000 farmers engaged in turmeric cultivation and the number is likely to increase.

Jaintia Hills region consisting of two districts produces at least three varieties of turmeric - Lakadong, Laskein and Ladaw, each having their separate identity, a senior horticulture officer said.

The Indian Council for Agricultural Research data shows that the curcumin content of Lakadong variety is 6.0-7.5 per cent, about 2 per cent higher than the turmeric available in the market.

There is a very high demand from the pharmaceutical industry for these curcumin-rich turmeric varieties as it can be used in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and dye/food-colouring industries.

At present ITC Ltd is procuring Lakadong turmeric slices for extracting curcumin used for in its pharmaceutical units.

The Kentucky Wildcats took a break from the grind of fall camp to take a trip to the pool.. Clearly inspired by the diving competition in the Olympics, head coach Joker Phillips attempted a back flip at the 0:27 mark. It had decent form, but the judges will knock a few points off due to the poor entry.. The highlight of the video, without a doubt, is offensive guard Steven Duff. The 6'0", 330-pounder shows off his front flip, and adds in a half twist at the 1:25 mark, and then follows it up with another flip before deciding that flipping is overrated and splashes his teammates.. Wildcat players also showed off their technology and ability to multi-task, taking the camera with them on trips down the slide and off of the diving board.. Breaks like this aren't out of the ordinary during fall camp. Georgia head coach Mark Richt has taken his Bulldogs to the pool in the past, and even back-flipped off the high dive last season.. Way to keep things fun, Kentucky.

Is the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation exam more stressful for the surgeon than emergency department trauma care?
Stress affects surgeons both during training and during professional activity. To compare stress levels affecting surgical residents during the simulated initial assessment and management in the Advanced Trauma Life Support practical exam vs initial assessment and management of trauma patients in the emergency room. Eighteen surgical residents were evaluated under basal conditions, during the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation, and during emergency room initial care. Heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, and diastolic arterial pressure were measured. The Student t test was used to test for differences between means, with statistical significance declared when P < .05. Heart rate and systolic arterial pressure were increased at the beginning and at the end of Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation and emergency room initial care. Diastolic arterial pressure was only increased at the end of the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation. Comparing values obtained during the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation with those obtained during emergency room initial care, heart rate and systolic arterial pressure were significantly higher during the Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation both at the beginning and end of the test events. However, diastolic arterial pressure was only significantly higher for Advanced Trauma Life Support simulation compared emergency room at the end of the procedures. These results suggest that the simulation in the practical exam portion of the Advanced Trauma Life Support course is more stressful for the resident surgeon than is the actual initial assessment and care of trauma patients in an emergency room.

Eli Reed Blues Trio. In 2004, Eli “Paperboy” Reed stepped in to a basement studio in Boston, Massachussetts with a few friends and and a plan: To record the combination of Downhome Blues, R&B and Soul that they had been experimenting with in rehearsal and at clubs around the city.. Now, 10 years later, things are quite different. Reed has gone on to become a star on the international Soul scene, with three more full-length albums, many singles and hundreds of live shows around the world under his belt. As the 10 year anniversary of “Walkin’ and Talkin” approached, though, Reed began to think more and more about the magic that happened that day in the studio and that it might be time to revisit it.. Now, with Reed, the three of them are reuniting to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of that classic album with a tour and a vinyl-only reissue. This is a once in a lifetime even to see Eli “Paperboy” Reed return to his Raw Blues roots with just his guitar, his voice and his old friends supporting.

As the farm bill writhes in congressional death throes, Reason magazine reports that more than 170,000 deceased farmers received subsidies between 1999 and 2005. The total cost of these post-mortem outlays? More than $1 billion. Though official policy checks off on subsidies for up to two years after a farmer’s death (if the farm is still operational), a substantial portion of the payments were distributed beyond the time limit. The research originated in a July report by the Government Accountability Office (pdf). Then the shrugging commenced. —Michael Rowe

This was one of my favorite recent bird photos. Getting a sharp close photo of any songbird is usually somewhat of an accomplishment, but capturing one doing something “cutesy” can be especially endearing.. White-throated Sparrow. This photo was largely the result of right time, right place. But composition-wise I knew I wanted a bit of negative space on the right side of the frame, so the image would not appear too crammed. I went with an aperture of F/7.1 to pull some of the vegetation into focus as well as ensure decent sharpness throughout the bird’s body.. Advertisements

What do we think of when we think of siblings? We think of similarity, familiarity and a duality of human nature. In this photo series titled Siblings Azaan Shah brings out these qualities in his photos where similarity of subject matter is captured in a compelling way. The photo series Siblings, which is Azaan's long term project, is inspired by the photographer’s gaze to find a similarity in people and things which we see on a daily basis in the streets in Srinagar. The photos in this series have real-life siblings as subjects or people who somehow, through the photographer's vision, end up having quality of real life siblings.. Azaan Shah is a documentary photographer from downtown Srinagar. Azaan’s photos have been featured in a recently released photo book Witness: Kashmir 1986 – 2016 / Nine Photographers edited by filmmaker Sanjay Kak. The photographs in this series have been shot with a mobile camera and what is remarkable about them is the broad range of human emotions that they are able to convey..

Basil Tea: For Those Who Have Heart. The average human heart pumps up to two thousand gallons of blood a day. In the average lifetime, a person’s heart will pump one million barrels of blood. The heart works hard and never stops until death, making it an organ that everyone should take extra care of. Many factors contribute to cardiovascular health such as diet, exercise, and other lifestyle choices. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people are diagnosed with heart failure. Drinking basil tea can provide the nutrients necessary to avoid falling into that statistic.

With accusations of sexual harassment and worse, the most awful thing someone could put in the article was a woman was reprimanded for almost starting a fire in her living quarters and women are not allowed male visitors or overnight guests (which is in line with their culture and laws and was not uncommon for many groups of women in the U.S.up until not so long ago and I'll bet can still be found in some dormitories at colleges).?

I was pretty sure it should be "female flight attendants," not "woman flight attendants." "Woman" used as an adjective or noun adjunct sounds awkward and derogative to me (the easiest example I can think of is "woman driver"). Then I did a little google and fell into an internet grammar wormhole. Apparently "woman" is often allowed in this context in the style books of reputable news sources. I still don't like it.

Yes, but at such (often but not always religious) schools the policy is nearly already gender-symmetric (except AFAIK schools don't tend to bother to prohibit same sex overnight guests).

Also, the policies are rarely enforced, and frequently have more to do with building security (guests must be registered, etc.) than anything else.

And frankly, I don't understand why we allow college dorms housing what are legally adults, to make any requirements a landlord wouldn't be able to make. Especially when schools have residency requirements or off-campus housing isn't a realistic option.

Different country, though they're close to each other. Part of the Saudi Arabian shoreline is in between, though I've seen on older maps that Qatar and UAE apparently once bordered each other.

As for the working conditions, I always suspected that cruise ships were this way (but I really have nothing to corroborate that).

Speaking of the Arabian Peninsula, I have an old Nat'l Geographic globe from the mid-1960s. UAE was then Trucial States. Oman was Muscat and Oman, and the globe depicts it as narrow shading along the coastline, rather than showing actual boundaries (perhaps to differentiate from Oman proper though the globe isn't quite that old). Part of present-day Yemen was "South Arabia" and is similarly shown as existing only along the coastline.

The US has 1 mio immigrants each year, Qatar has 1.7 mio inhabitants. Here's a batshit idea: the US could offer all Qataris US citizenship, the offer limited to one year. That would sort thing out... Oh wait, is that one of those countries where woman can't get on a plane without signed consent from a male relative?

Boycott Qatar? At least spread the message so that people who go to work there know what they're getting themselves into, and know to send their salary out of the country each month to prevent it being seized. It sounds onerous to work there - but just possibly within the bounds of cultural differences - although the CEO of the airline sounds like an utter jerk. Qatar has different laws and different views about sex before marriage compared to Europe, America or most of the rest of the world. If people from Europe go in with their eyes open and take the view that it's a useful training experience and something to do for a year or two to get a line on their CV before moving on to a European or US (or anywhere else in the world) airline with proper working practices and employer relations, for some people it could be a tolerable experience.

That's not meaningful. They get their revenue from sources other than their airlines, and frankly the two dozen white people who do aren't going to have any impact.

Since when is a boycott an effective measure in a global economy? That's been the whole point of globalization- the demobilization of local and culturally specific factors inhibiting trade. Boycotts are the actions of the lazy and the impotent. Not that I have anything against the impotent, we're all largely impotent- but I'm against the delusion that we accomplish anything by specific inaction.

Qatar is the venue for the 2022 Football World Cup which, for those of you who know anything about football, is a big thing. If they want to host one of the biggest sporting events in the World they should expect people to start to look at them closely. I suspect this article will be the first of many. Whether it changes anything... well, I hope so.

Increased CNTF levels in adults with autism spectrum disorders.
Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a neurotrophin which could signal neuronal suffering and at the same time acts as a neuroprotective agent. In the present study we aimed to evaluate CNTF serum levels in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In fact, considering the role of CNTF as a neuronal damage signal and the role of neuroinflammation, excito-inhibitory imbalance and excitotoxicity in the pathogenesis of ASDs, a possible alteration of CNTF in ASDs could be hypothesised. We recruited 23 individuals with ASDs and intellectual disability (ID), 20 ID subjects and 26 typical adults. A complete medical and psychopathological characterisation of the participants was performed. CNTF serum levels were measured with ELISA. CNTF serum levels were significantly higher in the ASD + ID group compared to ID (p < .001) or typically developed subjects (p < .001). CNTF may be considered as a potential biomarker candidate for ASDs in the context of severe ID. Our results support the hypothesis of neurotrophic imbalance in ASDs.

The pan-European fiber operator Interoute added a bit more fiber to its network at its southern frontier this morning. They've added a new route to the rest of Europe from their landing stations in Mazaro del Vallo on the island of Sicily and Bari on the Adriatic Sea.. That's the toe and the heel of the boot for those with a more visual image of Italy, and the new route follows the southern coastline while adding 1,300 route kilometers of fiber. It provides new diversity to those submarine cables that land there rather then go all the way up to Marseilles, supplying three new 100G routes back to the rest of Interoute's European fiber network.. More of Interoute's focus lately has gone toward its cloud services, so it's nice to see a bit of news on the fiber side. They did also make an inorganic move up in the UK with the purchase of Vtesse last year, giving them deeper British reach.. Discuss this Post

1. Field of the Invention
This invention is concerned with improvements in machines for conforming portions of shoe uppers to the shapes of their corresponding lasts.
2. Prior Art
Various proposals have been made to provide automatic or semi-automatic shoe machines for lasting side portions of shoes which require little or no attention by a machine operator apart from presentation of the shoe and removal of the shoe from the machine. It has been proposed to load and unload machines by an automatic shoe presenting and removing device. Some of the proposed machines employ helically ribbed wiping rolls for wiping marginal portions of an upper of a shoe assembly. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,591,878, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, discloses a shoe machine having independently mounted wiping rolls for performing a side lasting operation simultaneously along the opposite side portions of a shoe assembly. The wiping rolls are displaced widthwise of the shoe assembly in accordance with variations of outline shape of the shoe bottom, utilizing template means for controlling the widthwise displacement of the wiping rolls as they operate progressively along the shoe bottom. The U.S. Pat. No. 3,908,216, also assigned to the assignee of the present invention, discloses a shoe machine having lasting rolls which are arranged to simultaneously wipe marginal portions of opposite sides of the upper of a shoe assembly so that the upper and insole become secured together by adhesive applied therebetween. Means for effecting relative movement lengthwise between the lasting rolls and the shoe supporting means causes the rolls to operate progressively along side portions of the shoe assembly. Each of the lasting rolls has a wiping element disposed helically about a circumferential portion of the roll. The lasting rolls are supported by roll-carrying means that extend at least substantially widthwise of the shoe assembly being operated upon. The roll-carrying means are capable of arcuate movement about an axis extending generally lengthwise of the bottom of the shoe assembly. The side lasting rolls of the machine just referred to are of sufficient length to operate upon the marginal portions of the upper without widthwise displacement of the rolls. The specification of U.S. Pat. No. 3,971,089, again also assigned to the assignee of the present invention, describes a machine which is generally similar but which has means for changing the angle included between the axes of the two lasting rolls at the opposite sides of the shoe to suit it to different transverse curvatures of different portions of the shoe bottom.
Various proposals have been made to combine lasting of a shank portion of a shoe assembly with a heel seat lasting operation on the shoe assembly in a single machine which would effect a reduction of manpower as compared with a two-machine system requiring two operators. While some success has been achieved by the use of the combined machines, the machines have had certain limitations as to the extent of the side lasting operations. Some of the proposals have required a considerable amount of adjustment of the lasting arrangement by the machine operator and are not fully automatic machines.
One of the various objects of the present invention is to provide an improved shoe machine having heel seat lasting and side lasting arrangements which are capable of automatically lasting the whole of the side and seat portions of a shoe assembly heelwardly of the portion lasted by a pulling over and toe lasting machine.

Multiple Tornadoes Confirmed Saturday Across the Area, Damage Reported. By: David Shepherd, Director of News & Public Information / Photo Submitted By: Neil Forler. TELL CITY -- The National Weather Service has confirmed multiple tornadoes touched down in the area Saturday.. An EF – 0 hit Main Street in Tell City, damaging roofs and bending an amateur radio tower.. A tree blew onto a garage in town and multiple large trees were downed.. The twister had peak winds between 70 mph – 80 mph and was on the ground for just under two miles before breaking up at the northern end of Quaker Road.. An EF-1 tornado also touched down in Stanley in neighboring Warrick County.. That one packed winds of 110 mph and cut a 2 and a quarter mile path, blowing out a wall of a home and damaging roofs and crops.. An EF 0 tornado was also confirmed in Hancock County, Kentucky.. Luckily, no injuries reported in any of Saturday’s tornadoes.

Q:

From FullyName string to Type object

Anyone know how to get a Type object from a FullName?
Eg. 
string fullName = typeof(string).FullName; 
Type stringType = <INSERT CODE HERE> 
Assert.AreEqual(stringType, typeof(string) 

A:

string fullName = typeof(string).FullName; 
Type stringType = Type.GetType(fullName);

However, note that this only searches the calling assembly and core MS assemblies. It is better to use either the AssemblyQualifiedName, of find the Assembly first, and use Assembly.GetType(fullName).
Either:
string qualifiedName = typeof(string).AssemblyQualifiedName;
Type stringType = Type.GetType(qualifiedName);

or
Assembly a = typeof(SomeOtherTypeInTheSameAssembly).Assembly;
Type type = a.GetType(fullName);

Update re comments; note that AssemblyQualifiedName includes versioning information; this is fine for use in things like configuration files, but if (as is the case here) you are using this for persistance, it is often better to use an implementation independent contract. For example, xml (via XmlSerializer or DataContractSerializer) is not concerned about the specific types, as long as the layout is correct.
If space is an issue, binary formats are often shorter - but BinaryFormatter includes type metadata, and isn't platform independent (try consuming it from java, for example). In such cases, you might want to look at custom serializers such as protobuf-net, which is contract-based, but using Google's "protocol buffers" cross-platform wire format.

Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight released two videos on Friday reaffirming his support for President Donald Trump, who he called "the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln."

Addressing the videos to the "people of the Republican Party," Voight praised Trump's job efforts, which he claims has been difficult, "for [Trump's] battling the left and their absurd words of destruction."

"I'm here today to acknowledge the truth, and I'm here today to tell you, my fellow Americans, that our country is stronger, safer, and with more jobs because our president has made his every move correct," Voight said.



"Don't be fooled by the political left because we are the people of this nation that is witnessing triumph," he continued. "So let us stand with our president, let us stand for this truth that President Trump is the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln. God bless America, and may God continue to guide this nation."

Voight is one of Hollywood's most outspoken conservative voices. He was also one of Trump's earliest Hollywood supporters, who has continued to support the president more than two years into Trump's first term.

During an inauguration event at the Lincoln Monument in Jan. 2017, Voight said that "God answered all our prayers" with Trump's election.

"And President Lincoln, who sits here with us ... I'm sure is smiling knowing America will be saved by an honest and good man who will work for all the people, no matter their creed or color," Voight said, according to The Hill.

Permeable pavement helps water soak into your property!. Choosing the Right Permeable Hardscape. The first step to creating pavement that is permeable is to choose an option that matches the space given for the project and the budget that is being utilized. Some types of pavement include:. - Permeable pavers, which are similar to traditional stone pavers, but have special gaps filled with small stones that allow water to seep into the ground.. - A plastic or concrete grid system, in which the gaps are filled with gravel or grasses for easy infiltration.. - A porous asphalt, porous pavement (local company!) or pervious concrete, which is a lower cost option, that allows water to flow through final example and a lower cost option.. 1 Comment:. By Odette Iskander 08 Aug 2018. I like the idea of permeable pavement a lot. Unfortunately, I currently live in a condo and can’t exercise that option. I will mention to friends who may be paving.

TMZ has obtained a copy of a defamation lawsuit Stern just filed in L.A. County Superior Court. He claims Hatten -- the sister of Anna Nicole Smith's crazy ex-con ex-boyfriend Mark -- fed lies to Cosby, including the one that Stern gave lip service to Larry B ... in a Paris Hilton kind of way. Cosby's already been sued for publishing the allegation ... et tu, Jackie.. And there's more ... Stern is also suing Mark Speer, the dude Debra Opri hired to bodyguard Birkhead. Larry fired Speer, and Stern claims the scorned heavy then made up lies, which he spoon fed to Cosby. The alleged lies include claims that Stern was stealing money from Anna and striking back door deals with Birkhead over Dannielynn.. Stern is suing Hatten and Speer for unspecified damages.. BTW, Mark Hatten was busted for DUI today.

J. J. Thomson and the Existence of the Electron. On April 30, 1897, English physicist Joseph John Thomson gave the first experimental proof of the electron, which had been already theoretically predicted by Johnstone Stoney. Thomson was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the electron and for his work on the conduction of electricity in gases. Joseph John Thomson was born in 1856 in Manchester, England and was taught mainly in private schools at the beginning. In 1876,…Read more

We just released our new forums!. Either option can be correct depending on your particular situation. I think, for the normal citizen, in a self defense situation, a lazer would be a total waste. More than likely what the person would be doing is pulling their weapon, pointing, and shooting as quickly as possible. Now law enforcement or security guards may have a different perspective on the need for a lazer. To me the normal self defense situation is; up close, sudden, pull your weapon, point and shoot. There isn't going to be any time to take a proper stance and use your sights. If you have not maintained situational awareness, you may not even have time to pull your weapon. Your propbably going to be shooting from positions you've never dreamt of. If I thought any different, I would never carry my S&W Bodyguard .380. Hitting anything, with any other than the first shot, at any distance of ten feet or more with that gun is an adventure to say the least.

Courts consider company advisers, such as investment banks, to be "abettors," making them immune to securities-fraud class actions. But in the Enron case, the investment banks still may be vulnerable. Here's why:. 1. The bankers took stakes in off-balance-sheet partnerships they created that helped Enron hide debt. Plaintiffs will try to prove that they are "instigators" of fraud, not just abettors.. 2. Private partnership documents show that banks knew Enron's finances were shaky, but their underwriting filings on debt issues sold to the public suggest otherwise. Plaintiffs will claim the filings were fraudulent.. 3. Document discovery may produce further embarrassing revelations.. Data: Legal documents, BusinessWeek

I used the filter shown below:. Position of active player exactly 9. Raised Preflop any 2Bet. Raised First in. Players dealt into hand between 3 and 10. I wanted to look at bvb results when I was in the SB vs specific opponents in the BB when I raise first in.. When I run this filter I can look at specific opponent stats - vs a certain opponent it says I won 7 hands and lost 90.. However, when I click on that player and look through all the hands I won 80 hands and lost 90. It's way undercounting my stats. It's also showing (in the top box summary) that I won $200 and lost $2,000, but when I look down at individual hands my amount won is way undercounted.. Am I doing something wrong or is it displaying info incorrectly?

Q:

Safe Home Network through WiFi

Maybe this is such an obvious question that it's a duplicate.
I have Ubuntu 10.10 on both my PC and Laptop. The Laptop connects to the Internet through a WiFi router. The PC connects to the same router with an Ethernet cable.
How can I safely share files between my PC and Laptop through this router? Do I have to change the router's config?
I'll need SSL as the WiFi is open at this moment, but I guess I can find info about that without a problem. Once I've done that, network printing should be easy :)
Edit Updated both to 11.10. Activated DHCP on the router to fix the IP addresses of both computers and the router now uses WPA2. I haven't been able to set up NFS between the computers, but I did achieve a safe FTP server connection.

A:

For this you need sftp
Firstly install ssh on all three computers
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
and find the ip of the computer using these commands:
sudo ifconfig | grep -o "inet addr:[0-9.]*" | cut -d ":" -f 2 | grep -v ^127

On the other computers do so in nautilus:

Click connect and bookmark it like this

Similarly do the same for the other machines use the bookmarks to nagivate the other computers

A:

On each computer install the ssh package.
Then you can mount the filesystem over SFTP (stands for Ssh File Transfer Protocol) in nautilus and copy that way just like you would between drives. To access files on the other computer, open nautilus and Clik the File -> Connect to server... menu. Pick ssh from the menu/list. Put in your username for the other computer and the IP for the other computer and click connect. It should ask for your password for the laptop username you put in and then it should show the files on the laptop. (You can do this in either direction.)
This method encrypts the whole thing both ways so it is safe even over open wifi (or if you use strong passwords) even over the internet. 
You can find out the IP of a computer by running ifconfig on it. It will give you something like this:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:11:11:9e:58:57  
          inet addr:192.168.1.15  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

          RX bytes:348505532 (348.5 MB)  TX bytes:127490351 (127.4 MB)

lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
          RX packets:68246 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:68246 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

          RX bytes:35179159 (35.1 MB)  TX bytes:35179159 (35.1 MB) 

Look for a line that says 'inet addr:192.168.###.###' (that does not start with 127.0.) and that is the IP address. So for the example ifconfig output I listed, it would be 192.168.1.15   This would be the address I would use to connect to the computer I ran ifconfig on.

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) -
Home loan rates rose in anticipation that the Federal Reserve will raise rates sooner, and faster, than many market watchers expect, mortgage financier Freddie Mac said Thursday.

"All eyes will be on the Fed for the next few months at least. How aggressive or how measured the coming rate hikes are will determine the future direction of both short- and long-term mortgage rates," said Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist.

For the week ended June 11, the rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 6.30 percent, with an average 0.7 point payable up front, up slightly from the previous week when it averaged 6.28, according to Freddie Mac.

Last year at this time, the 30-year averaged 5.21 percent.

The 15-year mortgage advanced to 5.67 percent from last week's 5.63 percent, with 0.7 point payable up front. A year ago, it was 4.60 percent.

The one-year adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) averaged 4.14 percent, up from 3.98 percent the previous week, with 0.7 point payable up front. A year earlier it averaged 3.54 percent.

"The 1-year ARM responds more directly to movements by the Fed," said Nothaft. "And market chatter has it that the Fed will not only raise rates at the end of this month, but may do so consecutively throughout the rest of the year."

"News like that is good news for keeping long-term fixed-rate mortgage rates low since those are more sensitive to inflationary expectations."

Freddie Mac's average mortgage rates are based on a survey of 125 lenders nationwide.

Freddie Mac (FRE: up $0.55 to $60.32, Research, Estimates), or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., is a publicly traded company the government established in 1970 to provide a flow of funds to mortgage lenders. It buys mortgages from banks, bundles them and then resells them as mortgage-backed securities.

Its products, and the products of other similar entities, have become popular as an alternative to government-backed bonds, notably with international investors.

Biodegradation of methyl violet by Pseudomonas mendocina MCM B-402.
Pseudomonas mendocina MCM B-402 was found to utilize a triphenylmethane dye, methyl violet as the sole source of carbon when incorporated in synthetic medium. Almost complete decolorization of methyl violet by P. mendocina was observed within 48 h of incubation at ambient temperature (28 +/- 2 degrees C) under aerated culture conditions, when the bacteria were inoculated into Davis Mingioli's synthetic medium at a concentration of 100 mg/l medium. Methyl violet was mineralized to CO2 through three unknown intermediate metabolites and phenol. The decolorization of the dye involved demethylation.

3rd Annual Aggie Wallace Bagpipe Competition

For the third time in many years, there will be a bagpipe competition at this year’s Highland Festival and Games. All pipers whatever ages and playing abilities are invited to come and participate. You will enter the competition at the Festival.

The competition is named for Aggie Wallace who is recognized as the first individual who trained and organized Hawaii residents in the art of playing the bagpipe and organized them into the first local bagpipe band. Aggie came to Hawaii in 1938 on the invitation of E.K. Fernandez who immediately put her to work with his traveling carnival. She was born in Canada, the daughter of a Pipe Major, emigrated to Canada with her family and ended up playing on Vaudeville and in Hollywood where she met E.K. and the rest is history.

Pipers will be judged on their abilities as it relates to the playing of marches, strathspays, and reels and the traditional music of the pipes, piobaireachd.

This competition has been made possible because of generous support from the Celtic Pipes and Drums of Hawaii, the Hawaii Scottish Association and from Kim Greeley, who was a student of Aggie Wallace.

Architecture of Johannesburg

Johannesburg is the capital of the Gauteng province and the financial hub of South Africa. Founded in 1886, the city is located in the Witwatersrand region, which has vast gold deposits. The town experienced rapid growth as the gold deposits were exploited, and is now South Africa's largest urban center. As a result, the Johannesburg area has a wide variety of architecture, from early Art Nouveau to Postmodern buildings. Hillbrow, for example, contains many buildings constructed since the 1950s, including the Hillbrow Tower.

Notable buildings
Johannesburg features a variety of commercial and residential buildings, so there are also a few modern buildings such as the KwaDukuza eGoli Hotel and the Trust Bank Building. The Johannesburg-Pretoria combined metropolitan area has the densest concentration of skyscrapers on the continent and one of the densest in the world.

Carlton Centre is a skyscraper and shopping center located in downtown Johannesburg, South Africa. At 223 meters (730 ft), it is the tallest building in Africa and about half the height of the Willis Tower (the former Sears Tower) in Chicago. It was the tallest building in the southern hemisphere when originally completed. The Carlton Centre has 50 floors and is 223m tall, about 40m short of featuring in the world's top 100 skyscrapers. The foundations of the two buildings in the complex are 3.5m in diameter and extend 20m down to the bedrock, 30m below street level. The building houses both offices and shops and has over 46 percent of the floor area below ground level.[1] A viewing deck on the 50th floor offers views of Johannesburg and Pretoria.
Ponte City Apartments is a skyscraper in the Hillbrow neighborhood of Johannesburg, South Africa. It was built in 1975 to a height of 173 m (567.6 ft), making it the tallest residential skyscraper in Africa. The 54-story building is cylindrical, with an open center allowing additional light into the apartments. The center space is known as "the core" and rises above an uneven rock floor. Ponte City was an extremely desirable address for its views over all of Johannesburg and its surroundings. The sign on top of the building is the highest and largest sign in the southern hemisphere. It currently advertises the South African mobile phone company Vodacom.
Marble Towers is a skyscraper in the Central Business District of Johannesburg, South Africa. It was built in 1973 and is 32 stories tall. The building has an eight-story parking garage attached to it. It has the biggest electronic sign in the Southern Hemisphere, measuring 44 meters by 32 meters by 12 meters. It is made out of a mixture of concrete and marble. Its main use is for commercial offices.
KwaDukuza eGoli Hotel is a skyscraper in the Central Business District of Johannesburg, South Africa. The complex, built in 1970 originally as "The Tollman Towers" (owned by the prominent South African family), were two separate towers, one 40 stories and the other 22, linked by a four-story podium with a pool deck and a running track. The building was empty for many years as the hotel, The Johannesburg Sun, relocated to Sandton. The building was then converted to a Holiday Inn, which also quickly failed. The new KwaDukuza eGoli Hotel opened in 2001 when it hosted 3000 police officers for the world summit on sustainable development, it was owned Mark Whitehead of Whitehead Enterprises, then also soon went out of business. The building is currently "mothballed."
Sandton City is a shopping center located in Sandton, Johannesburg that was built as a pioneer center in 1973. The tower was built as part of a business park for downtown Sandton, a suburb of Johannesburg. Liberty Properties announced in 2008 that Sandton City would receive an R1.77 billion upgrade. Liberty Properties Chief Executive Samuel Ogbo envisaged the complex as South Africa's very own Wall Street The redevelopment will include the construction of a 60-story office tower, new retail and office space and residential apartments. The extension will stretch to 30 000 m2 and the total complex will have a gross lettable area of 158 000 m2.
Trust Bank Building is a skyscraper in the Central Business District of Johannesburg, South Africa. It was built in 1970 to a height of 140 meters. The building is the former head office of Trust Bank of South Africa, and as such has one of the largest bank vaults in South Africa. The building was recently sold in February 2003 for Rand 6.4 million (USD $640.000), which may prompt the name to be changed to that of the new tenant.
11 Diagonal Street is a skyscraper in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was built in 1984 to a height of 80 meters. It is designed to look like a diamond as it reflects different views of the Central Business District from each angle of the building.

Speaking to reporters after Kejriwal announced that the Odd-Even scheme will be back from November 4-15, Gadkari said: "I don't think it is necessary. We have made a new Ring Road, and with that Delhi's pollution has come down a lot. And in my estimate in two years...Rs 50,000 crore has been provided by my department, and the Yamuna Clean Water and Clean Air Scheme are going on, and with that in two years Delhi will be pollution-free.". Gadkari said it is up to the Delhi government to implement the scheme.. Kejriwal said that 1,000 electric buses will be introduced in the national capital and that a bus aggregator policy will be announced soon.. "If you enforce Odd-Even for a long time, the implementation becomes troublesome. As of now, Odd-Even will only be restricted to this time frame," said Kejriwal.. He also asserted that Supreme Court guidelines during Diwali on firecrackers will be sternly enforced. Kejriwal also urged the people of Delhi to take part in tree plantation drives.

Follow Follow

"Follow Follow" is a song sung by supporters of Rangers, a football club in Glasgow, Scotland. It is based upon the revivalist hymn "Follow On".

Club usage
The song has been adopted by Rangers as their club anthem. In 2007 Rangers used the song as an inspiration for the title of their initiative against unacceptable behaviour at football matches, Follow With Pride, to replace their Pride Over Prejudice campaign.  There is also a Rangers fanzine named after the song. It is also called Follow Follow and was banned from being sold outside Ibrox Stadium due to having printed articles with a sectarian related content. It moved to an online message board which is now the leading Rangers fansite.

Controversy 
The song has gathered an amount of controversy after some fans started to sing alternative lyrics about the Pope and the Vatican City that are considered sectarian.

In 1999 Rangers' vice-chairman Donald Findlay had to stand down from his position and resign from the club's board after being filmed singing "Follow Follow" (with these alternative lyrics) and "The Sash". The Faculty of Advocates (the professional body to which Findlay belonged) found his actions were "likely to bring the faculty into disrepute" and fined him £3,500.

In 2009, Linda Gillies was investigated by police after West Lothian Council received a complaint after her parrot was heard whistling "Follow Follow", to the chagrin of some of her neighbours. The complaint was eventually dismissed by the council and no charges were brought against Gillies.

Lyrics
The lyrics are:

Though the straits be broad or narrow, follow we will,
Follow we will, follow we will,
If the straits be broad or narrow, follow we will,
We will follow in the footsteps of our team. [God bless them]
Follow follow, we will follow Rangers,
Everywhere, anywhere,
We will follow on,
Dundee, Hamilton, Aberdeen and back again
If they go to Dublin we will follow on.

For there's not a team like the Glasgow Rangers,
No not one, and there never shall be one,
Celtic know all about their troubles,
We will fight till the day is done.
For there's not a team like the Glasgow Rangers,
No not one, and there never shall be one!

I went to my old friend last Tuesday. She and her husband were my really good friends over the years. Her husband was my hubby's best friend. I miss them so much! i really wanted to tell them everything about what's going on to our lives. I love to talk to them and i admire them so much because they have been together for so many years and they never had any major problems with each other. Until i found out that her husband is having an affair. I'm still thinking if i should tell it right away or should i wait?. in transition. 2 years ago. 2 comments:.

Recommendation Reports

Northeast of Fogal Road and The Gore Road – Council had approved, in principle in June 2014, a proposed development consisting of retail buildings, some of which have already been built. The conditions include gaining access to Region of Peel service. They weren’t able to gain permission by November 2015 and got an extension. However, they have made progress and will be gaining access soon, allowing them to build the rest of the development (page 140)

8863 The Gore Road – final approval of a development in principle, as long as the associated case at the Ontario Municipal Board be dismissed. Development includes 113 single detached units, 161 townhouses, a medium/high density residential block, an employment/office building block, and associated infrastructure like open space, parks, and roads. Original proposal was all residential on employment lands, but has now been shifted to half residential (north side), half offices (south side fronting on Queen Street). It should be noted that the residential apartment/condo building and office developments haven’t actually been designed (page 157).

Abstract

Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) is a non-native invasive tree that is of particular concern in the Southeastern United States. It has become naturalized in a variety of habitats and can be found in monospecific stands. The use of tallow woodlands by overwintering birds is poorly documented. I compared use of tallow woodlands to use of bottomland hardwood forests by birds in the Mermentau River Basin, Louisiana. Species richness and evenness were greater in the bottomland hardwood sites. Three species were more abundant in tallow woodlands, six species were more common in bottomland hardwoods, and six species exhibited no difference between habitats. Information-theory methodology was used to determine the relative importance of woodland type and certain landscape variables to species richness and bird abundance. Model-averaged parameter estimates and relative Akaike weights were calculated. In most cases, woodland type was a better predictor of species richness and abundance than percent forest cover, distance to nearest forest patch, or the number of forest patches within 1 km. Energy assimilation of tallow fruit by captive birds was measured to determine if apparent metabolizable energy differed between bird species and plant species. Assimilation of tallow fruit pulp differed significantly between birds. Yellow-rumped Warblers (Dendroica coronata) exhibited the highest assimilation of tallow, followed by American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and then Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis). Yellow-rumped Warblers, which where more common in the tallow woodlands, were able to metabolize tallow fruit more effectively than wax myrtle (Morella cerifera) and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) fruit. Metabolization of wax myrtle and poison ivy fruit did not differ significantly. Cardinals metabolized deciduous holly fruit (Ilex decidua) more efficiently than either hackberry (Celtis laevigata) or tallow. Overall, bottomland hardwoods supported more bird species and exhibited a higher measure of species evenness. Tallow may provide an alternate food source for some species and could potentially influence the local winter distribution of Yellow-rumped Warblers.

Donate. © AFP 2017/ KIM JAE-HWAN. US President Donald Trump has found a way to thrive on tensions with North Korea.. The US president claimed on Tuesday that the US would allow South Korea and Japan to buy more “highly sophisticated” US military equipment in response to the so-called North Korea threat.. I am allowing Japan & South Korea to buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 5 September 2017. Trump did not reveal what kind of equipment he had in mind. However, the White House said the president was willing to approve the sale of “many billions of dollars’ worth of military weapons and equipment” to South Korea.. Trump’s statement followed North Korea’s six nuclar test that took place on Sunday. The US president also claimed that the US was ready to use its “nuclear capabilities” to defend itself and its allies.. Donate

Jill and I continued our tour around Pit 1 and were able to see more of the warriors that were getting excavated and refurbished.. We didn’t hire a guide, since we were in a rush and didn’t want to bargain.. Yes, everything in China is a bargaining event and it gets very tiring.. Sometimes we just want to pay a fair price and be done with it so we just give up and don’t bother.. Imagine living each day as if you were going into a car dealership and having to bargain for a lot of what you want.. It tends to make us cynical and jaded and we, therefore, don’t have as much interaction as we normally would with others.. So, we skipped the tour guide and I wish we hadn’t because I would have liked to know why they are wrapped in cellophane.. Our guess was they were being glued back together and this allows them to hold until the glue settles but we aren’t sure.. Either way, walking around the back of the exhibit was a wonderful way to end our visit to the Terracotta Army.. This slideshow requires JavaScript.

The present invention relates to electrocatalyst compositions. More specifically, the invention relates to electrocatalysts which can be used on the anode of a fuel cell to oxidize alcohol.
A fuel cell is an electrochemical device with an anode and a cathode that converts chemical energy provided by a fuel and an oxidant into electricity. An electrolyte is required which is in contact with both electrodes and which may be alkaline, acidic, solid or liquid. The basic process is highly efficient and essentially pollution-free. Also, since single fuel cells can be assembled in stacks of varying sizes, systems can be designed to produce a wide range of output levels.
As an energy conversion device, the fuel cell is distinguished from a conventional battery by its fuel storage capacity. Unlike a battery which consumes internally stored fuel and needs to be either discarded or recharged after a certain time, fuel is fed to the fuel cell from an external source giving the fuel cell a practically unlimited storage capacity. Also, the fuel cell is distinguished from a battery in that its electrodes are catalytically active.
Current is generated by reaction on the fuel cell electrode surfaces, which are in contact with an electrolyte. The fuel is oxidized at the anode and gives up electrons to an external electrical load. The oxidant accepts electrons and is reduced at the cathode. Ionic current through an electrolyte completes the circuit.
In many fuel cell systems, a hydrogen fuel is produced by converting a hydrocarbon-based fuel such as methane, or an oxygenated hydrocarbon fuel such as methanol, to hydrogen in a process called reforming. This reformate fuel contains, in addition to hydrogen, high levels of carbon dioxide; usually around 25%. The reformate fuel also contains small amounts of impurities, such as carbon monoxide, typically at levels of around 1%.
Other fuel cells, called "direct" or "non-reformed" fuel cells oxidize fuel high in hydrogen content directly, without the hydrogen first being separated by a reforming process. It has been known since the 1950s that lower primary alcohols, particularly the C1-C5 alcohols, can be oxidized directly (i.e., without reformation to H.sub.2 +CO or H.sub.2 +CO.sub.2) at the anode of a fuel cell. Methanol and ethanol are particularly useful.
Because compactness is critical to the commercial viability of utilizing a fuel cell as an energy source in such items as electric automobiles, the ability to oxidize alcohol as a fuel directly without having to also utilize a reformer is important. Serious drawbacks have also been encountered in the storage of hydrogen for use in fuel cells. Thus, a "direct" fuel cell, such as a methanol fuel cell, is advantageous in that it is compact and no energy is used up in reformation. Further, the fuel is easily stored in liquid form, is high in hydrogen content, is highly reactive in a fuel cell, and is economically viable.
In a typical methanol fuel cell, methanol is oxidized to produce electricity, heat, water, and carbon dioxide. The goal in methanol fuel processing is complete methanol oxidation for maximum energy generation shown in the equation: EQU Anode: CH.sub.3 OH+H.sub.2 O.fwdarw.CO.sub.2 +6H.sup.+ +6e.sup.- EQU Cathode: O.sub.2 +4e+4H.sup.+.fwdarw.2H.sub.2 O (1) EQU Net: 2CH.sub.3 OH+3O.sub.2.fwdarw.4H.sub.2 O+CO.sub.2.
In the absence of an electrocatalyst, a typical electrode reaction occurs, if at all, only at very high overpotentials. Thus, the oxidation and reduction reactions require catalysts in order to proceed at useful rates. Catalysts that promote the rates of electrochemical reactions, such as oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation in a fuel cell are often referred to as electrocatalysts. Electrocatalysts are important because the energy efficiency of any cell is determined, in part, by the overpotentials necessary at the cell's anode and cathode.
Platinum (Pt), an expensive metal, is the best catalyst for many electrochemical reactions, including methanol oxidation. A major obstacle in the development of methanol fuel cells is the loss of electrochemical activity of even the best electrocatalyst due to "poisoning" by carbon monoxide (CO). CO is an intermediate in the oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2). The CO molecule is strongly adsorbed on the electroactive surface of the electrode, obstructing the oxidation of new fuel molecules. It is well known that CO, even at levels of 1-10 ppm, is a severe poison to platinum electrocatalysts and significantly reduces fuel cell performance.
Various attempts have been made to find a solution to the CO poisoning problem. For example, Reddy et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,132,193 discloses the use of gold crystals for the oxidation of alcohol. Yepez, U.S. Pat. No. 5,804,325, discloses the use of deliberately occluded hydrogen in the anode to chemisorb the poisons. Various combinations of metals have also been employed as an electrocatalyst material in an attempt to avoid or minimize the CO poisoning problem. For example, Ma et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,836 discloses an electrocatalyst obtained by combining platinum oxides and iron oxides to form Pt/Fe particles in a colloidal solution.
In spite of the foregoing, prior attempts to solve the problem of CO poisoning at the anode of methanol fuel cells have been unsuccessful. Prior attempts to avoid the problem have proven to be too expensive, ineffective, or impractical to be commercially viable. Thus, there remains a need for electrocatalysts that are resistant to CO poisoning and can be used on the anode for alcohol oxidation in fuel cells.

Fremantle Kids & Family Entertainment, a division of FremantleMedia Enterprises, hopes to build upon the success that "Tree Fu Tom" experienced during its first year in the U.K. The highly rated preschool series, which airs on CBeebies and is a co-production with the BBC channel, debuted in mid-April in the U.S. on the Sprout network.

According to Bob Higgins, executive vice president, Fremantle Kids & Family Entertainment, the strategy is to aggressively develop and establish Tree Fu Tom in the marketplace as a true global preschool property. Higgins believes that the series has all of the elements to accomplish this goal, from an incredible story line to high-quality animation to an extensive consumer products program that launched earlier this year in the U.K. and will eventually make its way to the U.S. in the fall.

"We wanted each episode to feel like a mini-movie, which I think we have succeeded in doing," says Higgins. "We have that cinematic feel in a preschool show, and that is what is now clicking with the audience who are so used to watching high-quality movies. Today's kids are very sophisticated, and you do not have to dumb it down."

Fremantle is aggressively selling the preschool educational series internationally with several major deals in more than a dozen countries including France (Lagardere), Australia/New Zealand (Disney), Israel (HopTV), Eastern Europe (Minimax), Korea (EBS), Brunei (RTB) and throughout Latin America (Discovery Kids). The series has already been sold to Italy (Switchover Media), Canada (Knowledge Network/BBC Kids), Norway (NRK), Belgium (VRT-Ketnet) and Finland (YLE).

Tree Fu Tom is unquestionably a cornerstone of FME's Kids & Family Entertainment group, which was formed three years ago when Higgins, along with Sander Schwartz, president of the division, were recruited to establish the company as a global player in kids' entertainment.

FME recently signed a five-year partnership agreement with BBC to develop additional children's TV shows, which is clearly reflective of the Kids & Family Entertainment division's commitment to global expansion.

From the time Fremantle partnered with BBC to co-produce the series two years ago, all of the pieces of the program development and broadcast launch quickly fell into place.

"We brought in new writers, a new design style and we kept the essence of bringing magic into kids' homes and allowing them to participate in the show and the basic idea of this character's adventures going into a fantasy world."

"Tree Fu Tom's" educational, interactive story line, which is targeted to 4- to 6-year-olds, is based on the magical superhero, Tom, and his best friend Twigs, plus a host of other characters and creatures in a fantasy world called Treetopolis. Blue Zoo Animation does the CGI animation.

"The magic–'tree fu'–is kind of like kung fu, with a movement and chant that goes along with it, which is what happens when Tom does his magic," explains Higgins. "We are trying to get kids up off the couch and doing the spells along with him because when the story hits a certain point for Tom to handle alone, he asks the audience for help. It's all about focusing on kids fine motor skills."

"While the skew is for boys, the ratings show it is very close to being a boy/girl thing," says Higgins. "We have a very strong female character, Ariela, and the queen of Treetopolis is a strong female character, as well."

A comprehensive licensing program was developed in the U.K. and is being developed similarly in the U.S. Giochi Preziosi is master toy licensee for the U.K. and Europe; Random House for publishing; Ravensburger for puzzles; MV Sports for scooters and wheeled toys; Flair for arts and crafts; VMC for accessories; Gemma for greeting cards and party; Egmont for annuals; Rainbow Productions for costumes; Blues Clothing for t-shirts; TDP for nightwear/underwear; and Character World is signed on for bedding.

"We have a certain number of things that have strong sales track records," points out Higgins. "At Licensing Expo, there will be a huge push for consumer products, so we are hopeful it will be the same type of timing that it has been in the U.K. We want to build up demand."

The second series of 26 episodes is now in production and will debut later this year, says Higgins, and a holiday special is also being planned.

In addition, Higgins says live entertainment, and perhaps theatrical, is also being evaluated. In the U.K., Fremantle already has a costume Tom character that goes to different stores and retailers.

"Because of the vibrant world Tom goes into, we can create that fantasy land on stage," he says, adding, "In terms of film, that would be a great opportunity."

In the challenging kids' marketplace, the Tree Fu Tom property is gaining momentum and working its magic to emerge as a bona fide global preschool brand.

Use of the ultrasonic cavitation in wool dyeing process: Effect of the dye-bath temperature.
The present work aims to study the effect of the liquid temperature on the performance of ultrasounds (US) in a dyeing process. The approach was both theoretical and experimental. In the theoretical part the simplified model of a single bubble implosion is used to demonstrate that the "maximum implosion pressure" calculated with the well known Rayleigh-Plesset equation for a single bubble can be correlated with the cavitation intensity experimentally measured with an Ultrasonic Energy Meter (by PPB Megasonics). In particular the model was used to study the influence of the fluid temperature on the cavitation intensity. The "relative" theoretical data calculated from the implosion pressure were satisfactorily correlated with the experimental ones and evidence a zone, between 50 and 60°C, were the cavitation intensity is almost constant and still sufficiently high. Hence an experimental part of wool dyeing was carried out both to validate the previous results and to verify the dyeing quality at low temperatures (40-70°C) in presence of US. A prototype dyeing equipment able to treat textile samples with US system of 600W power, was used. The dyeing performances in the presence and absence of US were verified by measuring ΔE (colour variation), Re,% (reflectance percentage), K/S (colour strength) and colour fastness. The US tests performed in the temperature range of 40-70°C were compared with the conventional wool dyeing at 98°C. The obtained results show that a temperature close to 60°C should be chosen as the recommended US dyeing condition, being a compromise between the cavitation intensity and the kinetics which rules the dyestuff diffusion within the fibres.

Q:

Storing dynamic data in NoSQL

I have scenario where I need to store unstructured data but the rest of my data is structured and relational. An example of the type of unstructured data is as explained below:
User Type 1:

How do you blah blah : 5 fields

User Type 2 :

How do you blah blah : 3 fields

User Type 3 :

How do you blah blah : 7 fields

All 3 types are asked the same question "How do you blah blah" but each user type answers it using different number of fields. And there can be a lot of different user types.
For the relational data, I'm using MySQL but i'm a little confused on how to store this unstructured data:

Serialize as JSON and store in MySQL
Use NoSQL

My requirements are high reads, average updates, average inserts & no deletes. No JOINS needed. I need guaranteed writes & high availability. If I were to choose a NoSQL, it'd be a AP type according to the CAP theorem. I won't be hitting millions of records anytime soon. 
I also plan to provide a text search for this data in the future, but it doesn't need to be a real time search, so I can always index the data using Lucene periodically. But of course, document based NoSQL implementations do provide this out of the box. But I have read in a few places where people have advised against storing JSON data in MySQL. But adding a NoSQL layer could be overkill. 
What do I do & if you do advise me to go for NoSQL DB, which one should I choose?

A:

I'll answer your question in an orthodox manner, with a twist of heresy:
Orthodoxy: You shouldn't store data in a column in a relational database that isn't "atomic."
Heresy: In your specific situation, you could -- maybe -- consider this blob of JSON to be an atomic object.
Years ago, Chris Date said it like this:

"A relation is said to be in first normal form (abbreviated 1NF) if and only if it satisfies the condition that it contains scalar values only"
 Date, C.J. An Introduction to Database Systems, 6th edition (Addison-Wesley, 1995)

Later, he took a somewhat softer stance:

"1NF just means each tuple in the relation contains exactly one value, of the appropriate type, for each attribute. Observe in particular that 1NF places no limitations on what those attribute types are allowed to be."
Date, C. J. Database Design and Relational Theory: Normal Forms and All That Jazz (OReilly Media, 2012)

The "exactly one value" I'm arguing for here is "exactly one JSON object" (which could, in turn contain a JSON array).
Storing things in JSON in a column is a bad idea if you need to the DBMS to manipulate it in any way, since, of course, it can't be properly indexed like properly normalized data can be... but, arguably, if you really really really don't intend for the DBMS to do anything with what you're storing other than write and read it, the case could be made to store a chunk of JSON in a single column, claiming the JSON array of values to be a single atomic value.
The big objection, I think, to doing this, is when it's done out of a lack of familiarity with the relational model or out of laziness or naivete.  Obviously, there are a lot of ways it could be done wrong, but I'd suggest that there's nothing inherently wrong about storing a chunk of JSON in a database, As Long As You Know What You're Doing.™
And, of course, you could use a MySQL FULLTEXT index on it, now that those are supported in InnoDB as of (MySQL 5.6).



Shlomo Havlin

Shlomo Havlin (born July 21, 1942) is a Professor in the Department of Physics at Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel. He served as President of the Israel Physical Society (1996–1999), Dean of Faculty of Exact Sciences (1999–2001), Chairman, Department of Physics (1984–1988).

In 2018 he won the Israel Prize for his accomplishments in physics.

Biography

Professor Shlomo Havlin was born in Jerusalem, Israel (then part of The British Mandate of Palestine). He graduated from Bar-Ilan and Tel-Aviv Universities with Highest Distinction. He obtained an academic position at Bar-Ilan University in 1972 where he became a full Professor in Physics at 1984. During 1978–1979 he was a Royal Society Visiting Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, where he worked with Professors William Cochran and Roger Cowley. In 1984 he became the Chair of the Physics Department at Bar-Ilan University until 1988. During 1983–1984 and 1989–1991, Professor Havlin was a Visiting Scientist at NIH where he collaborated much with Drs. George Weiss, Ralph Nossal and other members of NIH. During 1984–1985 and 1991–1992 he was a Visiting Professor at Boston University, where he collaborated with Professor H. Eugene Stanley  and many others. Between  2016 and 2019 Havlin was  a visiting Professor in Tokyo Institute of Technology, where he collaborated with Profs. Misako and Hideki Takayasu.

Centers and research impact
Professor Havlin established four Centers at Bar-Ilan, the Gonda-Goldschmiedt Medical Diagnostic Research Center (1994), the Minerva Center for Mesoscopics, Fractals and Neural Networks (1998), Science Beyond 2000 – Science Education Unit (1996) and Israel Science Foundation National Center for Complex Networks (2003). He was the President of the Israel Physical Society (1996–1999) and the Dean of the Faculty of Exact Sciences at Bar-Ilan University (1999–2001). Professor Havlin had more than 200 graduate students and postdocs, and collaborated with more than 400 scientists around the globe. He published more than 700 articles and 11 books. He was in 2018 one of the two most cited Israel scientists. He is currently in the editorial board of several scientific journals: Fractals, Physica A, New Journal of Physics, Research Letters in Physics and co-editor of Europhysics Letters.

Prizes and awards

Professor Havlin obtained numerous prizes for his outstanding research, including the Landau Prize for Outstanding Research in Physics (1988), the Humboldt Award – Germany (1992), Prize for best scientific paper of 2000, Bar-Ilan University (2000) and Prize for best popular scientific paper Minister of Science, Israel (2002). He also obtained the Nicholson Medal of the American Physical Society (2006), the Chaim Weizmann Prize for Exact Sciences (2009), the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize for outstanding contribution in physics (2010), the Rothschild Prize for Physical and Chemical Sciences (2014), an Honorary Professor, Beihang University, Beijing, China (2016), the Distinguished Scientist Award, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2017), the Order of the Star of Italy, President of Italy (2017) and the Israel Prize for Physics and Chemistry (2018).

Professor Havlin made many important contributions to science. The following are descriptions of his main contributions in randomness and complexity.

Main contributions
Disordered systems that are self-similar on a broad range of length scales are ubiquitous and often modeled by percolation-type models. The laws that describe transport processes or chemical reactions in these systems are significantly different from those in homogeneous systems. The earlier works of Prof. Havlin, where he discovered several of these important anomalies, had an enormous impact on the development of the whole field and are summarized in the monograph “Diffusion and Reactions in Fractals and Disordered Systems” that he wrote together with his former graduate student Daniel ben-Avraham (Cambridge University Press, 2000). The book describes the anomalous physical laws discovered during 1980-2000 in fractals and disordered systems, many of them by Prof. Havlin and his collaborators. His review article (Adv. in Phys. (1987)) was cited more than 1100 times and was chosen by the journal's editors to be published again (Adv. in Phys. (2002)).
In 2000, Professor Shlomo Havlin and his student Reuven Cohen, together with Prof. Daniel ben-Avraham developed a novel percolation-type approach and derived the first theory on the stability of realistic complex networks such as the Internet under random breakdown (Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 4626 (2000)) and intentional attacks (Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 3682 (2001)). This study is particularly useful for optimizing the stability of networks against intentional attacks and viruses. They also derived a novel result about the “small world” nature of complex networks and found that the diameter of scale free networks is significantly smaller and therefore called them “ultrasmall worlds” (Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 58701 (2003)). Since 2010, Havlin and collaborators have focused heavily on interdependent networks. His paper with collaborators developed the percolation theory of network of networks (Nature, 464, 08932 (2010)) and initiated the current active research field of networks of networks. In 2014, he introduced with collaborators  the concept of recovery in percolation theory (Nature Physics,10, 3438 (2014); Nature Comm., 2016).

Going forward, one of the things I am going to be concentrating more on is Detroit’s neighborhoods. The places where the people actually live. I think many of these images may be predictable, but as we go through the city I think many people will be surprised at the diversity and in some instances affluence of Detroit’s great neighborhoods. This post is just a smattering from the East Side, but it is a good example of what I am talking about – clapboard two family dwellings surrounding palatial gated communities and high rise apartments. But was it always like this ? Yep, going back a a hundred years or so. My grandparents raised their family in one of these type of houses, in one of these neighborhoods. My father was born in a lower flat that my grandfather rented from family friends. A couple blocks away were several large mansions, and a gated community..

Everything that comes after , game mechanics , history and synergy between graphics and gameplay holds my attention. So i think you just can't analyze a game by separated aspects since they merge one with the other.[/QUOTE]. This.. What is the first thing you see, when you start playing a game? The graphics, of course. They get your attention and give you a first impression of what to expect. Then it's up to the gameplay to hold your attention and keep you interested.. Overall, both are needed and must be balanced carefully. If either of them are lacking the game as a whole will lose appeal. But as long as the gameplay is fun and understandable, and the graphics are coherent and consistent, then the result will be a reasonably well made game.. Also, other factors like audio, level design, story and that sort of stuff factor in just as much as gameplay and art, but this thread's only asking about those two.

Maritime Ops: Overcoming high freeboard

When making a climb, sometimes all you have is a boat

By Phillip Null

The first and most critical issue to address in any ship boarding or interdiction is how to get a team on board, a planning concern primarily decided by the freeboard of the vessel.

Freeboard is the height between a ship’s deck and its waterline, or the distance from the water to the rail. On small boats it is low and poses no obstacle to a boarding team that only needs to step across from their own boat to board. On larger vessels and commercial ships the height is significantly increased and can only be overcome from the surface by climbing.

Compliant boats will drop a Jacob’s ladder or make similar accommodations for a team to get on, but an unwilling or hostile crew can’t be expected to do the same. There are only a few methods available to make this climb, and though fast roping from helicopters gets boots on deck quicker and in more intimidating fashion, sometimes all you have is a boat.

Use What’s Available
Everyone has seen photo or video of U.S. Navy SEALS climbing chain to board an anchored ship, a tactic that illustrates the first technique teams should consider. If there is already a ladder over the side and it’s tactically prudent, use it. If capable climbers are involved an anchor chain could provide a viable substitute to a hanging ladder, but remember that once on board the team will be at a disadvantage in most cases as they have to maneuver across an open deck from the bow where the anchor deploys to the accommodation and engineering spaces where the vessel’s controls and most of her crew will be. The chain also won’t be available if the ship’s moving, and even if the anchor is set and the ship is stationary, the climb is going to be awkward and slippery.

Climbing Rope
A rope with a grapnel hook tied to its end could be used for some medium freeboard vessels, but by the time climbers make it up they should expect to be fatigued. If carrying a lot of equipment it only gets worse. Knots can alleviate some of the physical strength needed, but safety concerns persist as there is no solid point to clip in if a fall becomes imminent. Ascenders, particularly the kind with power, are available and will make the job easier, but they require additional training and equipment. Their use also limits the number of simultaneous climbers to the number of lines and ascenders available, a factor that could seriously delay embarkation.

Fixed Ladders
The marine boarding ladder, a favorite of Somali pirates, is the best method for medium freeboard heights in the ten feet or less range. Anything higher and they won’t be able to reach. The best of these are fitted with top hooks that slide over a ship’s handrails or kick plates to keep them secure. Teams lift the ladder onto a hook point, test with a pull, then climb up using rungs spaced between the uprights. More narrow pole ladders are also available, and unlike traditional ladders have their rungs leading away from a single pole rather than suspended between two. Many models are collapsible to allow easy transport and storage and some are also buoyant, preventing those nightmare scenarios where the only way onto a target sank after someone dropped it over the side.

Caving Ladder
These are flexible ladders made of two high strength cables with metal rungs spaced between. Used for highest freeboard embarkations, they come at a standard length of 32 feet, but can be custom made to extend even higher. To set them a hook is attached to the top of the ladder then a telescoping (painter’s) pole is used to raise it up to the deck and secure. These can accommodate multiple climbers at one time, but it’s not recommend until the first climber shores up the hook point with a safety runner to prevent the weight and movement from dropping the hook.

Because the painter’s pole must be extended and locked into place and the ladder and hook must be connected, the setup process can cause delays. Several companies have addressed this issue, including ResQmax which offers the VerTmax Pole, an upgrade on the original telescoping design that uses compressed air to raise and lower for faster employment. They also have a line throwing gun that can deploy climbing ropes up to 100 ft and the weight of a ladder up to 50 feet. Another model from Henriksen uses a mechanical winch similar to a fishing reel to speed extension. A top choice for caving ladders and associated equipment is Yates, a popular climbing and weight handling manufacturer with a record for quality and in stock specialty tactical equipment. The last place you need this kind of hardware to fail is miles from land and 30 feet up the side of a ship.

Opposition
Whenever discussing a high freeboard boarding the question comes up of what to do if the opposition starts trying to release or cut the ladder, rope, etc or otherwise impedes the embarkation from their elevated position on deck. Simple answer is that the bad guys are not only trying to prevent the boarding, but at this point trying to kill officers by forcing their fall. Do whatever’s needed to protect yourself and your team. One way to avoid the interference entirely is to choose the hook or embarkation point wisely. Find a spot those on board aren’t covering or won’t expect and climb on quick with solid cover backing the ascent.

Summary
As discussed there are only a handful of options for overcoming high freeboard from the water’s surface. The final decision on which method a team chooses will be based on the target vessel’s construction, the physical ability of the involved officers, and the amount of gear they need to carry on board. Ladders will take a lot of the physical effort out of the equation, but unless they’re a fixed model will require more hardware like a telescoping pole or launcher to get into action. Regardless the method, good luck and hold on tight. Remember the climb is only the first step — someone will be waiting at the top.

Here's a bit of news that might make you drop that chicken nugget midbite.

Just before the start of the long holiday weekend last Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture quietly announced that it was ending a ban on processed chicken imports from China. The kicker: These products can now be sold in the U.S. without a country-of-origin label.

For starters, just four Chinese processing plants will be allowed to export cooked chicken products to the U.S., as first reported by Politico. The plants in question passed USDA inspection in March. Initially, these processors will only be allowed to export chicken products made from birds that were raised in the U.S. and Canada. Because of that, the poultry processors won't be required to have a USDA inspector on site, as The New York Timesnotes, adding:

"And because the poultry will be processed, it will not require country-of-origin labeling. Nor will consumers eating chicken noodle soup from a can or chicken nuggets in a fast-food restaurant know if the chicken came from Chinese processing plants."

That's a pretty disturbing thought for anyone who's followed the slew of stories regarding food safety failures in China in recent years. As we've previously reported on The Salt, this year alone, thousands of dead pigs turned up in the waters of Shanghai, rat meat was passed off as mutton and — perhaps most disconcerting for U.S. consumers — there was an outbreak of the H7N9 bird flu virus among live fowl in fresh meat markets.

What's more, critics fear that the changes could eventually open the floodgates for a whole slew of chicken products from China. As the industry publication World Poultry notes:

"It is thought ... that the government would eventually expand the rules, so that chickens and turkeys bred in China could end up in the American market. Experts suggest that this could be the first step towards allowing China to export its own domestic chickens to the U.S."

The USDA's decision comes with a backdrop of long-running trade disputes over meat between the U.S. and China. In a nutshell: China banned U.S. beef exports in 2003 after a case of mad cow disease turned up in a Washington state cow. Then, when the bird flu virus broke out widely among Asian bird flocks in 2004, the U.S. blocked imports of Chinese poultry. China challenged that decision in front of the World Trade Organization, which ruled in China's favor in 2010.

And, chicken lovers, brace yourselves: There's more. A report suggests chicken inspections here in the U.S. might be poised to take a turn for the worse. The Government Accountability Office said this week it has serious "questions about the validity" of the new procedures for inspecting poultry across the country.

Basically, these changes would replace many USDA inspectors on chicken processing lines with employees from the poultry companies themselves. The USDA has been piloting the new procedures, which will save money and significantly speed up processing lines, in 29 chicken plants. As The Washington Postreports, the plan is to roll out the new procedures eventually to "most of the country's 239 chicken and 96 turkey plants."

The problem? According to the GAO, the USDA did a poor job of evaluating the effectiveness of the pilot programs it has in place.

As a result, the report concludes, it's hard to justify the USDA's conclusions that the new procedures will do a better job than current approaches at cutting down on the number of dangerous bacteria like salmonella that pop up on the birds that will later end up on our dinner tables.

Still, the USDA maintains that the changes will, in fact, boost food safety. In a commentary published on Food Safety News, USDA food safety and inspections administrator Alfred Almanza writes, "If finalized and implemented broadly, this new inspection system would enable [USDA inspectors] to better fulfill our food safety mission. Nothing in the GAO's report contradicts this basic fact."

Challenges to developing countries after joining WTO: risk assessment of chemicals in food.
FAO/WHO encourages member countries to develop national food control measures based on risk assessment in order to assure proper protection level to consumers and facilitate fair trade. This is particularly important for developing countries as WTO members because it is clearly stated in the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) Agreement that: (a) SPS measures should be based on risk assessment techniques developed by relevant international organizations; and (b) Codex standards which is based on risk assessment are regarded as the international norm in trade dispute settlement. When conducting risk assessment on food chemicals (including additives and contaminants) in developing countries, in most cases it is not necessary to conduct their own hazard characterization because the ADIs or PTWIs of food chemicals developed by international expert groups (e.g. JECFA) are universally applicable and also developing countries do not have the resources to repeat those expensive toxicological studies. On the other hand, it is necessary to conduct exposure assessment in developing countries because exposure to food chemicals varies from country to country. This is not only crucial in setting national standards, but also very important for developing countries to participate in the process of developing Codex standards. In addition to food standard development, risk assessment is also useful in setting up priorities in imported food inspection and evaluating the success of various food safety control measures.

BT believes this is the year it claims British sport

Marc Watson chats Premier League, 4K and British tech

2013 is the year that BT goes all in. Come August it will go head to head with Sky by launching its own rival sports service, BT Sport, offering 38 exclusive live football matches from the Barclays Premier League and a tonne of other sports available across its two channels. It's a market that has long been dominated by Sky, but BT has its own unique kicker - the service is free for its Broadband customers.

And despite both Setanta's and (before it was bought by BT) ESPN's previous failed attempts to break Sky's stronghold, there's an air of confidence about Marc Watson, chief executive of TV at BT Retail. "We're feeling very optimistic," he tells us. "We think there's a really big opportunity to expand the market."

He even bats away suggestions that Sky's retaliations, including offering its first free-to-air live Premiership League match on the first day of the season, are a cause for concern. "We think it's a really good endorsement of the model we've developed and we think it's a positive," he says.

"I think it's great. I think they should do more free actually. I think it's a model the customers like and we'd encourage them to roll that model out across more of their products."

BT's plan is to bring in the masses by waving the "free" banner although you'll need to be an existing BT Broadband customer to enjoy the service charge-free (and pay £3 a month for HD if you sign up after August 1). Those with Sky broadband, meanwhile, can get BT Sport for £15 a month in HD or £12 a month for standard, with a one-off activation fee of £15.

"What I'm hoping it will do is bring more customers into the market who want to watch this sport. Sky is doing one day for free. If [customers] want to watch this kind of sport going forward then there's only one company that's free all the time and that's us," says Watson.

"Only one in five households in the UK take premium sports at the moment," he adds. "And that's not because only one in five households are interested in sports, but because only one in five households can afford the premium sport that's been out there so far."

Vantage point

It's been by standing on the sidelines that BT has been able to plot its attack on the market, and now it's ready to strike. But the proof will be in the BT pudding. Although it's keeping cagey on the numbers right now, Watson is able to tell us that they're "very pleased with the progress so far" in terms of uptake for the service.

Still, Watson agrees that it remains a challenging market. "And the regulation of the UK market is very unbalanced," he adds. But BT's vision is long term, and goes well beyond the two channels it will be offering from August.

"The main difference is that [ESPN and Setanta] only had one product to sell which was the channel," he says. "We're a big business with a bulk of products to sell to customers. And the reason we're interested in sport is because we think it can help us sell our range of products to customers."

Watson is confident that BT has the upper hand

BT believes that it can use its sports service to demonstrate the power of its superfast broadband. "There's a lot of money - £3 billion almost - rolling out for superfast broadband around the UK," says Watson.

"The fastest superfast broadband anywhere in the world. That's a network that's primed and ready to go. And one of the things we can use sport for is to showcase that network. We'll be looking at features and ideas and innovations that help us to do that."

TV StandsStands & Brackets

There is something special about good music, and for some people hearing it at home on a good audio system is a relaxing pastime. The typical midi all-in-one system delivers well in a dorm room or a bedroom, but struggles to fill a good sized living room. This is where a decent separates audio system comes into its own.

Why a Hi-Fi Separates System?
A Separates Hi-Fi system typically has signal sources (CD player, tuner, Ipod interface) as separate devices. This goes into the preamplifier, which allows source selection and volume, balance and tone controls if necessary, then into a separate power amplifier. Alternatively, an integrated amplifier containing preamplifier and power amplifier in one box can be used for more modest systems.

Since the components are standalone units, this offers the opportunity to mix and match units from different manufacturers. This has the advantage of flexibility - a company that makes great CD players, for instance, may not make the best power amplifiers. It allows the buyer to spend money on just the components they will use - no need to get a radio tuner if it will never be used.

Hawai'i Pineapple Co. operates a farm on the Big Island, but most of its production comes from a partnership with Aloun Farm, in Kunia.

1993: Dole tears down its pineapple water tower after closing the cannery in '92.

1983: Del Monte ceases Hawai'i pineapple canning operations.

1968: Canning on Lana'i. Pineapple production starting to slow.

Pineapple farming in Hawai'i declined sharply in the past few years at the hands of two agribusiness industry giants, but increasing numbers of small farmers see sweet opportunity in the crop long associated with the Isles.

"Call us crazy, but let's hope we're crazy like a fox — not crazy crazy," said Craig Bowden, a farm industry veteran who partnered to start two local pineapple farm ventures three years ago and has rapidly expanded.

Bowden was one of 42 pineapple growers in the state in 2007, up from 34 in 2002 and 27 in 1997, according to the three most recent farm census reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The rise in pineapple farming involves mostly small farms, so the crop isn't about to reclaim its crown as king of Hawai'i agriculture — a title lost in 2006 to seed crops.

But the niche growth for pineapple is helping maintain agriculture's roots in Hawai'i and counters a perception for some that pineapple farming is dying out in the state.

"It's part of Hawai'i," said Mark Hudson, statistician for the state Department of Agriculture.

Plantation-scale pineapple farming in Hawai'i has suffered over several decades from competition largely from Central America and Asia where land and labor costs are cheaper. Hawai'i's pineapple production by acreage actually peaked in 1955, though the value of annual pineapple sales topped out in 1991 at $108 million.

CUTBACKS SEEN

The most recent pullbacks involved Del Monte Fresh Produce leaving the local market in 2006, and a cutback last year by Maui Land & Pineapple Co. from roughly 2,000 acres to 1,000 acres. Dole Food Co. reduced its local pineapple business in 2006 from 3,100 acres to 2,700, and remains the biggest grower in the state.

Matthew Loke, agriculture development division administrator with the state Department of Agriculture, said Hawai'i farms still supply 100 percent of pineapple for local consumption, but the changes by big producers have created opportunity for more small farmers, especially organic producers and growers of special varieties.

New growth in local pineapple farming has mostly involved very small farms, according to census figures. On the Big Island, 19 pineapple farms averaged one acre in size. On Kaua'i, 16 acres of pineapple were spread over 13 farms.

Those in the industry suspect that some of the small farms counted in the census don't produce fresh fruit for commercial sale, or may only sell at farmers markets.

Bowden is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, among the new crop of Hawai'i pineapple farmers. A graduate of Kalani High School and former manager with Del Monte who worked in the Philippines, Hawai'i and Florida, Bowden partnered with fellow Kalani alumnus and crop research specialist Tom Menezes to start Hawai'i Pineapple Co. LLC in 2006 and produce fruit under a brand named Hawaiian Crown.

The company started with a few acres of its own pineapple variety sold in Times Super Market, and has since dramatically expanded by tens of acres and added more retail outlets including Foodland Super Market, KTA Super Stores and military commissaries.

GROWTH ON BIG ISLAND

Hawai'i Pineapple Co. operates a farm on the Big Island, but most of its production comes from a partnership with large diversified crop grower Aloun Farm in Kunia on O'ahu.

Bowden said 99 percent of Hawaiian Crown pineapple is sold locally in stores typically for $1.59 to $1.79 a pound, with a few exports to places such as California, Las Vegas and even Dubai.

Bowden said plans are in the works to partner with two more existing farms on O'ahu and the Big Island that would double the size of the business.

On a smaller scale, Sweet Spirit Farms on the Big Island incorporated pineapple farming with a Kona coffee farm started in 2004 by Deb and Paul Sims after they moved to Hawai'i from the Mainland in 2003.

Deb Sims said they started planting crowns from white pineapple they bought to eat, and two years ago had accumulated enough plants to begin selling regularly at the local farmers market where the fruit typically sells for $3 a pound.

"They're easy to grow," she said. "They don't need a lot of care."

Sweet Spirit, which has about 3,600 coffee trees, has about 250 pineapple plants on one-fourth an acre, and Sims said she and her husband intend to plant more. "The supply I don't think meets the demand," she said.

Other small pineapple farmers include Phil Green, who grows organic pineapples on Kaua'i at Kaua'i Organic Farms, and James Bunten and Sharon Umbaugh of Bunten Farms who grow white pineapples on the Big Island.

The growth among small pineapple farmers, however, doesn't mean the business is easy or a sure thing. Small farmers have left the business in recent years, a reminder that farming is inherently tough with its exposure to inclement weather, pests and other factors that are hard to control.

PERSONAL PRODUCTION

On Lana'i — once the world's largest pineapple plantation operated by Dole Food — only one commercial farmer is believed to be growing pineapple, but the plants aren't for commercial production.

Alberta De Jetley farms 18 acres planted in a variety of crops, including lettuce and bananas, sold to the island's two resorts and other local businesses. De Jetley said she first planted pineapple for fun about 18 months ago with about 20 plants, and has since more than doubled plantings of crowns she receives from a hotel bakery.

Still, De Jetley, who once contemplated asking Dole for propagation material for 200 plants, intends to keep her pineapple harvests small for sharing with friends and making what she said is a fantastic fruit salad.

She is stepping up to the plate.

Credit: Instagram / @chrissyteigen; @maroney_mckayla

Chrissy Teigen is one celebrity, mother, model, and television personality who loves to speak her mind. If she has something she wants to say, she’ll say it. And apparently, she wants others to do the same.

Chrissy, along with a host of other celebrities including actress Kristen Bell, have recently declared that they are willing to pay McKayla Maroney’s $100,000 fine if she speaks up against alleged abused Larry Nassar in court.

McKayla said back in October that Larry Nassar sexually abused her for years. It all started when she was just 13 years old! Nassar faces similar accusations from dozens of athletes, including by U.S. gymnasts Gabby Douglas, Maggie Nichols, Simone Biles and Aly Raisman.

Here’s the problem though: McKayla reached a settlement over her claims and faces a $100,000 fine if she speaks at Larry Nassar’s hearing. One hundred twenty-five women and girls have filed civil lawsuits against Nassar. That’s why Chrissy and other female celebrities are stepping up to the plate and offering to help McKayla, although it might not be that easy. It also might not be something that McKayla wants. Here’s why.

Ask Our Leaders What They Will Do For Children In Care!

Some of our most vulnerable children are in care today, their voice often drowned out by other competing interests inside the system, so a recent call backed by children’s charities and support groups on our government leaders to pledge their support for these children during the Leaders’ Debate broadcast on 2nd April is a great idea.

You can read the Open Letter to our senior politicians here, which calls on the country’s leaders to tell the nation on 2nd April what they will do for children in care. Sadly, if pledges are made during the broadcast there is no way of enforcing them, but at least our politicians will be aware of what is important to the public moving forward. And we will all be watching them.

News. Nelsonville Bypass Getting New Barriers. By: Athens Messenger staff reports. Posted on:. Motorists driving the Nelsonville bypass might wonder why there are orange construction barrels lining the new highway on its western end.. A contractor will be installing cable barrier in the median of the highway, according to Alan Craig of the Ohio Department of Transportation's District 10 office.. Nationwide Construction Group, based in Michigan, has been awarded a nearly $1.54 million contract for the work, which will include the entire bypass and is scheduled to be completed this fall, Craig said.. The barrier — basically a guardrail made with cable rather than metal beams — is intended to prevent vehicles from crossing the median and hitting oncoming traffic, Craig said..

Rather that restrict traffic for the full length of the bypass at one time, it was decided to do the project in stages, Craig said.

Astronomical Society of South Australia

The Astronomical Society of South Australia (ASSA) was founded in 1892 and is the oldest society of its kind in Australia. It is the only representative body for amateur astronomy in the state of South Australia.
It holds regular general monthly meetings, frequent meetings for members of specialised groups and has available two observatories, one with a 300mm telescope at The Heights School within easy reach of Adelaide and used primarily for public viewing, and a second at Stockport with 500mm and 450mm telescopes presently in service and a larger 36-inch instrument currently being considered.

Membership
The ASSA has approximately 500 members. People of all ages are able to join.

Observatories and facilities
The ASSA has a choice of facilities available to members and guests:
Stockport Observatory - this was badly damaged  in a severe storm in 2010, but in late 2013 the Astronomical Society of South Australia was given $50,000 by the State Government to pay for half of the cost of a new dome. The observatory is used as a teaching tool, hosting groups of curious students and members the public, but it also has an impressive research record.

The question may sound strange but lately, reading immigration news, I started to wonder whether immigrating to Canada through the Quebec process was still worth it.

Indeed, prospective immigrants to Canada who are planning to settle in Quebec must go through “the Quebec process”, since the province selects immigrants to achieve certain objectives. Meanwhile, the federal government of Canada is still responsible for admitting immigrants.

So if you are planning to settle in Quebec, you must go through two distinct processes:

First, being selected by the provin­cial gov­ern­ment of Que­bec and obtain a Certificat de Sélection du Québec (CSQ). At this stage, your edu­ca­tional and work back­grounds are assessed, as well as your abil­ity to inte­grate into Que­bec.

Second, being accepted by the fed­eral gov­ern­ment of Canada. Per­ma­nent res­i­dence can be granted after a medical exam and a background check.

Those planning to settle in Quebec have long known that the additional step, obtaining a CSQ,incurred extra fees. For the principal applicant, it was CA$406 (before April 1, 2012) and for the spouse and each dependent child, it was CA$156. And each member of the family, including kids, needs a CSQ.

Yet prospective immigrants didn’t mind the extra cost and hassle for a lot of reasons:

Quebec has long favoured francophone immigrants and immigrating through the Quebec process was said to be easier than going through the federal process.

A lot of French speakers do want to settle in Quebec for linguistic or cultural reasons.

The province of Quebec heavily advertises immigrating to “la belle province” through a network of Bureaux d’Immigration du Québec (BIC) around the world that offers free information sessions.

The proof of funds required for Quebec-selected applicants is much lower than the proof of funds required for those immigrating to other provinces ($2,889 for one adult arriving in Quebec versus $11,115 for an adult settling anywhere else in Canada).

The immigration process through Quebec was said to be faster for qualified French speakers.

But lately, the Ministry of Immigration and Cultural Communities responsible for immigration matters in Quebec made a number of dramatic changes to the process.

First, on April 1, 2012, the fees levied by the Gouvernement du Québec for processing an immigration application were raised from $406 to $750—ouch! And don’t forget that the Quebec process is only half of the process, you still have the pay the permanent residence fees to the Government of Canada.

Second, to obtain the CSQ, even native French speakers (for instance, French citizens) must now take a French language test. The fees depend on where you take the test, but seem to be around €100 in France.

Third, Quebec is facing a heavy backlog of applications and obtaining a CSQ takes longer and longer. For instance, the Quebec visa office in Paris is currently processing applications it received in September 2011. For Northern Africa immigrants, processing times are much much longer: the Quebec visa office in Algeria is currently processing application received in… July 2008! You can see the processing times here for other visa offices around the world. And don’t forget that this is just one step of the process: the federal government then have to process your application!

So going through the Quebec process is now more expensive, with more hassle, and takes longer than ever—hence my initial question, “is it still worth it?”

I’m not arguing whether settling in Quebec is a good idea. I understand the province has a strong appeal for a lot of French speakers, and if you do plan to live in Quebec, you don’t have the choice, you must go through the Quebec immigration process.

But if you are hesitating between living in Quebec and living in other provinces, I’d urge you to see whether going through the federal process would be easier, faster and cheaper.

Sensitive, high-resolution observations of Galactic neutral hydrogen (HI) reveal an intricate network of slender linear features. Across the high Galactic latitude sky, this HI is aligned with the magnetic field as traced by both starlight polarization and Planck 353 GHz polarized dust emission. The structure of the neutral interstellar medium is more tightly coupled to the magnetic field than previously known. At high Galactic latitudes, where the Planck data are noise-dominated, the HI data provide an independent constraint on the plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation, and hence the local dust polarization angle. The HI data thus provide a new tool for measuring foregrounds to polarized CMB experiments. I will discuss ongoing work using HI morphology to better constrain the polarized foreground, and to better understand the nature of the magnetized ISM.. Magnetic Fields in the Interstellar Medium.

“This is not only an opportunity to invest in infrastructure and lay down the framework for what will be millions of square feet and dozens of buildings, said managing director for Goldman Sachs UIG Margaret Anadu, “but do so in a way that’s really going to benefit Baltimore residents.”

The $660 million tax increment funding (TIF) that Sagamore received last year from the city is cited as a key factor in the UIG’s decision to invest. Anadu said the TIF signified the project was supported by the city and displayed strong public-private partnerships

“With the approval of the TIF, that said the city and state were behind this,” she said. “Then you have Sagamore as the quarterback—they are relentless."

⇓ Article continues below ⇓

A key factor in the collaboration between the private and public sectors was the Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) signed last year between Sagamore, the city, and SB7—an organization that represents the South Baltimore communities of Brooklyn, Cherry Hill, Curtis Bay, Lakeland, Mt. Winans, Westport, and Port Covington. The agreement ensures that the communities in South Baltimore continue to thrive culturally, economically, educationally, and socially during the 20-year redevelopment process of Port Covington.

The $233 million investment will uphold the promise made in the CBA to invest in infrastructure—roads, utilities, and parks for the community—during all phases of the project. Goldman Sachs said they wouldn’t play a huge role in the planning process beyond the monetary impact.

“We will have a voice in the direction of the project,” Anadu said. “But we will primarily serve as investors, leaving day to day on-the-ground execution to the Sagamore team."

Plank Industries CEO, Tom Geddes, said the project would bring thousands of new jobs to the city, nearly 1.5 million square feet of office and retail space, a 200-room hotel, and apartments.

Of the 235 acres, a portion will remain untouched during the redevelopment, and that includes Under Armour’s 50-acre headquarters, as well as City Garage, Nick’s Fish House, Sagamore Spirit Distillery, and the newly opened Rye Street Tavern.

“You won’t see a lot of activity on the site over the next 12-18 months,” Geddes says. “But there will be a tremendous amount of behind-the-scenes work on planning and design going on getting the site shovel ready.”

The prospects of this new investment have Mayor Catherine Pugh optimistic about the new partnership and what it means for the city’s residents.

“This investment, especially from such a prominent partner as Goldman Sachs, means more jobs, more opportunity and more economic growth for Baltimore City,” she said in a statement. “Investors are seeing what we already know about Baltimore—we’re a city on the rise, and an economic hub with a strong, diverse workforce.”

This move comes as Sagamore is in the process of drafting a proposal to Amazon to move a second headquarters to the Port Covington development. Last week, the online retail giant released a statement requesting bids for the new location by October 19. If selected, it would bring 50,000 new jobs and a $5 billion investment in office space to Baltimore.

“We think Port Covington would be a phenomenal location for Amazon,” Geddes said. “Having the vote of confidence of an institution like Goldman Sachs is nothing but helpful.”

Geddes is hopeful that the new partnership represents progress for Port Covington and delivers on the commitment made to bring outside investments to the city.

“We could not be happier that we have Goldman Sachs as our partner,” Geddes said. “It was important to us to find an equity partner that shared our common vision for urban economic growth, job creation, and local workforce development here in Baltimore City.”

Fourteen normal subjects (18-42 y) were studied using venous occlusion plethysmography to investigate the characteristics and reproducibility of the forearm vasoconstrictor response following a prolonged venous occlusion stimulus. Upon release of the stimulus, a transient vasodilation is followed by a vasoconstriction. As the stimulus of venous occlusion pressure increased (40, 60, 80, and 100 mmHg for 5 min), there was a significant increase in maximum flow (p = 0.01). Minimum relative flow (minimum divided by control) was unchanged except at the highest occlusion pressure (0.49 +/- 0.05, 0.38 +/- 0.04, 0.47 +/- 0.07, 0.66 +/- 0.12, p = 0.04). As venous occlusion duration increased (3, 4, 5, and 6 min at 80 mmHg), there was no significant change in minimum relative flow (p = 0.73). With increasing ambient temperature (18, 23, and 28 degrees C), there were no significant changes in maximum or minimum relative flows (p = 0.40 and 0.25, respectively). Minimum relative flow was not significantly altered following occlusion with a 2.5-cm cuff vs. a 10-cm cuff (p = 0.77). Thus, the vasoconstriction response was reproducible over a range of venous occlusion stimuli and experimental conditions. We conclude that dynamic vascular responsiveness to prolonged venous occlusion can be measured by venous plethysmography and that calculation of the minimum flow relative to control flow is an appropriate and reproducible index of the vasoconstrictor response. Based on our studies and to conveniently measure these changes, we recommend a 10-cm venous occlusion cuff, with a pressure < or = 80 mmHg, for durations < or = 5 min, in an ambient temperature of 23 degrees C.

Transonic’s ELSA Monitor Featured on PerfWeb. VV ECMO, or veno-venous ECMO, primarily supports lung function. VV ECMO support can be obtained several ways. Commonly, a double lumen cannula is placed in the right internal jugular vien (right IJ people will know) or two cannulas are used, one residing in the right IJ and another in a femoral vein. The patient’s condition and age will depend on which option is used.. Recirculation is a known complication of VV ECMO that is oftentimes poorly understood and poorly addressed. To reduce this complication, the ECMO team needs an objective measurement for the optimal placement of dual-site cannulation or single dual-lumen cannulation. That’s where Transonic’s ELSA monitor comes in.. The ELSA monitor was recently featured on PerfWeb. Learn more about the monitor and how the PerfWeb panel uses it in this episode.

[Why is it so difficult to legislate on alcohol in Spain?].
Wine belongs to the Mediterranean culture. Drinking alcohol is part of our social life, and its negative consequences have often been minimised, blame being apportioned rather to the individual, who doesn't know how to drink, than to the agent causing the harm. In recent years, road accidents and binge-drinking among young people have put alcohol on the political agenda. Adolescents and young adults have increased their consumption, and a pattern of binge-drinking has developed based on the open-air 'fiesta' nightlife, where groups of young people drink large bottles in the streets and squares (botellón). Educational campaigns and material have been mounted and produced, but two consecutive draft laws on measures for the prevention of alcohol-related harm have failed to be approved, coming up on both occasions against the same vested interests. This editorial reviews the ambivalence of society towards regulations on alcohol and the current state of the art. The first draft law (2002) was about preventing alcohol problems in the general population; the second (2006) was limited to the question of prevention among minors. Nobody could oppose it, not even the industry. However, an interested bias put the accent on wine--which allegedly should be considered not as alcohol but rather as food, and consequently removed from the law--so that discussion of the draft law became a 'wine war', with predictable consequences. Once again, a draft law on alcohol was shelved sine die and tossed into a corner to gather dust. WithIn this pessimistic scene, though, there are still some positive signs. No economic or political motives should constitute an obstacle to the protection of minors, at the very least.

Ok, I am exhausted by this.. I cannot fathom the fact that Shopify fails to show prices with and without VAT properly. Ridiculous. My currency is SEK.. I downloaded Exemptify to display prices in both VAT and without. I added the snippet under the head as instructed.. Then when I look at my cart with a product, the vat prices look distorted. Absolutely ridiculous. Sorry if I sound angry but I am. Customers are not the most intelligent creatures and if they go to the checkout page and find "hidden" fees I am screwed.. I attached a picture.. I am on the same boat :-/. I will be following this topic to see if anyone has an answer.

Gravity Rush’s art draws heavily from the Franco-Belgian comic book style “bande dessinee” from the 1800-1920s, which is marked by exaggerating elements that the reader should pay the most attention to.. The art style is accompanied by a soundtrack reminiscent of the era, with strong accordion-driven scores. The result is a highly atmospheric game environment that is beautiful as much as it is addictive.

The Chief Whip said that the Congress leaders were trying to lead protests, based on lies. The only objective of the Congress party is to tarnish the image of IT Minister K Taraka Rama Rao (KTR), who has nothing to do with the incident, he added.. Dalits and Nerella victims are unhappy with the Congress party's efforts to turn a law & order issue into an issue for Vote bank politics, he observed. "The Congress's allegations of sand mafia against Minister KTR are laughable," he commented.. During the Congress regime, less than Rs 10 crores was added to the governement's exchequer, against revenue collected from the supply of sand from the 23 districts of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, Eshwar remarked. The sand policy being implemented in the state of Telangana is today, inspiring the nation, he added.. Please submit your comments.

Fish full life-cycle testing for 17beta-estradiol on medaka (Oryzias latipes).
We studied the chronic effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) on the reproductive status of medaka (Oryzias latipes) over two generations under continuous exposure to assess its hazard on this species. The exposure of parental (F0) medaka to E2 was begun on embryos within 12 h postfertilization and continued for up to 101 d; the assessment endpoints included embryological development, hatching, posthatch survival, growth, sexual differentiation, reproduction, and hepatic vitellogenin (VTG) levels under flow-through exposure to E2 at each mean measured concentration of 0.939, 2.86, 8.66, 27.9, and 92.4 ng/L. Eggs (F1) spawned from the F0 fish at 98, 99, and 100 d posthatch were also examined for hatchability, survival after hatching, growth, sexual differentiation, and hepatic VTG level until 59 d posthatch. In the F0 medaka, no concentration-related effect of E2 was observed on hatching, posthatch mortality, and growth. However, we observed abnormal sex differentiation, induction of VTG, and reproductive impairment in a dose-dependent manner. The lowest-observed-effect concentration and no-observed-effect concentration of E2 for these effects were 8.66 and 2.86 ng/L, respectively. In the F1 medaka treated with E2 at < or = 8.66 ng/L, however, dose-dependent effects were not observed in any parameter. The results indicate that E2 can have significant effects on reproductive potential of medaka at concentrations as low as 8.66 ng/L, suggesting that the ecological risk of E2 is higher than that of weak estrogens, such as nonylphenol and octylphenol.

Description: “Herbal chocolate tea made from the shell of the cacao bean.”. Review: I admit that I am a huge chocolate fan, so when MiCaco reached out to me and offered to let me try their tisane, I couldn’t say no! The tisane is made out of 100% cacao and is a blend of shell and nibs of the cacao bean.. The dry cacao was earthy and sweet, with a scent of dark chocolate, which became more pronounced when wet. The steeped liquor tasted earthy and fruity, with a lingering chocolate aftertaste. The aroma was sweet and chocolatey.. I could see this tisane tasting really nice with some additives such as milk which would make the liquor creamier. I would love to dry more chocolate teas in the future (3/5 rating).. 2 comments on “MiCacao’s Natural Cacao Tea | Tea Review”. That is one I definitely need to try!. I’m sorry! I thought I replied. I really enjoyed it. 🙂

When the grandkids come I give one of them a bandana to hold out of sight, I sneeze and tell Rocky to go find me a hanky. Of course, he gives them all the once over (to squeals of delight!) until he finds the one with the bandana. When he brings it to me he gets a treat.

The43 old tree frog used to say that it made him feel better just to see their knees coming toward him.. This tree frog is widespread in the coastal lowlands and in the Tepalcatepec Valley up to elevations of about 1200 meters.. The tree frog was also out, sitting in a cool, damp corner of125 the grass rows.. If they had but known it, the tree frog at that minute had ten legs, for six and four are ten.. The tree frog said that he remembered perfectly well when the eggs were laid on the wild cherry tree on the edge of the23 meadow.. There were screams of night birds, the long note of the owl, the tree frog beseeching stridently for rain.. You have acted as lazy as the tree frog says boys and girls sometimes do.. The leaves of this tree and especially its saplings, are favorite foraging places for the tree frog.. The tree frog and the eatable frog live in the north of Nippon.. For an answer to this the tree frog ran out his tongue, and, sure enough, it was fastened at the front end.

This just in from Pierre Lafond:. Hi,.. Santa Barbara Winery has been in its current location since 1965. We are very excited to have Lafond Winery tasting room coming to town! Customers will have a great view of the actual production. We have a glass door that leads to our bottling warehouse so they will be able to get a view of what goes on behind the scenes!. Cheers!.

Regulation of osteoclast apoptosis by Bcl-2 family protein Bim and Caspase-3.
Apopotosis of osteoclasts is regulated by the Bcl-2 family protein Bim. Bim is degraded in the course of osteoclast apoptosis, which is regulated by Caspase-3. Osteoclasts generated from caspase-3 -/- mice exhibited a shorter life span and a higher bone-resorbing activity than those generated from normal littermates. These results suggest the important role of Caspase-3-Bim axis in regulating both apoptosis and activation of osteoclasts.

Severity of acid gastroesophageal reflux assessed by pH metry: is it associated with respiratory disease?
About 50% of children with chronic respiratory diseases (RD) have "silent" gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Our purpose was to evaluate the possibility that RD in patients with GER reflects the presence of more severe acid reflux. We compared the severity of parameters from pH studies in children with chronic RD and "silent" GER, to children with signs of symptomatic gastrointestinal (GI) GER with and without RD. This study included 236 children (aged 1 month to 15 years) with abnormal 24-hr pH monitoring among 718 patients studied for suspected diagnosis of GER. Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 consisted of children with chronic RD but without any GI symptoms of GER. Group 2 was comprised of children with symptomatic GI presentation of GER such as regurgitation, vomiting, heartburn, and failure to thrive, but without any signs or symptoms of RD. Group 3 included children with prevalent RD and concomitant signs of symptomatic GER. Patients with predominant GI manifestations (group 2) had a significantly higher fraction of time with pH <4 (P < 0.01), total time value of pH <4 (P < 0.05), and longest episode with pH <4 (P < 0.05). Esophageal clearance was significantly longer in group 1 patients than in the other two groups (P < 0.05). Patients with mixed disease (group 3) were similar to patients in group 2. Patients with GI symptoms had significantly worse scores for all parameters evaluated except esophageal clearance score, compared to patients without GI symptoms. Longer esophageal clearance was the only parameter associated with respiratory signs in patients with respiratory symptoms compared to those without. In conclusion, the presence of RD in pediatric patients with silent GER is related to longer esophageal clearance, but is not related to severity of reflux.

[Ultrasonic mammography: its importance in integrated diagnosis of breast diseases (author's transl)].
Sonography of the breast is gaining in importance with the spread of diagnostic methods based on ultrasound in general and the increasing technical perfection of the equipment in particular. Over and above this, the increase in incidence of carcinoma of the breast at an increasingly early age represents a permanent challenge to achieve further optimisation of diagnostic methods. The following conclusions have been arrived at after evaluating 493 ultrasonic examinations of the breast, 212 of which were verified histologically (90 carcinomas): 1. If the indication is precise, sonography possesses a high degree of sensitivity in diagnosing any changes occurring in the breast. 2. The method offers particular advantages in patients with manifest signs having a dense parenchyma; in fact, with such patients sonography is often superior to mammography. 3. The additional use of sonography in diagnosis of diseases of the breast improves the results and often facilitates a less aggressive procedure (insofar as biopsies can be omitted). The main drawbacks are the great amount of time required for performing the examination, and the problem of documentation. This has been the major obstacle to using sonography in screening. The article discusses the indications, the typical sonographic criteria and problems of differential diagnosis in relation to the most frequently encountered diseases of the breast.

Furniture. Furniture. A piece of furniture serves two parameters – function and aesthetics within a given space. The furniture contains values of human need, it can be a human gesture, storage function or any experience dependent on the tenant and his various needs. The furniture creates a dialogue with itself as an object or sculpture in space and with furniture adjacent to it. The furniture creates a dialogue with itself as an object or sculpture in space and with furniture adjacent to it. The furniture gets a visual meaning since beyond its being a function, most of the daytime meets an aesthetic visual need.. The furniture is an object whose design is timeless and is not trendy and the thought of integrating it into space combines long-term thought. We combine three different furniture systems, which vary in size: furniture that is planned in detail by us, furniture that is purchased as new and existing furniture, which contains a dimension of obsolescence and other time.

AMD Threadripper 3rd Generation. AMD continues to impress with its new Desktop processor “Threadripper” third-generation CPU which is indeed an improvement on its predecessor.. What makes it a better performer than its 2nd gen predecessor?. The major difference between the two generations is the allocation of the memory controller. Previous gen processor allocated memory controller to certain memory die only. This resulted in the memory die without a memory controller to take an entire cycle in CPU to reach the ones with it.. Third Generation Threadripper has improved upon it by making a single I/O die which would have all the chiplets connected to. I/O die has PCX, memory access, SATA connection, and many more. Contrary to its predecessor, every chiplet can now access the memory directly and can contain 6 or 8 cores.

Q:

How to allow acces to a symbolic link in my ~/Sites/ for Apache under Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2

I need allow access to a sym-linked directory within ~/Sites from my Apache.
I Symlinked the directories like this
ln -s ~/path/to/the/source/directory/ ~/Sites/source-link-here

Now whenever I fire up a GET request I get a 403 reply
curl http://localhost/~username/source-link-here/
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
<title>403 Forbidden</title>
</head><body>
<h1>Forbidden</h1>
<p>You don't have permission to access /~username/source-link-here
on this server.</p>
...

How can I tell Apache to allow acces to the symlinked directory and how do I tell Apache
to allow this only for requests fired from localhost.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Best regards

    Allow from all
</Directory>

Edit the /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf file and make sure the line under “# Virtual hosts” is not commented out, like so:
Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

Edit the /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf file and add:

Present at the Creation: Planetary Resources, the Silicon Valley of Space

While it has been the cause of significant buzz, relatively little has been known about the company Planetary Resources other than the names of its A-list founders and backers that include James Cameron, Google's Eric Schmidt, Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Peter Diamandis, founder of the X Prize.

It's an impressive group, and that is why investor Ross Perot Jr. was not alone in his sentiment when he said "I believe in the team - betting on the jockey, not the horse."

Planetary Resources promises to be a fast horse as well. The company plans to send a fleet of droids to space to prospect the most valuable near-Earth asteroids. The project, which will require billions of investment dollars, could yield a trillion dollar reward, as precious metals exist in almost infinite quantities in space.

We learned a great deal more about the company yesterday at a public unveiling at the Museum of Flight in Seattle where the founders of Planetary Resources outlined their plan to "add tens of billions of dollars to the GDP annually."

"Since my early teenage years, I've wanted to be an asteroid miner," said founding member Peter Diamandis. "Now, the vision of my colleagues makes that dream not only a reality, but something we need to do."

Here's what Planetary Resources has done, and what they plan to do down the road.

The company has set up shop in Bellevue, WA, and currently employees two dozen engineers. "We're starting the Silicon Valley of space up here in Seattle," the founders announced. Indeed, part of the purpose of the public unveiling was to get the word out, as the company says it is looking to find "the world's best engineers."

"Not only can small groups of people change the world, it's the only thing that ever has."

If that statement has been true throughout history, Diamandis says a few important developments have enabled this specific innovation. These are:

Exponentially-growing technology is enabling small corporations using lower-cost robotics and spacecraft to do what only governments could do before.

Commercial space flight has finally arrived

Risk-tolerant investors like Elon Musk and Richard Branson have been willing to invest in space.

What this will enable Planetary Resources to do is "bring the solar system within our area of economic influence" said co-founder Eric Anderson. In other words, near-Earth asteroids in our solar system hold two enormously valuable resources in great abundance. These are:

Water: H20 is for drinking, of course, but also for propulsion. This resource will allow Planetary Resources to drastically reduce the cost of space exploration and open up "space gas stations" to support mining missions that will open up the road to deep space exploration.

Precious metals: Metals like platinum are useful in all sorts of industrial applications - from microelectronics to medical devices to catalytic converters.

So the founders of Planetary Resources clearly have their eyes on the prize -- but which prize precisely remains the question. There are nearly 9,000 discovered near-Earth asteroids to choose from, which represent 1 percent of the asteroids we believe to exist.

So the company plans to zero in on the specific asteroids they want to target, study the rotation rate, potential, and necessary support resources.

While they aren't afraid to dream big, the founders of Planetary Resources admit there's "a significant probability that we could fail, but we believe that the attempt is worth it." Indeed, they plan to live and learn from their failures, said Chris Lewicki, President & Chief Engineer of Planetary Resources.

While the task is indeed difficult, the founders pointed out that companies like Shell and others have created "fully robotic cities on the bottom of the ocean to drill for oil. This looks easy by comparison."

And what about the timeline? While the founders said "we come from the Burt Rutan school of not giving out timelines," Peter Diamandis did offer this explanation: "We aim to identify the first asteroids to prospect within the decade."

Broward Deputies Vote ‘No Confidence’ On Sheriff Israel

Broward Deputies Vote ‘No Confidence’ On Sheriff Israel

The deputies of Broward County have issued a stunning rebuke of Sheriff Scott Israel by voting “no confidence” in his leadership.

The deputies voted “no confidence” by a 534-94 margin and will ask Florida Governor Rick Scott to remove Israel from his position.

Sheriff Israel has faced intense scrutiny for the way he handled the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February.

Deputy Scot Peterson, the school resource officer on duty at the time of the shooting, waited outside when it was clear what was going on inside the school. It was later revealed that even after additional deputies arrived on scene, they waited behind their cars instead of entering the school and trying to eliminate the threat. The deputies were reportedly given an order to “stand down.” (RELATED: Broward County Sheriff Denies Mishandling Shooting Response)

Through my art, I want to reinforce the idea that it is important to take care of ourselves and reduce the risk of infection by wearing a mask. A mask is our current medicine, and I want to remind people through my art that we can reduce the risk of getting infected and instead stay healthy by wearing a mask, washing our hands, and maintaining social distance.

Farman F.160

__NOTOC__

The Farman F.160 was a heavy bomber aircraft developed in France in the late 1920s. It was essentially an attempt by Farman Aviation Works to modernise its tremendously successful F.60 Goliath design of the immediately postwar years. The most noticeable external difference was the larger tailfin of the new aircraft. Like its predecessor, it was a large three-bay biplane of conventional configuration with unstaggered wings of equal span. Initially conceived as a heavy night bomber, most examples built were float-equipped torpedo bombers for the Aéronautique Maritime, which operated some 40 of the F.165 variant and 200 of the F.168. One of the original F.160 night bombers was exported to Italy, and one to Japan. Plans to develop airliner versions did not progress past the prototype stage.

Variants
F.160 Four-seat night bomber with two  Farman 12We engines, designated F.160 BN.4 by Aviation Militaire.
F.161 One airliner with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Akx engines and one bomber similar to the F.160, powered by 2x  Farman 12Wers engines.
F.162 One prototype airliner with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Akx engines.
F.163 Airliner with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Aa engines.
F.165 Seaplane torpedo bomber with 2x Gnome-Rhône 9A  or 9Aa engines.
F.166 2x  Salmson 9Ab engines.
F.167 Seaplane torpedo bomber with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Aa engines.
F.168 Seaplane torpedo bomber with Gnome-Rhône 9Akx engines; main production version, 200 built.
F.169 Improved airliner version with Gnome-Rhône 9Akx engines.
F.268 One F.168 fitted with 2x supercharged  Salmson 18 Abs engines.
F.269 One F.169 fitted with floats and modified wings as a sesquiplane seaplane.
F.368 One F.168 re-engined with 2x  Gnome-Rhône 9Kbrs engines.

H. Clay Earles

Henry Clay Earles (August 11, 1913 – November 16, 1999) was the founder and chairman of the board of Martinsville Speedway, a NASCAR stock car racing track that Earles built in 1947 in Ridgeway, Virginia that was one of the circuit's first paved oval tracks and stands as one of its shortest.

Born in Axton, Virginia on August 11, 1913, Earles started making money as a five-year-old, selling unwanted leaves from his father's tobacco farm. Initially educated in a one-room schoolhouse, he dropped out of school so that he could help support his family with the 25 cents he earned each hour at a furniture factory.

His first business venture was a failed pool hall, but a gas station was successful and its profits helped pay for a drive-in restaurant in Martinsville, Virginia. The restaurant was sold to buy another gas station. Having seen the crowds attracted by car racing at temporary tracks at fairgrounds, he built a track on  of land he had purchased in 1946. The first scheduled race, predating the establishment of NASCAR, took place on September 7, 1947, drawing more than 6,000 spectators at a facility that only had 750 seats; Seating capacity had grown to 86,000 by the time of Earles' death. In its inaugural year, Bill France, Sr. provided the track with advertising and drivers in exchange for one-fourth of profits, and became the founding president of NASCAR when it was incorporated the next year. Martinsville Speedway is the only one of NASCAR's original tracks still in use.

Red Byron was awarded a $500 prize for winning the inaugural race at the track, which had grown to $170,000 by 1999. Earles began a tradition in 1964 of distributing grandfather clocks to race winners, with Richard Petty receiving a track-record of 12, and would have received three more for wins that predated the inception of the practice.

The track measures  around, with a pair of  straightaways and tight turns banked at 12 degrees, described as two dragstrips with tight turns. The track was first paved in 1955. Unlike the superspeedways, Martinsville became a track where the skill and strategy of each individual driver could overcome the big money and horsepower of the larger teams.

Earles died at age 86 on November 16, 1999 at his Martinsville home.

SIDEBAR: Strub recounts how he took activism to the streets, and the Church

by Chuck Colbert

One need not be Roman Catholic to understand that Sean Strub’s new book “Body Counts” is in no small measure fueled partly by his faith. From the very beginning, Strub calls out the Church and its hierarchical leadership on many fronts, everything from hypocrisy to hostility, as the AIDS epidemic continues to wreak havoc on gay men and others.

The preface, for example, recounts AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power’s (ACT UP) liturgical disruption, staged on Sunday, Dec. 10, 1989 at New York’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral, arguably a major power center of American Catholicism. Inside, Strub was among the protestors.

Indeed, crashing then-Cardinal John O’Connor’s Sunday Mass was controversial, if not the most controversial of ACT UP’s activism.

“After Mass, I pass through the cathedral’s heavy doors into bright sunlight, and it seems to me into the arms of my true community,” Strub wrote. “I am exultant, in a state that feels like grace, certain that if I am to die of AIDS, I will die a fighter.”

In chapter 17, Strub’s sharpened quill reminds readers that O’Connor “condemned LGBT activism, opposed anti-discrimination statutes, called homosexuality an ‘intrinsic evil,’” at the same time he “prevented groups of gay Irish-Americans from participating in the annual St. Patrick’s Day parade and kicked Dignity, the gay Catholic group, out of all facilities controlled by the archdiocese, where they had celebrated Mass for many years.”

Strub recalled how New York City’s cardinal archbishop banned church-run hospitals from distributing condoms or discussing safe sex with patients, even as staff nurses, doctors and nuns widely ignored his directive.

Most egregious perhaps, O’Connor funded a disinformation campaign, claiming on billboards, buses and subways that “condoms don’t work,” by citing discredited statistics that suggested a 50 percent failure rate or greater. The cardinal “even opposed condom use between two partners when one was known to be HIV positive.”

“At the same time,” Strub wrote, “O’Connor took every opportunity to boast the Church’s compassion toward people with AIDS who were dying in church-run hospices. His hypocrisy was galling; most of the world hated gay people when we were healthy and sexually active but accepted us as dying ‘AIDS’ victims.”

The last straw for Strub and others was the cardinal’s blocking safer-sex education via condom use in New York City schools. “We knew we had to do something,” Strub wrote, explaining in part ACT UP’s decision to disrupt Mass.

During a recent telephone interview, Stub, who for a short time thought he had a calling to the priesthood, spoke of his Irish Catholic upbringing. “I certainly grew up in a Catholic environment,” he said, noting his father’s devotion to the Blessed Virgin. Nuns raised his mother, an orphan.

And yet Strub acquired “skepticism about the Church,” growing up in Iowa City, Iowa, a college town where he was “exposed to a lot of different kinds of values and perspectives,” he said. Just as Strub absorbed Catholicism’s social justice tradition, so he learned the “you-will-do-as-we-are-told aspect of the Church,” he said.

“When I came out in the late 70s, that started a fissure with the Church that only grew over time,” as the epidemic only exacerbated the rift. With the death of his partner Michael in 1988, Strub said, “I went into a kind of hyperactive activist overdrive.”

The cover of “Body Counts” features a picture of Strub and then-partner Michael Misove.

Strub also discussed the historical significance of taking AIDS activism to a nerve center of the Catholic Church in America. Undoubtedly controversial, Strub always favored the St. Patrick’s Cathedral protest. “If one scans the list of who got arrested” — Strub was not — “half inside and half outside,” he said, “the preponderance of those inside were culturally Catholic with Irish, Italian, and Polish surnames. That explains what drove a lot of the action. A lot [of those arrested] grew up in the Church and still felt some right, some piece of ownership that we could take our redress to the Church. For me, it was the culmination of a year’s mourning.”

For all the controversy, opposition and risk, ACT UP decided to go ahead with the protest. “We did it anyway because it was so important,” said Strub, noting, from historical hindsight, its historical significance: “December 1989 was 20 years after Stonewall. While Stonewall was the first time the gay community kind of really fought back against the civil code that oppressed us, and it was landmark, opening up a floodgate of a whole generation protesting the civil code.”

By comparison, Strub continued, “The action at St. Pat’s was the first time we did that against the religious and moral code. We did the unthinkable and took it to their turf. And I think that also opened up the floodgates. Right about then marked a peak moment of influence for the Catholic Church in America. It has declined ever since not just because of that action. It was the sex scandals and all that.”

Sure enough, he said, “We took [Church leaders] down a peg, and they never recovered in terms of their political influence. In a sense, that St. Pat’s action ranks up there with Stonewall in terms of importance.”

Monosaccharide Derivatives with Low-Nanomolar Lectin Affinity and High Selectivity Based on Combined Fluorine-Amide, Phenyl-Arginine, Sulfur-π, and Halogen Bond Interactions.
The design of small and high-affinity lectin inhibitors remains a major challenge because the natural ligand binding sites of lectin are often shallow and have polar character. Herein we report that derivatizing galactose with un-natural structural elements that form multiple non-natural lectin-ligand interactions (orthogonal multipolar fluorine-amide, phenyl-arginine, sulfur-π, and halogen bond) can provide inhibitors with extraordinary affinity (low nanomolar) for the model lectin, galectin-3, which is more than five orders of magnitude higher than the parent galactose; moreover, is selective over other galectins.

Abstract. To achieve very high data rates (>109 bits/s) in optical data storage systems it is necessary to employ a large number of laser beams for parallel read–write–erase operations. Bringing all these beams to diffraction-limited focus with a high-numerical-aperture objective lens (while maintaining focus and tracking) requires techniques that are fundamentally different from those that are currently practiced in the field of optical data storage. We present two possible solutions to the problem of designing an objective lens for such systems, one involving an array of high-quality lenslets and the other based on a single, high-numerical-aperture annular-field-of-view conventional lens. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, on which we elaborate in the course of our discussions.. © 1999 Optical Society of AmericaFull Article | PDF Article

Abstract. This paper analyses the changing nature of relationships between adults and young people. Adopting aspects of the work of Frank Furedi, the question of the socialisation of children is addressed. It is argued that the problematisation of behaviour, coupled with the development of new state and institutional processes, has led to a growing spread of ‘professional’ and contractual involvement in everyday life. This is something that relates to and is accelerated by the emergence of micro-politics and micro-social policy over the last few decades. This colonisation of the lifeworld, it is argued, is increasingly formalising informal relationships and undermining spontaneous relationships between adults and young people. It also distorts the nature of professions and the relationships developed between them and young people. The real relationships between adults and young people are consequently being undermined and replaced by an ersatz form of socialisation.

Psychiatric disorders and general medical conditions: implications for the clinician.
Patients with severe mental illness have higher than expected prevalence rates of co-morbid general medical conditions, particularly metabolic and cardiovascular disease. They are also at increased risk of contracting HIV. Conversely, these and other medical disorders also increase the risk of developing mental disorders. Mental illness and general medical conditions have mutually adverse effects on long-term outcome. This interaction of diseases contributes significantly to the excess morbidity in and higher than expected standard mortality ratios for patients with mental illness. As medical practice becomes more specialized and arguably compartmentalized it may increasingly fail to integrate health care for patients with severe mental illness. In this paper we discuss the high co-morbidity of mental illness with other medical disorders as well some of the potential mechanisms involved. We furthermore argue that the bidirectional relationship between mental and medical disorders should be considered in the planning of treatment for either group of disorders. The central role of the psychiatrist in co-ordinating and integrating the health care of patients with severe mental illness is emphasized.

In order to improve viewing angle dependency of γ characteristics of a liquid crystal display device (e.g. prevent excess brightness etc. of a screen), there have been proposed liquid crystal display devices (based on a pixel-division system, see Patent Literature 1 for example) for controlling a plurality of sub-pixels in one pixel so that the plurality of sub-pixels have different luminances and displaying a halftone by area coverage modulation of these sub-pixels.
FIG. 49 is a schematic view showing an example of a pixel structure of a liquid crystal display device 1000 of Patent Literature 1. The liquid crystal display device 1000 includes a scanning signal line 1002 and a data signal line 1003 that are provided on a glass substrate 1001 and a pixel 1004 provided in the vicinity of an intersection of the two signal lines. The pixel 1004 consists of two sub-pixels 1005a and 1005b. The two sub-pixels 1005a and 1005b include transistors 1006a and 1006b and pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b connected with the transistors 1006a and 1006b, respectively, and the pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b form capacitors (retention capacitors 1009a and 1009b) with retention capacitor lines 1008a and 1008b, respectively. Although not shown, the pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b are designed such that a liquid crystal material (liquid crystal layer) is sandwiched between the glass substrate 1001 and a common electrode (counter electrode) on a surface of a substrate (color filter substrate).
FIG. 50 is a drawing showing an electrically equivalent circuit corresponding to the pixel structure shown in FIG. 49 of the liquid crystal display device 1000. The pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b shown in FIG. 49 correspond to points 1010a and 1010b shown in FIG. 50, respectively, and form liquid crystal capacitors 1012a and 1012b, respectively, with a common electrode 1011.
In the above configuration, different signals are supplied to the retention capacitor lines 1008a and 1008b, respectively. This allows differentiating potentials (pixel potentials) of the pixel electrodes 1007a and 1007b from each other.

Article Text. Abstract. Suppression scotomas and retinal projection (retinal correspondence) were measured in six intermittent exotropes during deviation. Measurements used red-green anaglyph stimuli presented on a black background which could be varied from 3.4 minutes of arc to 3 degrees 24'. Results showed non-suppression of all points between the fovea and the diplopia point. Harmonious anomalous retinal correspondence was usually observed. Two subjects had spontaneous changes from anomalous retinal correspondence to normal retinal correspondence without a concurrent change in ocular position. Conventional testing resulted in more variable results in regard to retinal correspondence and suppression, suggesting that non-suppression and anomalous retinal correspondence occur when black backgrounds are used.

Effect of Wnt inhibitors in pancreatic cancer.
Activated Wnt signaling in cancer cells leads to cell proliferation. It has been shown that the Wnt pathway is activated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. Therefore, we tested the effect of Wnt inhibitors in human and murine pancreatic cancer cell lines. The Wnt inhibitors ethacrynic acid (EA), ciclopirox olamine (CIC), piroctone olamine (PO) and griseofulvin (GF) were tested in murine and human pancreatic cancer cell lines with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. We showed that the Wnt inhibitors significantly reduced cell viability in murine, as well as human pancreatic cancer cell lines. These results may lead to a new therapeutic option with Wnt inhibitors for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Motives and health-related behaviours: an investigation of equipotentiality and equifinality.
We investigated the phenomena of equipotentiality (one dispositional motive expressed through more than one behaviour) and equifinality (one behaviour serving more than one motive). In a cross-sectional survey, 244 young adults completed measures of sun-related behaviour and risky sexual behaviour, participatory motives for the behaviours and life goals (representing dispositional motives). Equipotentiality was demonstrated, in that power and diversity life goals each predicted more than one behaviour. Equifinality was demonstrated, in that sun exposure and risky sexual behaviour were each predicted by more than one life goal. Participatory motives mediated these relationships. Equipotentiality and equifinality need to be taken into account in health promotion.

Developing academic leaders in Geriatric Psychiatry with clinical/educational and research expertise is a national priority. This proposal is designed to developed the nominee's capability as an independent researcher and resource person in geriatric psychiatry at MCV/VCU. Specifically, the nominee plans to: a) pursue additional training in statistics and epidemiological research methods; b) pursue research supervision from senior faculty at the university and external experts in geriatric psychiatry; c) develop research programs expanding clinical understanding of aggressive behavior in Alzheimer's Disease patients; and d) establish a network of research at MCV/VCU to promote collaborative research in geriatric mental health.

As one of high speeding techniques of image display in an information display control system, there is a technique of using an atlas image (also referred to as a “texture atlas”) in which a plurality of images are unified into one image. Since the plurality of images can be taken out of one texture atlas, the texture atlas is created in advance, whereby a number of readout times of image files is reduced, and a readout time of image data can be shortened.
In an event of creating the texture atlas, it is a challenge to determine how to efficiently arrange the plurality of images, which are different from one another in size, on the texture atlas. In usual, since the images for use in the information display control system are rectangular, this challenge can be handled as a “rectangle packing problem” in which rectangles are arranged on a two-dimensional surface with a fixed area without overlapping one another. A variety of approximate methods are known with regard to the rectangle packing problem. For example, the Best-fit method proposed in following Non-Patent Literature 1 is an algorithm that repeatedly packs rectangles which can use gaps to the maximum.

Inhibition of aflatoxin B1-induced gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase positive (GGT+) hepatic preneoplastic foci and tumors by low protein diets: evidence that altered GGT+ foci indicate neoplastic potential.
Previous studies in this laboratory with young Fischer 344 male rats have shown that the post-initiation development of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase positive (GGT+) hepatic foci was markedly inhibited by low protein feeding, even though the energy intake was greater. This dietary effect, however, did not necessarily apply to hepatic tumor development. Thus, the present investigation was undertaken to examine this dietary effect upon the development of hepatic tumors and, is so doing, to determine the correlation of foci development with tumor development. Following AFB1 dosing (15 daily doses of 0.3 mg/kg each), animals were fed diets containing 6, 14 or 22% casein (5.2, 12.2, 19.1% protein) for 6, 12, 40, 58 and 100 weeks. Foci at 12 weeks and tumors at 40, 58 and 100 weeks developed dose-dependently to protein intake. Foci development, tumor incidence, tumor size and the number of tumors per animal were markedly reduced while the time to tumor emergence was increased with low protein feeding. Non-hepatic tumor incidence also was lower in the animals fed the lowest protein diet. Foci development indices (foci number, per cent liver volume occupied) were highly correlated with tumor incidence at 58 and 100 weeks (r = 0.90-1.00). Tumor and foci inhibition occurred in spite of the greater energy intake.

The lucky numbers were initially thought to be a way to tell the Tazos apart (i.e. 45 is the highest lucky number, so the thought was that it would be a set of 45), but this has been found to be untrue, and, if sorting Tazos based on their Lucky Numbers, then many gaps will appear in the set. There has, however been found to be only the 3 variations per Tazo, making a complete set of only 30.

Personal Information on Students Slip from Teacher’s PC onto Internet

Personal information relating to around 10,000 students slipped onto the net when a high school teacher in Ichinomiya, Aichi Prefecture, used file-sharing software on his computer that stored the records, the prefecture's board of education said on June 30, 2007.

According to assumptions, the information leaked due to a virus in file-swapping program from a computer located in the residence of the 43-year old teacher employed at Ichinomiya Technical Upper Secondary School.

The teacher said that apart from the students' information, his PC also had the list of ASDF (Association of Synchronous Data Formats) officers who retired from service. His mother had asked him to compile it. She was attached to the Self-Defense Forces, the board of education said, as reported by The Japan Times on July 1, 2007.

The board also reported that the divulged data included records on students of two different schools where the teacher worked. That comprised of 10-years records of 7,000 students from his current school and 5-years records of 7,545 students form his previous school. The information consisted of students' names, birth dates, parents' names and grades.

The exact number of students affected due to the leak is not known as some of the records were in duplicates, the board said. The leak consisted of around 14,600 pieces of information. Personal information relating to personnel of the Air Self -Defense Force's Gifu Air Base in Kakamigahara, Gifu Prefecture, was also leaked from the teacher's computer. The leaked data included rolls of retired staff and everything about the events that took place at the base.

The education board said the leaked information was actually internal data saved since the academic year 1994 at the Technical Upper Secondary School and a high school where the teacher had worked earlier. The information collected was for the purpose of assisting students in choosing their careers. Therefore, it included students' names, careers they wished, academic results, technical school and university entrance exam results, and character evaluations.

The Board said there were no reports of misuse of data so far. But it will apologize to students and their parents and will take action against the teacher.

Democratic leaders are scrambling after a hashtag went viral on Twitter by fed-up Democrats that are walking away from the party. Former Dem loyalists are tired of the far-left rhetoric and alt-left violence — and that’s trouble for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and company come November.

The #Walkaway movement was started by a registered Democrat that decided to walk away from liberalism after deciding that the party was taking advantage of its own racial, sexual, and religious minorities in America.

The campaign quickly caught on with social media users sharing their own walk away stories.

Actor James Woods joined in on the movement sharing his story behind leaving the Democratic party.

Hi, I just recently started looking at HTML5 and noticed the video tag. Neat addition. I also noticed that it as an attribute named 'pixelratio', however, as you know this is never an integer, but rather is the result of a fraction (i.e. ratio). As for proper playback of video frames, it is important to understand exact float and therefore I would suggest either expressing it as a ratio of two 32-bit integers separated by a colon (or slash) or use two different attributes. This avoids unintentional rounding. Something roughly along the lines of: <video pixelratio="10:11"> <!-- 525 composite NTSC --> <video pixelratio="59:54"> <!-- 625 composite PAL --> <video pixelratio="1018:1062"> <!-- 1920x1035 HDTV SMPTE RP 187-1995 --> <video parhSpacing="10" parvSpacing=11"> Container formats tend to store this information in a ratio like this and not in a float.

A couple of months ago, we got excited because we saw Charlton station had gained a new water fountain. It was all part of a London-wide plan to provide more drinking water taps, and reduce the need for people to buy plastic bottles of water. There was a heatwave on, it sounded fantastic.. Then a few weeks after it opened, it was covered up again. And moved. It’s still covered up today. Our refillable bottles have remained unfilled.. We asked Thames Water what was going on. A spokesperson got back to us very quickly and told us: “At the moment the water coming from the fountain isn’t of the standard we’d expect so we can’t let anyone use it until it passes all the right tests.”. Thames Water emphasises there is no issue with water in the wider area – it’s just an issue that affects the fountain.. Hopefully the fountain will be back in service soon.

Statement. My father became a street photographer when he was eighteen in the late 1960’s, and ever since he documented life around him as it is - with artistic thought, but also a quickness of catching the moment as it’s being created. I was always extremely in awe of his work and soon, when he gave me a film camera for my 16th birthday, I started following his path of catching the moments around me.

Can a hill vanish? Apparently yes!

At least that is what the Rajasthan government has told the Supreme Court. During the hearing of a case related to the illegal minings in Aravalli, the Rajasthan Government told the Apex Court that 28 out of 138 hills in Aravalli region near Delhi border have disappeared.

The Supreme Court bench comprising Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta was, however, not convinced, and asked the government if people had become Hanuman and they are running away with the hills.

The court which observed that Rajasthan has taken the issue of illegal mining "very lightly" and ordered the government to stop all illegal mining in a 115.34-hectare area in Aravalli hills within 48 hours.

The apex court also referred to a central empowered committee report that 31 hills or hillocks have vanished in the state's Aravalli area.

The court also noted that the disappearance of hills in Rajasthan could be one reason for the rise in pollution levels in Delhi.

A Message from Our CEO. Dear Guests,.. My vision is to provide a sanctuary for each and every guest in a peaceful environment that will allow for relaxation, rejuvenation and a place to re-energize ones’ spirit. We are all “caretakers” in one way or another and often we forget about the person most important – ourselves. Caretakers often forget that “self-care” is tremendously important. We must all remind ourselves that giving time to yourself is not selfish. Taking care of one’s “SELF” first, makes taking care of others so much easier.. Namaste,. Julie Nguyen

Archive Article: 1997/12/12. From Arthur Staniforth, Summertown, Oxford. The first tractor I drove was a Fordson "red-spot". It was fitted with spade lugs and belonged to the Somerset War Agricultural Committee.. A student at Reading University, my holiday job was to go round ploughing up grass fields that had been scheduled by the War Ag. I had the old road menders caravan to live in and steel bands to put round the tractor wheels for road travel.. It was good tractor and pulled a two-furrow Ransome plough. Petrol was used for start up with TVO being switched to when it had warmed up. Starting it in the morning was the hardest part – it took some swinging and had a kick like a mule: Never put your thumb round the handle.. By present day standards the seat was incredibly uncomfortable and I spent most of the time when ploughing standing up – there was just enough room for that.

Brattain–Hadley House

The Brattain–Hadley House was located in Springfield, Oregon and was formerly listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Fire destroyed much of the house in 1997, and in 2012 a demolition contractor removed the house for safety reasons.

Paul Brattain, an 1852 pioneer, obtained a 160-acre donation land claim soon after moving from Iowa to Oregon. The Brattain farm was entirely within modern Springfield city limits.

When Brattain died in 1893, his descendants built the Queen Anne style house. Paul Hadley, Brattain's grandson, was the last of Brattain's descendants to occupy the house in the 1940s. Hadley's daughter, Mary Hadley Callis, allowed vagrants to occupy the house until the 1997 fire.  The house was removed from the National Register on May 8, 2012.

I only started reading this book because my grandma gave it to me for christmas and told me that it was "a wonderful book that made me think of you". I put off reading it for about 6 months but then I didn't have any new books to read so I picked this one up. Belive me, I don't like reading non-fiction books, so it's pretty amazing that a real-life story about a cat pulled me in so fast. It's a really interesting yet funny book, so good that I made excuses to use it for my "survival" unit in school. *warning* I got a little bit tierd with all of the cat stuff as the book went on.

The ERA Toronto team recently had the privilege to head out to LA for a few days and join up with our LA team to do a few rooms in the area between our visits to Hollywood and Six Flags. One of the companies we got to visit during our trip was Xscape Pods. Xscape Pods are a relatively new company, having been in business for just over a year. They’re a small, family-owned company who have done a good job of coming up with some cool and unique room designs.

Finding our way to Xscape Pods was fairly straightforward. They’re located in a strip mall, so there was plenty of parking, and they had a nice big sign above their storefront. The lobby was very creatively decorated, with quite a sci-fi feel, some nice comfy couches, and a few unique and interesting decorations. We were given a warm welcome by the owners, after which we watched a short rules video and then we were off to play the room! The intro video was shown in the room itself; unfortunately, due to some technical difficulties, we only got to see about the first half, but it was still enough to get the gist and set the tone for the game to come.

The room itself felt slightly spartan, but this was appropriate given that it was supposed to be a generic government office. The props felt authentic enough and got the job done, although a few of them were starting to show signs of some wear and tear. One puzzle was a little bit fiddly, but another puzzle did a good job of making use of a cool, high-tech prop that really added to the atmosphere.

The immersion was decent, with background music and sound effects evoking a military base. Again, we missed out on some of the intro video due to technical difficulties, so the story was a little unclear, and there didn’t appear to be much by way of story development as we progressed. One cool reveal helped pull us back into the story for a bit, but at other times we were simply going through the motions.

Similarly, the puzzles generally felt merely competent. There were no team-building puzzles, no big “wow” moments, and quite a few coding/decoding puzzles. Most things made sense, and there weren’t any large leaps of logic required, but at a few points we found ourselves a little lost and unsure what to tackle next.

In the end, we did enjoy ourselves while playing this room, but weren’t necessarily blown away by it. There were a few cool moments, but nothing that really made it stand out. Overall though still a solid room and worth playing should you find yourself in the area.

It is common in many industries that various materials or mixtures of materials require drying at some stage of processing. One example is the drying of (i.e. the removal of water from) coal and coal wash fines in the mining industry. Traditionally, industrial drying has been accomplished through application of heat to bring a moisture laden material to elevated temperatures so that the moisture will evaporate and/or boil away from the material. This approach, however, requires large amounts of energy to produce and apply the heat. This energy is usually derived from the burning of fossil or other fuels, which is not very efficient, is not generally eco-friendly, and in fact is a pollution generator in its own right. At least partially for these reasons, the burning of fossil fuels in the coal mining industry to dry material such as coal wash fines is strictly regulated.
In addition to drying needs, there are industrial needs for transitioning a substance with a vapor pressure threshold from one phase to another phase. Examples include, distilling, mixing, desalinating, recovering oil from oil shale and oil sands, recovering purified distilled water from contaminated water, distilling alcohols from a mash or other mixture, and many others. Desalinization of seawater to produce potable water is one example of a desalinating application. Traditional techniques for desalinizing seawater have tended to require large amounts of externally generated energy in the form of heat, which, again, usually involves the burning of fossil fuels, is exceedingly inefficient, and generally is not eco-friendly. Artificial snow-making also is an industry where the making of artificial snow from water is energy intensive and inefficient, and produces a poor substitute for natural snow. Pond evaporation is another example of an industry that consumes large amounts of energy to produce heat for boiling water or other substances, pollutes the atmosphere, and is generally inefficient. The above examples represent only a few throughout various industries.
A need exists for methods and systems to perform these and many other related industrial tasks more efficiently, using much less energy, requiring the addition of little or no externally generated heat or thermal energy, and in a manner that produces little or no harmful atmospheric emissions and thus is eco-friendly. It is to the provision of such methods and systems that the present disclosure is primarily directed.

Demons Training Session

Natalie did a surprise appearance at a Demons AFL training session in Melbourne this Wednesday. In town for this weekend’s NGV Gala, she took time out to check out how the Dees were coming along in pre-season.

Apparently, Natalie’s best friend, a big Demons supporter, was the reason behind her visit. Their children took part in the warm-up with the players.

Natalie also donned an AFLW guernsey and there were plenty of fans on social media who were happy with her choice of club. As usual, Zimbio has several photos:

Effect of protein kinase C on amylase secretion and cyclic AMP production in rat pancreatic acinar cells.
The authors examined the effects of protein kinase C on secretin-induced amylase release and cyclic AMP production in rat pancreatic acinar cells. Secretin (10(-6) M) and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (10(-6) M) induced 53% and 60% increase of amylase release from the basal level, respectively during 10 min. Simultaneous addition of TPA and secretin resulted in 42% amylase release from the basal level for 10 min. Suppression of secretin-induced amylase release was evident within 5 min of pretreatment with TPA. TPA showed the same effect on cyclic AMP production; secretin-induced increase of cyclic AMP was suppressed by pretreatment of TPA for 5 min. To explore the mechanism by which TPA inhibits secretin-induced cyclic AMP production, we also examined the effects of protein kinase C purified from rat brain on adenylate cyclase activity in pancreatic acinar membranes. Basal, forskolin- and secretin plus guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]trisphosphate-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity were inhibited by protein kinase C in the presence of Ca++. These results suggest that protein kinase C might have a role in the inhibitory effect on adenylate cyclase in exocrine pancreas.

Transcendental and Optimized Digital Designing Using Reversible Logic. The approach in the reversible logic design differs significantly from the traditional combinational logic design. In reversible logic circuit, the number of input lines should be equal to the number of output lines with each output line being used only once thereby making the resulting circuit acyclic. Thus a reversible logic gate is an n-input, n-output device with one-to-one mapping. This helps in the determination of the outputs from the inputs and vice-versa, i.e. there is one-to-one correspondence between the input and the output vectors..

Lee, Rona (2009) Truthing Gap. [Show/Exhibition]Full text not available from this repository.. Abstract. Oceanographic survey offers no grounding in questions of representation, such as mapping as an expression of power, or inter-subjective relations between observer and observed. Existing practice involves the reprocessing of sonar data to create drained and illuminated, photorealistic, virtual models, over which the disembodied eye may freely roam.. Situated and ‘situationist’, Truthing Gap employed conjectural understanding, participant observation (work with geophysical modelling/mapping software and underwater vehicles/cameras), performative experiments and interventions, alongside alternative modes of data capture and making tactile cartographies, to address the role of representational vocabularies in configuring human/non-human relations and the capacity of contemporary artistic practice to re-think dominant environmental imaginaries..

I just came across an interesting article by Jeffrey Joerres on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal Europe (April 9, 2009) entitled Aging Your Work Force. The article is about the challenge of an aging workforce in Europe and says that “a loss of productivity and intellectual capital as baby boomers leave the work force could devastate some businesses. Europe’s work force will begin shrinking in the coming years and is expected to become 15% smaller within five decades, according to the OECD. The countries with the biggest threat are those with the oldest populations, particularly Germany and Italy.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering applying 25 percent tariffs on around $3.5 billion of imports from the United States if President Donald Trump carries out his plan to apply global duties to steel and aluminum, EU sources say.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

The European Commission has said it would respond “firmly” to proposed U.S. import duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.

It has spelt out it would join others in a challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and consider safeguard measures, last deployed in 2002, to guard against steel and aluminum being diverted to Europe from elsewhere if U.S. tariffs come in.

A further counter-measure under consideration would specifically target the United States to “rebalance” trade between the two, EU sources say.

The U.S. tariffs would be officially brought in on grounds of national security, but the European Union says U.S. military requirements represent no more than 3 percent of U.S. production and that the measures are really a form of protectionism for U.S. manufacturers.

EU exports of steel to the United States in 2017 were worth 5.3 billion euros ($6.53 billion) and of aluminum 1.1 billion euros.

For certain grades of steel, the United States cannot show there was any increase of imports last year, the EU sources say, meaning it would not be allowed to apply safeguard measures to them. For the EU, exports of those grades amounted to 2.8 billion euros ($3.5 billion).

Assuming U.S. tariffs fully covered EU steel, the European Union would put forward 25 percent tariffs on 2.8 billion euros worth of goods from the United States.

About a third would be steel grades, another third other industrial products and a final third agricultural products.

The list of products is set to be presented next week to EU countries, whose approval would be needed.

The “rebalancing” would have to take place within three months.

Explanation of implants is indicated for implant rupture, infection, extrusion, siliconoma, breast pain, painful capsular contracture, malposition, significant patient fear, and systemic symptoms thought secondary to implants. A number of alternatives are available for postexplant reconstruction, including myocutaneous flaps and free tissue transfers.

It's been a long journey, but puzzle platformer Yumi's Odd Odyssey, known as Farewell Umihara Kawase in Japan, will finally be available on the North American 3DS eShop on March 20th, according to publisher Natsume:

This is the first time the series has ever ventured outside of Japan in its 2-decade history, but Natsume has expressed in interviews its desire to bring the latest game to overseas fans, and that digital distribution has been seen as a good way of helping lower the risks and costs involved.

The titular protagonist of Yumi's Odd Odyssey wields a fishing line and hook, swinging, flinging, and navigating herself through a multitude of levels. The series has drawn a cult following of fans outside Japan who came across its unique style in various ways, including a playthrough of the original Super Famicom title on GameCenter CX. No official word has been given regarding a potential release of Yumi's Odd Odyssey in Europe or Australia.

Will you bite on Yumi's Odd Odyssey, or is it just not hooking you? Let us know in the comments.

Sheltair's new $25 million hangar-office complex now open

Aviation development company Sheltair will celebrate the grand-opening of its new $25 million westside office-hangar complex at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport Wednesday, Nov. 13. In October, Sheltair completed the 134,806 square foot facility on more than 11 acres of land on the west side of the airfield, as part of a three-phase development project. (Arlene Satchell)

The roughly $25 million complex marks the completion of the first phase of a three-part development project at the Fort Lauderdale facility that's expected to be done in 2015, Sheltair said.

The aviation development company, which has 20 airport facilities in Florida, New York and Georgia, provides fuel, ground handling and other services to owners and operators of corporate and leisure aircraft. It also builds and leases hangars and office space to aviation-related companies.

"Sheltair strives to be on the cutting edge of aviation construction and development, and this project coupled with the advantages and growth potential at this airport is and will be a wonderful example in the aviation community," Sheltair CEO Jerry Holland said in a statement.

Work on the 134,806-square-foot facility at 1470 Lee Wagener Blvd. was completed in October after breaking ground in April 2012. Spread across more than 11 acres, the complex is the first new general aviation facility to be built on the airport's west side in more than a decade, according to Sheltair.

Increased demand for its services, customers' expanding fleets and the Fort Lauderdale airport's rising international profile were among reasons for the expansion, company officials have said. Sheltair is also seeking to grow its business from Brazil, Mexico, Canada and Europe.

"We are pleased Sheltair Aviation has decided to expand their facilities at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport," said Kent George, the airport's director of aviation.

Beside its traditional services, Sheltair also manages the country's busiest general aviation federal inspection station for international flights here in Fort Lauderdale, George noted.

Tenants in the new facility will have access to Sheltair's round-the-clock terminal, which offers aircraft refueling, cleaning, a 24-hour U.S. Customs office, Hertz car rental, cafe and executive boardroom and other amenities. They'll also have direct access to the airport's new 8,000-foot south runway, now under construction and set to open September 2014.

I ask because I have just ordered some laying pullets expecting chicks on the 28th and today found one of my hens who has been slacking big time on the egg production on the nest. I thought nothing of it and came back later to collect her egg; She was gone from the nest but she had pulled off alot of feathers and looks like she is getting ready to brood. It's bad timing of coarse with all the chicks on the way but maybe I will put a few of my Light Brahma x silkie eggs under her and see if they will hatch. That way if she decides to leave the nest after a few days I won't be so disappointed.

ShinBit is receiving a Melarsomine injection to kill the adult heartworms. So Melarsomine is an adulticide and is the Immiticide referred to in the heartworm treatment report.. Remember the adult worms can live in the heart and pulmonary arteries which is why heartworms get their name. Melarsomine is the only medication currently being used to kill adult heartworms. Because it is injected into the muscles of the back, the injections can be painful.. Doxycycline is also used to kill the Wolbachia organism infection that often accompanies heartworm disease. This organism is thought to also provide some sort of protection for adult heartworms and may cause inflammation in the lungs of the infected animal after the adult heartworms die.. The dying heartworms can cause obstructions in the blood vessels of the lungs. Exercise can increase the risk of an embolism and serious side effects so ShinBi must be kept quiet and inactive during his heartworm treatment.

WILL I HAVE TO EAT AND DRINK THINGS THAT I DON'T LIKE AND TAKE A LOT OF SUPPLEMENTS?

No! You'll never have to eat anything you don't like. But, you'll be encouraged to discover foods that support and nourish you. Over time your taste buds will change and you will start seeking out these foods naturally. With regards to food and drinks it's about switching to healthier options that are right for your body type, as opposed to whatever it is you may have been eating before. But, it's not about perfection - you'll learn to still enjoy 'treat' foods now and again without any bingeing or guilt.

You’ll never be pressured to take any supplements that are suggested to you.

​

CAN I DO THIS IF I HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION?

​

If you have a medical condition, then I recommend sharing the information with your physician/doctor. You can always adjust the meals to accommodate your health needs.

​

Note: This is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

I AM UNABLE TO EAT DAIRY OR GLUTEN AND HAVE OTHER FOOD INTOLERANCES, WILL THIS AFFECT MY ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE?

Not at all. You can list foods that you don't like or have an intolerance to and this is all incorporated into your profile. No matter what your eating habits look like now, this plan will help you to make them better.

​

HOW DOES THIS COURSE RUN?

The first session is creating your online profile and determining your body type through bone measurements and questionnaires. This usually takes one and half hours. After that it is an hour long one on one coaching session every fortnight. We can meet in person, online or over the phone - what ever suits you.

​

WHAT IF I FEEL TOO BUSY TO DO EVERYTHING?

Response of Triatoma infestans to pour-on cypermethrin applied to chickens under laboratory conditions.
This article reports the effects of a pour-on formulation of cypermethrin (6% active ingredient) applied to chickens exposed to Triatoma infestans, the main vector of Chagas disease in rural houses of the Gran Chaco Region of South America. This study was designed as a completely random experiment with three experimental groups and five replicates. Third instar nymphs were fed on chickens treated with 0, 1 and 2 cc of the formulation. Nymphs were allowed to feed on the chickens at different time intervals after the insecticide application. Third-instar nymphs fed on treated chickens showed a higher mortality, took less blood during feeding and had a lower moulting rate. The mortality rate was highest seven days after the insecticide solution application and blood intake was affected until 30 days after the application of the solution.

Allergy and Asthma: Allergic Rhinitis and Allergic Conjunctivitis.
Allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis are among the most common conditions seen in family medicine practice. Most cases are due to seasonal allergens, such as pollens, or year-round allergens, such as dust mites, mold, and animal dander. The clinical diagnosis can be made when symptoms of nasal congestion, sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal or ocular pruritus, or eye tearing are present along with physical findings, such as clear rhinorrhea, pale nasal mucosa, or red watery eyes. Patients should be assessed for any comorbid conditions, such as asthma or eczema, and for symptoms that indicate impaired quality of life, such as poor sleep, daytime somnolence, or irritability. Prevention involves allergen avoidance and environmental controls. Monotherapy with oral antihistamines, intranasal steroids, or intranasal antihistamines are the initial management options for nasal and ocular symptoms. Antihistamine eye drops are fast-acting and safe for management of ocular symptoms; intranasal antihistamines are effective for nasal symptoms. Current guidelines recommend against combining intranasal steroids and oral antihistamines, as this provides no additional benefit. Select patients also may benefit from allergy skin testing or consideration for allergen immunotherapy.

Semiconductor chip power is typically supplied on-chip at a single, predetermined voltage level. Chip designers typically specify a single, predetermined voltage level for reasons of standardization and convenience. Accordingly, as chip standards migrate from one on-chip voltage level to another, difficulties arise during transition periods. During such times of transition, new chips designed to operate at voltage levels according to the new standard voltage level may desirably be mounted on circuit boards and be incorporated into electronic systems designed to operate at the former standard voltage level.
Unfortunately, semiconductor chips designed to the new standard voltage will not generally make provision to accommodate the voltage level previously widely recognized and followed. It is typically presumed that either the entire electronics system into which the new chip design is to be incorporated will operate at the new voltage level, or that some off-chip solution will be provided to create voltage compatibility between subsystems and chips operating at separate voltage level.
Additionally, in the general case, a chip which operates at a given voltage level is not able to recognize that it has been provided with a nonstandard voltage level. There has been a failure of semiconductor chip designers to provide an on-chip solution for power provided at an arbitrary voltage level to be automatically converted to a desired internal operating voltage level. This creates serious compatibility problems for the semiconductor industry daring a period of accelerating miniaturization.
This increased miniaturization of chip geometries in the semiconductor industry makes it increasingly necessary to develop new solutions and chip designs which can accommodate a plurality of on-chip voltage levels. One aspect of the trend toward miniaturization is the use of increasingly thin gate oxide layers for CMOS devices fabricated in the industry. This has resulted in an increased recent motivation and an urgent need for semiconductor circuits to be able to accommodate both 5.0 volt and 3.3 volt on-chip voltage levels. It is anticipated that in the near future even lower on-chip voltage levels, such as for example 2.2 volts and 1.1 volts are likely to develop into the required circuit design norm.
It is accordingly an object of the invention herein to provide an on-chip voltage conversion solution for semiconductor chips manufactured during technology transition periods in which the semiconductor industry worldwide converts from one standard internal semiconductor chip voltage level to another.
It is an object of the invention herein to develop semiconductor circuit chips which are operable at a plurality of internal semiconductor chip voltage levels.
It is yet another object of the invention herein to provide an on-chip semiconductor design approach which converts internal voltage levels from a standard 5.0 voltage level to 3.3 volts.

Q:

central limit theorem VS standard deviation of multiple group means

I understand that we can estimate confidence interval of sample mean using CLT. However, I am wondering if we could treat mean value of each sampled group data as a single data entry and estimate their standard deviation to finish this calculation? Or where is wrong about this approach? An example,
If I have the following 4 groups of measurements, which follows normal distribution with mean=30, stand deviation=10. 
    group_mean  group_sd Ob1     Ob2     Ob3    Ob4     Ob5
group1  33.43   5.92    30.24   43.15   27.49   32.98   33.30
group2  28.92   11.04   32.42   38.83   32.14   31.32   9.91
group3  26.53   7.18    19.34   22.86   33.37   35.11   21.95
group4  28.26   7.43    21.09   28.13   23.19   40.24   28.66

If I treat each group mean as a data point (33.43, 28.92, 26.53, 28.26) and the mean is 29.29 and standard deviation (sample) is 2.94.
So can I assume the confidence interval of sample mean = 29.29 +/- t*2.94??
Thanks in advance!

A:

Theoretically, the standard error is the standard deviation for the sampling distribution.  In this case, what you have proposed is to sample from the sampling distribution 4 times (obtaining 4 means). The standard deviation of these values should provide an approximation for the standard deviation of the sampling distribution...i.e., the standard error. Conceptually, if you are using the correct $t$-distribution (using the correct degrees of freedom), it seems as though this should produce a reasonable result.
Follow-up
I am not convinced this strategy will work unless the correct degrees of freedom are used for the grouped means data set. Here is a brief simulation that shows that you obtain about 2% incorrect conclusions with a 98% confidence interval treating the data as an aggregate data set. But using the group means with different critical values does not produce the same results:

### set random seed
set.seed(1234)
### formula for CI:  x-bar ± t.cv * SD/√n
### t_cv for 98% confidence interval with df=19 (and others)
t.cv <- qt(1-0.02/2,19)
t.cv2 <- qt(1-0.02/2,4)
t.cv3 <- qt(1-0.02/2,16)
### generate data sets with mean 50 and stdev 10
n.sim <- 10^5
check.TF.1 <- rep.int(NA,n.sim)
check.TF.2 <- check.TF.1
check.TF.3 <- check.TF.1
check.TF.4 <- check.TF.1
grps <- ceiling({1:20}/5)
for(i in 1:n.sim) {
   x <- rnorm(20,50,10)
   grp.Ms <- aggregate(x~grps,FUN="mean")[,2]
   CI <- mean(x) + c(-1,1)*t.cv*sd(x)/sqrt(20)

Have you ever watched how contagious a yawn is? If one person in a group yawns, the entire group joins in. This can be explained by empathy. Lack of empathy is the key characteristic that distinguishes a true, pathological, dangerous narcissist, from someone that is just really, really, arrogant.

The same area of the brain is activated in yawn contagion as is activated by empathy. Autistic children, for instance, do not show yawn contagion. Is it possible, that narcissists do not shown yawn contagion either?

I need your help with this. This is what I would like you to do.

1. In a group of average people, friends, co-workers or in line at the store, fake a deep long yawn and then pay attention to how many people yawn as well. This is the control, the first step. It is important to know that your fake yawn works with normal people.

2. If the step above does not result in other people yawning, work on your yawn until it is contagious reliably.

3. Yawn, in a way that you know elicits others to yawn with someone that you know is a narcissist. Observe their response.

4. Report back here, yes or no, whether or not known narcissists have yawn contagion.

One final appeal. This would be an incredibly useful and handy tool if it is accurate. What we don’t know right now is if it is accurate, so I would like you to try it. I know that many of you know narcissists! Please try this. If we had a simple, socially acceptable tool for pre-screening people for narcissism, think of how much simpler our lives would be.

Happy Yawning…

Doors of the European Union (EU) are open for Montenegro- this is what the President of European Parliament Antonio Tajani told in an interview with the public broadcaster of Montenegro (TVCG).

Montenegro is the leader among countries wishing to join the EU and that should happen in 7 years, Tajani also said. “We love Montenegro and we want to cooperate with it. Our doors are open for Montenegro.”

Despite challenges the EU has been recently facing (e.g. the next-year election, Brexit, migrant crisis and the enlargement policy), Tajani hopes our country will join the EU by 2025.

“We have 7 years more. Montenegro could become the full EU member state if only we worked hard. We also have to improve the stability of the EU. Montenegro is a frontrunner for 2025 EU membership,” Tajani told.

The European Parliament President emphasizes our country plays a key role for the stability of the Western Balkans, which is also very important for the stability of the EU.

Two Healthy Diets Modulate Gut Microbial Community Improving Insulin Sensitivity in a Human Obese Population.
Gut microbiota, which acts collectively as a fully integrated organ in the host metabolism, can be shaped by long-term dietary interventions after a specific diet. The aim was to study the changes in microbiota after 1 year's consumption of a Mediterranean diet (Med diet) or a low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet (LFHCC diet) in an obese population. Participants were randomized to receive the Med diet (35% fat, 22% monounsaturated) and the LFHCC diet (28% fat, 12% monounsaturated). The study was conducted in 20 obese patients (men) within the Coronary Diet Intervention With Olive Oil and Cardiovascular Prevention (CORDIOPREV) study, an ongoing prospective, randomized, opened, controlled trial in patients with coronary heart disease. We evaluated the bacterial composition and its relationship with the whole fecal and plasma metabolome. The LFHCC diet increased the Prevotella and decreased the Roseburia genera, whereas the Med diet decreased the Prevotella and increased the Roseburia and Oscillospira genera (P = .028, .002, and .016, respectively). The abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis (P = .025) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P = .020) increased after long-term consumption of the Med diet and the LFHCC diet, respectively. The changes in the abundance of 7 of 572 metabolites found in feces, including mainly amino acid, peptide, and sphingolipid metabolism, could be linked to the changes in the gut microbiota. Our results suggest that long-term consumption of the Med and LFHCC diets exerts a protective effect on the development of type 2 diabetes by different specific changes in the gut microbiota, increasing the abundance of the Roseburia genus and F. prausnitzii, respectively.

The Arabidopsis arenosa complex is closely related to the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Species and subspecies in the complex are mainly biennial, predominantly outcrossing, herbaceous, and with a distribution range covering most parts of latitudes and the eastern reaches of Europe. In this study we present the first comprehensive evolutionary history of the A. arenosa species complex, covering its natural range, by using chromosome counts, nuclear AFLP data, and a maternally inherited marker from the chloroplast genome [trnL intron (trnL) and trnL/F intergenic spacer (trnL/F-IGS) of tRNALeu and tRNAPhe, respectively]. We unravel the broad-scale cytogeographic and phylogeographic patterns of diploids and tetraploids. Diploid cytotypes were exclusively found on the Balkan Peninsula and in the Carpathians while tetraploid cytotypes were found throughout the remaining distribution range of the A. arenosa complex. Three centers of genetic diversity were identified: the Balkan Peninsula, the Carpathians, and the unglaciated Eastern and Southeastern Alps. All three could have served as long-term refugia during Pleistocene climate oscillations. We hypothesize that the Western Carpathians were and still are the cradle of speciation within the A. arenosa complex due to the high species number and genetic diversity and the concurrence of both cytotypes there.

Like many kids who grew up in the ’70s, Simon Pegg was always a fan of Star Trek. But he never imagined that one day, he would get to play a main character and act alongside one of his idols.

Simon Pegg landed the role of a lifetime when he became the new Scotty in the latest Star Trek series. But for the actor, his memories of Star Trek as a child were much different from those that others had. Pegg told MTV that he became a fan as a young boy, but not by watching the original series with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy.

The British actor said he learned to love the story through an animated series in the 1970s that came out after the original show ended.

“I was watching that before I saw the live-action show in the very early ’70s and then watching the original TV show in ’78 or ’79 when I was on holiday. BBC2 used to show it at 6 o’clock every night, so I’d watch it while I had my dinner,” Pegg said. “I used to just love it because it was this strange, odd, kind of thoughtful show that was all about sci-fi, which I love. I have very strong memories of it as a child.”

That inspired child grew up to be a successful actor and filmmaker, but nothing could compare to meeting one of his childhood heroes. Pegg was one of the only Spock fans who got to meet the actual character.

“What was weird was actually getting to act with Leonard Nimoy and acting with a character that I’ve known since I was a kid, not just the actor, but the character,” he said. “When Spock spoke to me as Spock, it was mind blowing.”

Pegg’s film The World’s End is in theaters now. He teamed up with actors he has worked with on many of his other films, including Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead.

The World’s End is about childhood friends getting older and going home again. Pegg said it came at the right time, and he is glad they waited to make the film they have been thinking about for years.

“I don’t think we could have made the film when we had the idea, because we needed another six years of living in order to say what we wanted to say,” he told The New York Times back in August.

The World’s End has already pulled in nearly $40 million worldwide. Star Trek Into Darkness is now available on Blu-ray and DVD.

"Mortal man," he said, "denounce the rulers of Israel. Prophesy to them, and tell them what I, the Sovereign Lord, say to them: You are doomed, you shepherds of Israel! You take care of yourselves, but never tend the sheep.

3
You drink the milk, wear clothes made from the wool, and kill and eat the finest sheep. But you never tend the sheep.

4
You have not taken care of the weak ones, healed the ones that are sick, bandaged the ones that are hurt, brought back the ones that wandered off, or looked for the ones that were lost. Instead, you treated them cruelly.

5
Because the sheep had no shepherd, they were scattered, and wild animals killed and ate them. 1

6
So my sheep wandered over the high hills and the mountains. They were scattered over the face of the earth, and no one looked for them or tried to find them.

7
"Now, you shepherds, listen to what I, the Lord, am telling you.

8
As surely as I am the living God, you had better listen to me. My sheep have been attacked by wild animals that killed and ate them because there was no shepherd. My shepherds did not try to find the sheep. They were taking care of themselves and not the sheep.

9
So listen to me, you shepherds.

10
I, the Sovereign Lord, declare that I am your enemy. I will take my sheep away from you and never again let you be their shepherds; never again will I let you take care only of yourselves. I will rescue my sheep from you and not let you eat them.

11
"I, the Sovereign Lord, tell you that I myself will look for my sheep and take care of them

12
in the same way as shepherds take care of their sheep that were scattered and are brought together again. I will bring them back from all the places where they were scattered on that dark, disastrous day.

13
I will take them out of foreign countries, gather them together, and bring them back to their own land. I will lead them back to the mountains and the streams of Israel and will feed them in pleasant pastures.

14
I will let them graze in safety in the mountain meadows and the valleys and in all the green pastures of the land of Israel.

15
I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will find them a place to rest. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken.

16
"I will look for those that are lost, bring back those that wander off, bandage those that are hurt, and heal those that are sick; but those that are fat and strong I will destroy, because I am a shepherd who does what is right.

17
"Now then, my flock, I, the Sovereign Lord, tell you that I will judge each of you and separate the good from the bad, the sheep from the goats.

18
Some of you are not satisfied with eating the best grass; you even trample down what you don't eat! You drink the clear water and muddy what you don't drink!

19
My other sheep have to eat the grass you trample down and drink the water you muddy.

20
"So now, I, the Sovereign Lord, tell you that I will judge between you strong sheep and the weak sheep.

21
You pushed the sick ones aside and butted them away from the flock.

22
But I will rescue my sheep and not let them be mistreated any more. I will judge each of my sheep and separate the good from the bad.

23
I will give them a king like my servant David to be their one shepherd, and he will take care of them. 2

24
I, the Lord, will be their God, and a king like my servant David will be their ruler. I have spoken. 3

25
I will make a covenant with them that guarantees their security. I will get rid of all the dangerous animals in the land, so that my sheep can live safely in the fields and sleep in the forests.

26
"I will bless them and let them live around my sacred hill. There I will bless them with showers of rain when they need it.

27
The trees will bear fruit, the fields will produce crops, and everyone will live in safety on his own land. When I break my people's chains and set them free from those who made them slaves, then they will know that I am the Lord.

28
The heathen nations will not plunder them any more, and the wild animals will not kill and eat them. They will live in safety, and no one will terrify them.

29
I will give them fertile fields and put an end to hunger in the land. The other nations will not sneer at them any more.

30
Everyone will know that I protect Israel and that they are my people. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken.

31
"You, my sheep, the flock that I feed, are my people, and I am your God," says the Sovereign Lord.

Café Yumm!

Café Yumm! is a fast casual restaurant chain with outlets in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.

Founded in Eugene, Oregon, Café Yumm! outlets focus on fast, casual, cheap, and healthy cuisine, and some menu items feature the company's original signature sauce.

History
Café Yumm! was founded in 1997 when owners Mary Ann and Mark Beauchamp converted their unsuccessful juice bar into a fast casual restaurant. Central to the new menu were the Yumm! Bowl and its Yumm! Sauce, both developed earlier by Mary Ann Beauchamp at her former restaurant, Wild Rose Café & Deli. The company opened a second location in Eugene in 1999 and a third in 2002, and in 2007 the company began to franchise. The chain grew to 15 locations by 2015, with two franchises in Bend, Oregon. 

The chain opened its 23rd location in Eagle, Idaho, in February, 2019, as part of a three-outlet plan that includes two future Boise locations.

Estimated annual revenue for the company is $10.1 million with an estimate of 54 employees.

Menu
The Café Yumm! menu consists of five categories: three sizes of rice bowls layered with organic beans, Yumm! Sauce, and Deluxe Toppings (shredded Tillamook® cheddar cheese, tomatoes, avocado, sour cream, black olives, and cilantro), sandwiches and wraps, salads, soups, and bentos. More than 50 percent of the food served at Café Yumm! restaurants is certified organic.

Yumm! Sauce 
Café Yumm! co-founder Mary Ann Beauchamp developed the recipe for Yumm! Sauce in the 1980's. The company's original signature sauce is made with a base of almonds, garbanzo beans, soy beans, lemon juice, oil, herbs, and nutritional yeast. The sauce is used on a variety of menu items at Café Yumm! restaurants and a commercial version of the sauce is sold in over 160 grocery stores throughout the Pacific Northwest and through the company's online store.

Reception and Awards

Café Yumm! has been named The Register-Guard's Readers’ Choice for "Best Lunch Bargain" and "Favorite Vegetarian" in readers' polls many times since 2009. The company was also recognized as "Most Environmentally Friendly Business" in 2009. Café Yumm! has been named in the Eugene Weekly's "Best Of" for a variety of awards including "Best Vegetarian", "Best Eats Under $8", and "Best Cheap Eats" from 2014 to 2018. 

QSR Magazine included Café Yumm! in the 2018 40/40 List of America's Hottest Startup Fast Casuals.

The basic hypothesis of this proposal is that the ability of alpha adrenergic agonists to stimulate the Na+ pump of vascular smooth muscle may be related to the activation of Na+ influx and/or intracellular Ca++ release which are alpha1-mediated events or the influx of extracellular Ca++ which is an alpha2-mediated event. The project will be aimed at investigating this hypothesis in both quiescent and proliferating cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. These culture systems may serve as a model of normal, differentiated vascular cells (quiescent) or as a model of certain disease states such as atherosclerosis or hypertension in which cells are proliferating. Cells maintained under quiescent or proliferating conditions will be characterized with respect to Na+ pump number by quantitating [3H]-ouabain binding, turnover rate of the Na+ pump by measuring ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake and numbers of alpha1 and alpha2 receptors by [3H]-prazosin and [3H]-yohimbine binding. After control values for each of these parameters have been determined, the short-term effects of selective alpha1 and alpha2 agonists and antagonists on Na+ pump rate will be monitored. The role of a particular receptor subtype or subtypes will be assesed by comparison of relative potencies of selective agonists and pA2 values of selective antagonists. A primary effect of alpha agonists in all cells possessing alpha receptors is the mobilization of extracellular or intracellular Ca++. Experiments will be performed to determine the role of Ca++ in alpha-mediated stimulation of the Na+ pump by manipulating these pools of Ca++ and observing the effects on alpha-mediated pump stimulation. An alternative mechanism may be an alpha-stimulated Na+ influx related to the activation of a membrane Na+-H+ exchanger. This possibility will be investigated by measuring changes in [Na+]i by flame photometry and [pH]i by uptake of the weak acid [14C]-DMO in the presence of selective alpha agonists and antagonists. It is also planned to assess the effect on Na+ pump parameters of long term incubations of vascular smooth muscle cells with alpha agonists. In addition, alpha receptor number will also be monitored. It is expected that significant data will be obtained regarding the control of active and passive ion movements in vascular smooth muscle. In view of the role that disturbances of ionic regulation are believed to play in hypertension, it is anticipated that these studies may contribute to the understanding of this disease process.

I've got Mongolia on my mind too.. I've spent 12 years living and studying in the US. Now I come to the conclusion that I should go back to Mongolia and contribute to its development through what I have learned in American schools. However, I am anxious about going back. One of the major fears that I have about going back is that there is a system in Mongolia that does not value academic and professional merit but promotes the power of connections and "buying" job posts. What would you advise to those like me who are contemplating a return to our homeland and pursue professional careers there? Thank you.

Joey Rosskopf (BMC Racing) won his second straight time trial title at the USA Cycling Pro Road Championships on Thursday in Knoxville, Tennessee.. The 28-year-old was strong throughout course, three laps of an 11.4-kilometer circuit totaling 34.2 kilometers. He set the fastest times at the early checkpoints and held on to finish with the day’s fastest mark of 39:46.. Sunweb’s Chad Haga finished second, 28 seconds down.. “I couldn’t have asked for better legs. It was pretty hard to match Chad Haga’s time on the first lap especially,” Rosskopf said. “I felt like I had the advantage to know the time checks, to base my own ride off of them. The only option to win is to go out and match the times and do better. If you fade, at least you tried. Luckily I felt good enough to do that.”. Brent Bookwalter gave BMC a third podium finisher, 34 seconds back.. Aevolo Cycling’s Gage Hecht delivered the fifth fastest time, two minutes down on Rosskopf, to finish as the day’s best-placed under-23 rider.

I.). Bueno, welcome to my new design! Hopefully, you’ll get to like it as I have. I based it on the theme called "Identity". The original, however, wasn’t fully compatible with WP2.5 — and it looked rather plain as is — so I had had to do some major recoding on the templates.. I did love my old theme very much ("Subtle for WordPress" by GluedIdeas), so here’s a tribute to it: a screen-capture of the blog just before I started upgrading WordPress and installing & tweaking the new theme.. Congrats Kuya Blogie.. Anyway, check out your screenshot’s MyBlogLog widget; I’m your latest visitor!. Hahaha.. Thanks, Mikko!. @Mikko – di ah.. ako ang latest.. check mo ulit.. hehe. ay sa screenshot pala. sorry ^_^

Epic are releasing a massive update to Fortnite’s Battle Royale map, splitting it up into different biomes and adding new types of play spaces, such as multi-story buildings and labyrinthine tunnel networks.

The map update is coming this week, but Epic can’t say which exact day it will arrive yet.

You can see some footage of the updated map in the developer diary posted last week:

Epic launched Fortnite’s Battle Royale mode back in September with a map the team knew they could improve. “One of the things we wanted to do to make it better was to add more points of interest to the map,” lead level designer David Spalinski tells me. “Points of interest act as areas for players to congregate and meet and fight over various weapons and other types of valuable loot. They’re also an opportunity to add unique elements of gameplay, specific to that particular point of interest.”

Spalinski isn’t talking about adding in new systems and mechanics, but how spaces themselves can drive different kinds of play. “We have a new point of interest called Tilted Towers that is a city area, [which adds] a unique style of gameplay by having taller buildings and a higher density of locations. Each building is kind of like a labyrinth and they’re all close to each other.”

Another lead level designer, Sidney Rauchberger, points to a new area called Shifty Shafts that “adds a contrasting kind of gameplay.” Rauchberger explains that is “essentially an underground mine. It’s very windy, it’s got a lot of close quarters, tight angles, it’s darker. It’s frantic.”

These new kinds of spaces will infuse the Battle Royale mode with a greater variety of play and, considering the way the map closes down as the circle of death shrinks, this can significantly affect how the late-game plays out. “Because the circle is going to determine where you will end,” Rauchberger says, “you’re going to be pushed into some interesting scenarios that will force you to adapt your style of play – games ending in the maze are going to be very tense.”

The new biomes, which see the map split into swamp, grasslands, farms, and mountains, aren’t just to give more visual variety, but also to give players the tools to better orientate themselves.

“You start to gain a little bit of memory,” Spalinski says, “like ‘Oh, I’m in the mountain area, that means I’m on the western side of the map’, or ‘I’m in the swamp areas, that means I’m on the southern side of the map’. It helps give you a sense of place.”

The team also took the opportunity to redress the current points of interest on the map. “A lot of that refreshing came from playing the game with the community, listening to their feedback, reading on the internet what people had to say about certain areas that they may love or hate,” Spalinski says. “People like to go to certain areas a lot of times or stay away from others, and we like to see why that is and try to make them a little it better.”

With that feedback in mind the team made minor adjustments to a number of locations, making them more appealing. “It could be as small as ‘Hey, this area doesn’t have enough ammo, it would be great if I didn’t have to leave it to keep fighting other people’. We listened to that kind of feedback and looked at and balanced the areas so they’re creating the kind of gameplay that our users desire.”

Epic say the update is only possible because of improvements they’ve made to how the engine streams in content. “Before we had to fit everything in at once,” Rauchberger says, “now we’re able to allocate more resources because we’re able to split up the world better.”

It also means that there is the possibility that Epic will do a similar scale of update to the map in the future. “We’re always trying to see if there’s space to continue to improve,” Spalinski says. “When we released initially, internally, we felt without our new streaming technology that there were certain things we were incapable of doing […] and there were certain things we didn’t know needed to be done until it was out there […] and the community had played it and it was just going to take a little it of time to collect the things we didn’t know.

“This map update addresses some of the things that we wanted to do and some of things we learned along the way. We’re most likely going to be able to repeat that process of learning about what we’re about to release and where the opportunities as a result of that and the community will be able to inform us to some degree.”

Sober Blood

Twenty-two years for a plastic chip
That says how long ago I quit
Don’t tell the truth that’ll never change
I still want to everyday

I gave up what was once my life
A family–my kids, my wife
And don’t you know not a day goes by
When I ain’t trying to make it right

If I’d only known all of the things that I know now
I can’t help but wonder how my life would have turned out
I might die alone although the papers may not show
That the sober blood of a good man is gone

I ain’t missed one of them meetings since
The day that I signed up for this
But the lessons learned won’t ever heal the pain
Of a family still suffering

On my knees, I ask the Lord
Questions that He’s heard before
Just what can I do for forgiveness now?
I ask of You this final hour

If I’d only known all of the things that I know now
I can’t help but wonder how my life would have turned out
I might die alone although the papers may not show
That the sober blood of a good man is gone

Here I stand at Heaven’s doors
Wondering why, not really sure
Then I hear a voice calling out my name
I guess it’s true that Jesus saves

If I’d only known all of the things that I know now
I can’t help but wonder how my life would have turned out
I might die alone although the papers may not show
That the sober blood of a good man is gone

Robert Kugler, with Bella

Robert Kugler, with Bella

Cruising through the streets of Philadelphia and exploring the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.

Rolling around a park in Cleveland.

Watching the water flow at Niagara Falls.

Standing atop a rock in the Adirondack Mountains in New York.

Hanging out at Harvard; chilling in front of Boston's Fenway Park.

It was the worst possible news you could get about your best buddy.

Bone cancer, so a leg is amputated. But it gets worse. The cancer’s spread to the lungs. Now it’s a terminal condition.

So what do you do?

Robert Kugler decide to take his best friend — a three-legged chocolate lab named Bella — on one last, legendary ride.

“This is one of the biggest connections I’ve ever had to another living being. I don’t care that it’s a dog,” said Kugler, who’s from Broken Bow, Nebraska.

A devastating diagnosis

Kugler found out last year that Bella was dying of cancer. He had adopted her as a puppy nine years ago and wasn’t anyway ready to let her go.

“I just didn’t want her to be gone one day when I came home,” he said.

So Kugler began with Bella a trip of a lifetime. Kugler’s a Marine vet, so they headed off to Chicago back in November to the Marine Corps Ball.

His social media feeds — Twitter, Facebook and Instagram — documented their travels as they headed from there to points east and south:

Bella posing in front of a mural in Detroit

getting petted by some Salvation Army bell ringers in Bowling Green, Kentucky

checking out the sunset over Lake Erie

rolling around a park in Cleveland

Watching the water flow at Niagara Falls

standing atop a rock in the Adirondack Mountains in New York

hanging out at Harvard; chilling in front of Boston’s Fenway Park

cruising through the streets of Philadelphia and exploring the Lincoln Memorial in Washington

Bella and Kugler have either camped out in his Toyota 4Runner or couch-surfed with his friends along the way. Kugler’s doing this trip, not just for Bella, but for others too.

“I want to inspire people to get outside and live,” he said. “Love each other for who we are and make friends.”

They’re now in Florida, on the Gulf coast side, enjoying St. Petersburg and the white sand beach in Siesta Key. Well, not totally enjoying them, since the Sunshine State’s intense heat is pretty rough on Bella.

“The cold is easier to combat with a dog than the heat,” Kugler joked. He says the waters are so warm in Florida right now that they’re not exactly “refreshing” to her.

So now Kugler’s thinking of heading west, stopping for a bit back home in Nebraska before introducing Bella to the nation’s majestic national parks, like Yellowstone and Yosemite. He hasn’t really planned it out with too much detail. And that’s part of the charm of this long goodbye.

“Continuing to move and see the country is a good excuse to spend time with my dog,” he said. Being spontaneous can sometimes be a headache, since it means spending a huge amount of time “figuring out where we’re going to sleep,” but it also means enjoying unplanned little adventures.

“You come across a little gravel road and wonder, ‘where does this go?'” So you make the turn and find out, Kugler said.

The greatest gift

Doctors gave Bella just six three to six months left to live last year; she’s survived much longer than that, but Kugler knows Bella’s time is drawing short. He said a few weeks ago, he watched her, playing in the waters on a beach and envisioned a peaceful end for her.

“Some days I’m completely prepared. I pictured her just swimming out to sea,” he said. “But there’s other days when I’m like, oh my God, I can’t bear the thought of it.”

But whenever and wherever it happens, he’ll be with her. It’s part of the job of being best buds with a dog.

“We take on these animals, which means we’re gonna take on their life and their passing,” Kugler said. “To be there with them when they pass is the greatest gift you can give anybody.”

When Bella’s gone Kugler said he’ll volunteer more, like he has in the past for organizations that help veterans, like Team Rubicon and Team Red, White & Blue. And yes, he’ll continue to hit the open road.

“I want the freedom to travel. I don’t want a home that’ll keep me in one spot.”

Until then, Kugler thinks we should all be a little more like Bella: “Wag more; bark less.”

My work stems from process. I enjoy learning new techniques and manipulating them in new ways. I work on a broad range of projects including clothing, upholstery, restoration, jewellery, painting and sculpture. I find that by keeping my practice broad different ideas feed into each other to produce more interesting results.. I also aim to make my work as sustainable as possible. I want my products to be cherished and cared for and to make people feel happy. I feel that texture and attention to detail play a part in this as they help people to feel connected to an object. Quality is also a major factor in the life span of a product so I try to ensure the best workmanship in all that I make.. I grew up on Telegraph Hill and I enjoy the chance to take part in community projects such as the Hill Station.

Tasting Notes. Opici Homemade Style Barberone White is a full bodied wine made from a blend of white grapes. The wine has a full, slightly sweet floral aroma.

The Lawi overshoes made from lycra provide the cyclist with an aerodynamic advantage. The overshoes are very light weighted and due to the used fabrics, the shoe cover fits perfectly around your cycling shoe. On the underside of the product, a recess is applied to let the heel and the cleat come out of the overshoe.. In addition, to provide an aerodynamic advantage, the product also protects your cycling shoes against dirt. This is ideal for mountain biking or cycling during bad weather conditions. The product is therefore easy to wash out.

. Step over the stile into a world that no one knows exists. A world that overturns everything you know about the goodness of people and creates a mirror image of evil. Five years about I found this true story haunting, today I find it just as compelling. What you will see is the worst catastrophe you can imagine. When a young girl comes into a police station and claims her father is having sex with her, the authorities have no idea how big this situation is and how pervasive it is in the culture of a group of people that call themselves the Goler Clan. And it is not just a single act on one person but a whole series of crimes committed generation to generation. Truly there is no explanation that can be found, no escape from the depravity. The idyllic charm of the Annapolis Valley is penetrated by Evil so strong you can taste as you read. It enters your heart and mind never to let it go.

Construction News

A proposal to build a new 120-bed hospital in Albuquerque may be altered to allow for a smaller facility due to budgetary considerations.

After months of review and discussion, members of the University of New Mexico’s Board of Regents last summer agreed to let a project to build a new hospital advance to the design phase.

As proposed, the project would also include half a dozen operating rooms and clinical offices.

Initial plans additionally called for the hospital to be built on land owned by UNM just northeast of the University Boulevard and Lomas Boulevard intersection.

But now, some seven months after that vote, Dr. Paul Roth, UNM Health Sciences Center’s chancellor, has suggested a smaller facility may be more in order.

During a recent regents’ meeting, Roth said that although the need for more hospital beds remains unchanged, the university should conduct further studies before proceeding with what is anticipated to be a project that could cost as much as $250 million.

So far, the school has reserved some $200 million to build the hospital.

The project was earlier regarded as only the first phase in the eventual construction of a $684 million hospital with just over 400 beds.

UNM officials have long maintained that a new hospital is especially needed not just because it would provide more bed space, but also because the current structure built in the 1950s is no longer adequate for the hospital’s needs.

Telomere length and its relationship with chronic diseases - new perspectives for periodontal research.
The ageing process is accompanied by a variety of cellular modifications, and telomere shortening is a common finding. Large epidemiological studies have reported an association between shorter telomere length in peripheral leukocytes and several inflammatory diseases of the elderly including diabetes, atherosclerosis and, recently, periodontitis. The primary aim of this study was to critically discuss available evidence regarding the potential mechanisms relating shorter telomeres to periodontitis. A narrative literature review was performed to report evidence relating shorter telomeres to the ageing process and inflammation. Then, we searched MEDLINE (1950 to May 2012) and ISI WEB OF SCIENCE (1950 to May 2012) databases for the combination of the terms 'telomere' and 'periodontitis'. Although these associations suggest a possible role of telomere attrition in the onset or evolution of chronic inflammatory diseases, only two studies addressed the relationship between telomere length and periodontitis. We suggest that the chronic inflammatory burden observed in people with chronic periodontitis could represent the driver of telomere shortening. However, further evidence is needed to confirm whether inflammation is the cause or the consequence of the shorter leukocyte telomere length observed in people with periodontitis.

Pharmacokinetic changes of ipriflavone in rats with acute renal failure induced by uranyl nitrate.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of ipriflavone were compared after intravenous (20 mg/kg) and oral (200 mg/kg) administration in control rats and in rats with acute renal failure induced by uranyl nitrate (U-ARF rats). It was expected that the time-averaged nonrenal clearance (Cl(nr)) of ipriflavone in U-ARF rats could be significantly slower than in the control rats, since it was reported that ipriflavone was metabolized via the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1/2 and 2C11 and the expression and mRNA level of CYP1A2 were not changed, but those of CYP2C11 were decreased in U-ARF rats compared with control rats. Unexpectedly, after intravenous administration in U-ARF rats, the Cl(nr) of ipriflavone was significantly faster than in the controls (40.8 compared with 29.0 ml/min/kg). This may be due to an increase in the glucuronide conjugate formation of ipriflavone metabolites in U-ARF rats. After oral administration of ipriflavone in U-ARF rats, the AUC(0-24 h) was significantly smaller (194 compared with 295 microg min/ml) than in the controls.

Americans were voting in numbers unprecedented since women were given the franchise in 1920. Secretaries of state predicted turnouts approaching 90 percent in Virginia and Colorado and 80 percent or more in big states like Ohio, California, Texas, Missouri and Maryland.Though the exact numbers won't be determined until all the votes are counted in the next few days and weeks, a history-making high percentage of Americans voted, according to CNN and the Wall Street Journal:

More than 30 million voters had already cast ballots before Tuesday in early voting. Nearly 100 million more were expected on election day. Hundreds of thousands of voters waited from long before daybreak or for hours on end to make their choices known.

Michael McDonald, a politics professor at Virginia's George Mason University, predicted nearly 65% of the electorate would have voted by the time all polls closed -- matching or eclipsing the turnout in the presidential election of 1960 featuring candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Not since 1908, when the U.S. was convulsing through a shift from the machine party politics of the 19th century to the free-for-all of modern campaigns, has so large a proportion of Americans participated in a presidential election.

It was a good job! I'm glad you noticed. Maybe once you veer out of fantasyland you'll be able to see just how good a guy is that we just elected - smart, honest and articulate, all the things that the last President was not.

Grand Central Theatre. 33 Grand Central Terminal,. New York,. NY. 10017. 33 Grand Central Terminal,New York, NY 10017. 4 13 comments). Auditorium with 242 seats pictured in this 1937 trade report: Boxoffice. The April 1, 1937, issue of Motion Picture Daily said that the opening of the newsreel theater being built inside Grand Central Station had been set for May 3.. I passed by it many times but never went in. (In the early 1970’s, when I was going to college and Amtrak trains on the old New York Central lines were still leaving from Grand Central, I had to change stations in New York.) I distinctly recall that on one occasion, oe of the last times I saw the theater in operation, the program was the 1971 documentary “The Hellstrom Chronicle”, so the end must have come around 1973 or thereabouts.. Another thing: it probably was an inspiration for a strip in the comic series “Julis Knipl: Real Estate Photographer”, which takes place in such a theater.

New home, same life

New home, same life

My family and I finally moved into our house in the Diamond New Housing Scheme. I can’t say that I like it nor can I say I hate it. The traveling is hard and the morning traffic is harder but the place has a certain quietness to it that I like.

It’s been a long time since my mother, younger brother and I have shared a home together. At my age, I think I’ve spent too much time chasing life and chasing causes and not enough time seeing the people I love. A big part of loving people is witnessing their lives and caring about what you witness. I’ve been working on it.

And of course, I’ve got some interesting neighbours and naturally I’ve got that one neighbour that’s the epitome of jackassifiyishness. Almost every weekend they vibrate my windows with their huge music box while their battalion of children back-ball and juk the floor, the wall and each other. Sigh. I’m trying hard to mind my own business.

Just before the rain started this morning, I helped my mom wash. We used blue-soap, hard-brush and scrubbing-board. These days I look forward to washing with mom. I’ve seen her age these last few years and it forced me to accept that my time with her is not endless. Time is not endless for us.

I wait up for my brother at nights now and we do dumb things or watch pointless TV. I’m watching him become a man and I know that I won’t always be around to witness his life first hand. There’s no telling where life will take us. My mother’s eldest sister has lived in another country for most of their lives and they haven’t seen each other in years. One day, distance may stretch between my brother and I and we’ll fill that space with memories and Skype and annual visits.

This is also the first time in more than 15 years that I haven’t lived with Nani. She is there in her house and I am here in mine. Sometimes, it feels as if our worlds are not the same and never were and never could be but every now and then we meet and we laugh. Laughing makes everything better.

Life will never be perfect and happiness is not constant. But who wants that? Seriously, perfect and constant are predictable and boring.

Facial Implants. Bergen Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery in Hackensack, Westwood, Ridgewood NJ. Facial implants are used to enhance certain features of your face, including your cheeks or your jaw line. The surgery may be elective, or part of the reconstruction of the face due to an accident or illness, or needed as the result of prior surgery on the face. Through a facial implant, a maxillofacial surgeon can aesthetically improve facial contours.. Depending on your medical history and your overall objectives of this surgery — our doctors can recommend several courses of action. Surgery can be done with local anesthesia with an oral sedative to help you relax or general anesthesia which means you’ll be put to sleep. The length of surgery will depend on which part of your face is affected, but it commonly lasts between one to two hours. You may want to consider lower jaw, cheek or chin implants.. -.

(Reuters) - Hudbay Minerals on Tuesday vowed to appeal a court ruling that barred the Canadian miner from building a major copper mine in the United States after losing its bid to have a judge revisit the decision.

U.S. District Judge James Soto late on Monday said there was no basis to reconsider an earlier ruling that overturned approvals for the company’s contentious Rosemont project in southeastern Arizona, delivering a setback for Hudbay as it seeks to revive plans for the stalled $1.9 billion open-pit mine.

Hudbay’s director of investor relations, Candace Brule, said the company was disappointed with the decision and would proceed with an appeal as it studies next steps for the project.

“This ruling confirms that the court continues to misinterpret decades of precedent and the federal regulations and mining laws that govern the Rosemont project,” she said.

At issue is the validity of mining claims that would allow the company to dispose of mine waste on public lands adjacent to its operations.

The U.S. District Court for Arizona in July overturned approvals issued by the U.S. Forest Service for the mine, siding with environmental and tribal groups opposed to the plan.

Hudbay in August said it would appeal that ruling but it first asked the court to reconsider the decision on grounds it overstepped its authority.

However, Soto said there was no basis to reopen the case, according to a copy of the decision seen by Reuters. “Mere disagreement with a previous order is an insufficient basis for reconsideration,” the judge wrote.

Hudbay had planned to start construction of Rosemont by the end of this year, with first production expected by the end of 2022.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto says Texas' decision to deploy National Guard troops along the border is "unpleasant" and "reprehensible."

Last month's deployment had previously drawn Mexico's ire. It says the border should not be militarized and issues should be solved jointly.

In an interview with the newspaper El Universal published Friday, Pena Nieto said Texas' move could affect bilateral relations.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry has criticized border security and suggested last month that Islamic terrorists could be entering the U.S. from Mexico, a charge Mexico has dismissed as "absurd."

Texas says it needs to deploy National Guard troops to stop drug traffickers. The number of Central American migrants entering Texas also spiked earlier this year, but the flow has since declined.

NEWS. September 2013 High-Efficiency Ducted Steerprop Azimuth Propulsors for three vessels to be built in China. High-Efficiency Ducted Steerprop Azimuth Propulsors for three vessels to be built in China.. In late August and early September 2013, Steerprop Ltd. signed contracts with Chinese customers to deliver main propulsion azimuth propulsors for three offshore support vessels due to be built in China in 2014. All three vessels will be equipped with two 2000 kW SP 25 D Ducted Azimuth Propulsors. The propulsors will be delivered in mid-2014.. All of these propulsors will be equipped with the Steerprop HJ3 high efficiency nozzle. These high efficiency nozzles are hydrodynamically optimized to improve bollard pull without compromising free running efficiency. This combination of thrust and efficiency is sometimes very important in vessels that require both high bollard pull and efficiency such as Platform Support Vessels or other Offshore Support Vessels.

Q:

How do I find out which processes are causing the most disk activity?

I am hoping to find a way to do more performance monitoring--specifically, I hope that monitoring disk activity on a per-process basis will help me decide which programs are causing the most trouble (aside from the AV).   I'd rather avoid a shotgun approach.
For windows XP, is there a process monitor that can give me a solid idea of which processes are slowing me down by causing the most page faults, etc?  Thanks!

A:

Perhaps enabling the I/O reads and writes in the task manager (ctrl+shift+esc).  When looking at the processes in task manager select View then Select Columns.  Look for the I/O read optiona nd I/O write option and click them.  
This is what I get:

A:

While I prefer the accepted answer, there is another way with the existing task manager.

Task manager > Performance (tab) > Resource Monitor (button) > Disk (tab)

A:

I like the freeware Process Explorer.  It provides a bit more detail than the Windows Task Manager, including per-process I/O graphs.  Great for immediately spotting processes doing a lot of disk I/O.

Efficient infection from cDNA clones of cucumber mosaic cucumovirus RNAs in a new plasmid vector.
Full-length cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV) cDNAs were cloned into a new plasmid vector containing a modified plant virus promoter designed to transcribe the inserted sequence from its first nucleotide. cDNA copies of CMV strain Q (Q-CMV) genomic RNAs 1, 2 and 3 cloned into this vector were infectious when inoculated together, producing symptoms indistinguishable from those caused by wildtype Q-CMV infection. The infectivity of the clones could be substantially increased by excision of the viral insert together with the transcriptional promoter and terminator prior to inoculation. A diagnostic but silent mutation was introduced into the RNA 2 cDNA and found to be stably maintained in viral infection, allowing distinction of the recombinant virus from native contaminants. The infectious cDNA clones supported the replication of CMV satellite RNA when co-inoculated with biologically active Q-CMV satellite RNA transcripts. Using the infectious cDNAs described, it was found that a newly-identified overlapping gene (2b) encoded by Q-CMV RNA 2 was not essential for either systemic viral infection of Nicotiana glutinosa or replication of the satellite RNAs.

Jennifer Hinton at the Guardian:. The issue of austerity versus stimulus is often framed as the entire debate – if you don’t support one, you must support the other, because there are no alternatives. This is the same binary debate that has been going on for more than 100 years between the state versus the market. Yet, these dichotomies distract people from thinking about what’s really important – the goal of these policies, which is to grow the economy.. No analysis I’ve read thus far has questioned the damaging role that the endless quest for economic growth plays. Neither austerity nor government stimulus will ever be able to address the debt crises and recessions of the twenty-first century because what we’re dealing with here is an inherent contradiction of capitalism.

Q:

Was Michael Fassbender actually under the head for most of the movie?

In Frank (2014), the titular character Frank wears a big fake head for most of the movie. Is it Michael Fassbender who's under that head most of the movie? Or did he just act in the scenes in the last 15 min of the movie?

A:

I follow Jon Ronson (the writer of "Frank") on Twitter, and he has answered that question a few times, reporting that Fassbender did wear the mask all the time. There is a Q&A with the cast of the movie on the Collider website, and Michael Fassbender gives more details.

FASSBENDER: Yeah, I found it really liberating.  The only thing that
it took a bit of getting used to – or never really getting used to –
was when we were doing the performances, the sound in there.  You
know, I would go away and I was learning an accent and I’m practicing
it like this and then once you put the head on, there’s a reverb thing
that’s going on in there and it kind of puts the hearing off a little
bit, and it’s hard to sort of locate some stuff, but that was it.
The
rest was a lot of fun.  It was really cool.  It was like, as soon as I
put the head on it gave me an element of mischief.  It gives it sort
of the anarchic quality of Chris Sievey’s original Frank Sidebottom
character.  I think [he] really sort of came out in that.
And also,
it’s exactly what Lenny was saying.  For the other actors, it never
mattered that I couldn’t make eye contact really with other actors
because Frank is Frank and Frank lives in his own universe, and so I
was hoping for them, it would be the same.  Is he listening?  Is he
not listening?  Did he hear that?  They’re used to him anyway.  Except
for Domhnall’s character, which is a new introduction, everybody’s
used to Frank with the head on.  ‘Oh, that’s just Frank doing his
thing,’ or whatever it is.  Whether I was engaged or not engaged, both
times I think it was a help for me and hopefully for the other guys
that were responding to him.

And later, from the same interview:

FASSBENDER: It was hot and sweaty in there sometimes.  If you’re
running around in there, you can’t breathe as easy as you would
without it, but like I say, I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed having the head
on.  I actually wanted to bring it on to my next job.  They wouldn’t
let me.  [Laughs]

Although, they did have a second head for the stuntman. The only time Fassbender wasn't wearing it.

GLEESON: There’s another one for the stuntman that had little bits cut
out.  The one time it’s not Michael is when the guy gets knocked over
by the car.
